 ? SustainabilityofEconomicGrowthandControllingInflation:TheWayForward   (AddressbyDr.SubirGokarn,DeputyGovernor,ReserveBankofIndiaatFICCI's NationalExecutiveCommitteeMeetingatMumbai,April5,2011) ItismypleasuretospeakatFICCIsNationalExecutiveCommitteeMeetingthisyear. Asmanyobservershavebeenhighlighting,afterarelativelylongphaseofbenign, growth?friendlymacroeconomicconditions,thingshavebeguntolooksomewhat hostileonthemacroeconomicfront.Themostsignificantmanifestationofthisisthe accelerationofinflation,atrendthatwasvisibleevenbeforetheimpactofthe financialcrisiswasfeltinlate2008,butwhichveryquicklyandstronglyre?emerged astheeconomybegantorecoverinthesecondhalfof2009?10.Despitesignificant actionsonbothpolicyratesandliquiditybytheReserveBank,inflationremainshigh, giving rise to some very fundamental questions: is this high rate of inflation, previouslybelievedtobeunacceptable,nowthenewnormal?Isitanunavoidable pricetopayforsustainingthecurrentgrowthtrend?Or,willitactuallyworkto underminethesustainabilityofthecurrenttrend? Beforearrivingatafirmpolicypositiononthisissue,wemustexaminealltherisks associatedwithpersistentlyhighratesofinflationoverrelativelylongperiodsof time.Inthisaddress,Iproposetodothreethings: 1.

Examine the drivers of the recent trends in inflation and relate them to underlyinggrowthdrivers; 3. PresentsomekeyissuesandconcernsthatIbelieveshouldinfluenceour policythinking.

Inputs from Bhupal Singh, Sitikantha Pattanaik and Mridul Saggar are gratefully  acknowledged.  1 First,wedoseeastrikingcontrastbetweenthetwoepisodesofhighgrowththatthe economyexperiencedafter1991.Duringthefirstepisode,1994?951996?97,both measuresofinflationranrelativelyhigh.Infact,thegrowthbegantoacceleratein themidstofanalreadyuncomfortableinflationaryenvironment,reflectedbyboth theheadlineandcoremeasures.Theproximitybetweenthetwosuggestedthat demandpressureswerepredominant.Inthisscenario,theonlywaythatinflation wouldcomedownwouldbethroughdemandcompressionandthatisindeedwhat happened.Ananti?inflationarymonetarystancecombinedwithashocktoexportsin thewakeoftheEastAsiancrisisandabadmonsoonachievedthis.Overthenextfew years,bothgrowthandinflationrateswererelativelylow. Thesecondhigh?growthepisodebeganin2003?04and,withtheexceptionofthe slowdownduringthecrisisperiod,isstillcontinuing.However,fromtheinflation perspective,thisepisodeitselfhastwodistinctsegments.Inthefirstfewyears,high growthwasaccompaniedbylowinflation,bothheadlineandcore.Ontheeveofthe crisisperiod,bothindicatorsincreasedsignificantly,suggestingtheemergenceof demand?sidepressures.Duringthebriefslowdown,bothinflationindicatorsdropped sharply,butcorefellfarmorethanheadline,indicatingthatsupply?sidepressures werenowvisible.Theresurgenceofinflationoverthepastyearistheresultofboth demand and supply forces, as can be seen from sharp climb in both inflation indicatorsandthepersistentgapbetweenthem. Oneimpressionfromthecontrastbetweenthesetwoepisodesisthatgrowthina low?inflationenvironmentcanbemorerobustandenduring.Thisispartlybecause monetarypolicycanaffordtoaccommodategrowthbykeepinginterestrateslow. However,aswesaw,eveninthemorerecentepisode,demandpressureswere drivinginflationup,whichsawthemonetarypolicystance,whichIshalldiscussin somewhat more detail later, reverse course during that period. A second observation,relatingtorecentdevelopments,isthat,whilesupply?sidepressures haveclearlyimpactedheadlineinflation,therelativelybriefandshallowslowdown didnotfullyeliminatedemand?sidepressuresfromthesystemandthesetoohave contributedtotherecentbehaviourofinflation. Forcomparisonpurposes,IwillbrieflydiscusstheChinesegrowth?inflationdynamics beforecomingbacktoamoredetaileddiscussionofrecentIndianpatterns.Slide2 depicts the growth rates achieved by the Chinese economy since its own liberalizationofthelate1970sandthebehaviourofitsConsumerPriceIndexover theperiod.Twoepisodesoneinthelate1980sandoneinthemid?1990sstand out.Inboth,asharpriseintheinflationratewasfollowedbyadeclineinthegrowth 2 rate.

RecentInflationDynamics Toprovideabackdrop,letmefirsttalkaboutsomeimportantcharacteristicsofthe recentepisodeoffastgrowth.Slide4displaystheannualcontributiontogrowth madebyeachofthecomponentsofaggregatedemand.PrivateConsumption,the largest single component makes a steady contribution throughout the period, a factorinfluencedbyitssheersize.But,themostsignificantfeatureoftheperiodis therelativelylargeandsustainedcontributionofcapitalformation,orinvestment. The acceleration in growth seen since 2003?04 was preceded by a surge in investmentspending,whichthenremainedaverysignificantcontributortogrowth over the entire episode. It slumped during the crisis period, reflecting its high sensitivitytomacroeconomicconditions,butrecoverednoticeablyinthefollowing year. Whenwebringtheinflationtrajectorybackintothepicture,wemightinferthatthe combination of fast growth and low inflation is actually very conducive to high investment spending. With reference to todays theme, this is obviously a relationshipofgreatsignificance.Investmenthasthetwinvirtuesofcreatingdemand forgoodsandservicesinthepresentwhilesimultaneouslyexpandingthecapacityto producetheminthefuture.Itfollowsthatagrowthprocessthatismoreconducive to investment spending is more likely to be sustainable than one that is less conducive.TherecentepisodeoffastgrowthinIndiasuggeststhatlowinflationis one factor that encourages investment spending. From this perspective, the 3 reduction of the contribution of investment to growth in 2010?11 raises some concerns. LetmenowprovidesomeperspectivesonrecentinflationdynamicsinIndia.Slide5 displaystherelativecontributionsofdifferentcomponentsoftheWPItoaggregate inflationoverthepastdecade.Thereareanumberofsignificantpatternsinthe graph.First,foodinflationmayhavegrabbedtheheadlinesinrecentmonths,butthe factisthatithasbeensteadilyincreasingitscontributiontooverallinflationforsome timenow.Acombinationoffactorsmayhaveaggravatedthesituationintherecent past,buttheimpactofsustainedhighgrowthonfoodconsumptionpatternscannot bewishedaway.Intheabsenceofastrongsupplyresponse,increasingdemandwill inevitablyleadtohigherprices,atrendthatmaybereinforcedbyamonsoonfailure orothershocks.Thisiswhatweareseeingonthefoodfronttoday. Second,eventhoughcrudeoilpriceswereincreasingsteadilyoverthisperiod,the contribution of energy prices to inflationwas variable. This was the result of a combinationofdifferentialratesofannualincreasesandrestrictionsonpass?through to domestic consumers. In fact, during the three?year period 2005?08, while aggregateinflationremainedrelativelysteady,therelativecontributionsoffoodand energyswappedpositions.Inasense,incipientfoodinflationwasbeingoffsetbythe moderatingcontributionfromoil. Third,non?foodmanufacturinginflation,which,asIindicatedearlier,weinterpretas reflecting demand?side pressures, while contributing to inflation throughout the period,wasfairlysteady.However,in2007?08,asoverallinflationaccelerated,sodid thiscomponent.Oneexplanationforthisisthat,withcapacitiesbeingstretched, producershadsignificantpricingpower.Consequently,theintensificationofsupply? sidedrivers,whichisclearlyvisibleinthegraphthatyear,spilledoverintoamore generalizedinflationaryprocess.Ofcourse,thepicturechangeddramaticallyduring thecrisisperiod,butitisstrikingthatin2010?11,thepatternisquitesimilar,with theaddedcontributionfromrisingnon?foodprimaryarticles.Wedoappeartobein asituationinwhichcapacityconstraintsarehelpingconvertsupply?sidepressures intogeneralizedinflation.If,infact,thecontributionofinvestmentspendingto growth is declining, the constraints can only become more binding, further aggravatinginflationarypressuresifthegrowthmomentumiskeptgoingbyother componentsofdemand. Iwillendthissectionwithabriefdiscussiononthemonetaryandfiscalpolicy trajectoriesduringthisperiod.Slide6displaysthemovementofmonetarypolicy instrumentsbefore,duringandafterthecrisisperiod.Inthefirstphasedepictedon 4 thegraph,therewasasteadyreductioninpolicyrates,motivatedbyamoderating inflationscenario.Thiswaspresumablysupportiveofinvestmentactivity,which,as we saw earlier, wasrelativelybuoyant during thisperiod.

Astheimpactofthecrisiswasfelt,thereasasharpreversalinallpolicyinstruments, amovementconsistentwiththeinflationarypatternduringtheyear,asseenbythe complete disappearance of non?food manufacturing inflation. As the economy recovered,bringingwithitaratherquickresurgenceofinflationarypressures,the monetary stance has responded. The pace of action has been influenced by a numberofdomesticandglobalfactors;theprimarymotivationbeingtokeepthe recoverygoing,whilepreventingthespill?overofsupply?sidepressuresintoamore generalizedinflationaryprocess. Slide7displaystrendsinthefiscalposition,showingthecombinedrevenueandfiscal deficitsforcentreandstates.ThemainpointthatIwouldliketomakefromthis pictureiswithreferencetothefastgrowthepisodeof2003?08.Onthefiscalfront, thisperiodwascharacterizedbyasteadydeclineinthecombinedfiscaldeficit,but, mostimportantly,averysharpdeclineintherevenuedeficit.Whatthismeantwas that not only was the government claiming relatively fewer resources, it was devotingagreaterproportionofitsspendingtocreatingcapitalassets.Intermsof thevirtuouscombinationofhighgrowth,lowinflationandhighinvestmentthatI havealreadycharacterizedtheepisodeby,thesefiscalcharacteristicsaddanother dimensiontotheunderstandingofconditionsconducivetosustaininggrowth. TheWayForward:IssuesandConcerns Iwouldliketohighlightthreekeymessagesfromtheprecedingdiscussionaswelook aheadatthechallengesofsustaininggrowthwhilecontrollinginflation.First,from ourownexperience,lowinflationandfiscalmoderation,particularlyontherevenue deficit,seemtobeconducivetohighinvestmentratesand,consequently,tohigh andsustainablegrowthrates.Second,whengrowthisrelativelyrapid,supply?side inflationary pressures do spill over into more generalized inflation, presumably reflectinghighpricingpowerofallproducers,includingworkers.Theimplicationsof 5 thisformonetarypolicyarequiteclearanddirect:iftherearesignsofspill?overfrom supply?sidetocore,thenamonetaryresponseiswarrantedtopreventtheprocess from spiralling out of control. Third, looking back at the previous high?growth episode,slowergrowthoveraperiodoftimewillresultinlowerinflation,butwe mustrecognizethatbothhighinflationandslowgrowthhavesignificantwelfare costs.Inessence,thechallengeistokeepgrowthashighaspossiblewithouttherisk ofinflationspirallingoutofcontrol. Inthiscontext,therearetwobodiesofevidencethathaveabearingonpolicies intending to sustain growth while controlling inflation. First, analysis of a large sampleofcountriesoverlongperiodsoftimedoesnotsuggestthatmorerapid growthphaseswereaccompaniedbyhigherratesofinflation.Therehave,ofcourse, beenperiodswheninflationrateshavebeenhigh,butthesehavetypicallybeen followedbyaslowdowningrowthrates,presumablyasaresultofmonetaryactions but,morefundamentally,becausetheprospectofmacroeconomicinstabilitymay leadtolowerratesofinvestment.Ingeneral,theevidenceacrossalargesetof countriesbearsoutwhatweobservedinIndiaoverthehighgrowthepisodeinIndia immediatelybeforethecrisisperiodandalsoinChinaoverthepastdecade.Faster growthseemstopersistinanenvironmentoflowinflation. Second,recentanalyticalworkonthePhillipsCurve,whichrepresentsthetrade?off betweengrowth(unemployment)andinflationsuggestsabreakintherelationship betweengrowthandinflationatsomethresholdrateofinflation(SeeofAkerlof,et 1 2 3 al.,2000 andPalley,2003 ,2008 ).Ifinflationisbelowthatrate,theanalysis suggeststhatthere is atrade?off between growthand inflation; growth can be accelerated(unemploymentcanbereduced)withsomeconcomitantincreasein inflation.However,abovethatthreshold,therelationshipisreversed;higherratesof inflation are accompanied by slower growth (higher unemployment). The main reason for the existence of such a threshold rate of inflation is the speed and magnitudewithwhichtheinflationratefeedsintoinflationaryexpectations.Below thethreshold,workersandproducersdonotraisetheirwageandpricedemands very often because the impact of inflation is not too visible. By contrast, they respond very quickly above the threshold because they are worried that high inflation will rapidly erode their living standards or profitability. In short, when inflationishigh,thebehaviourofworkersandproducersincreasesthelikelihood thatitwillincreasefurther. Puttingthetwotogether,onecouldarguethatkeepinginflationbelowthethreshold atalltimesservesboththeshorttermobjectiveofmacroeconomicstability,or 6 minimizingthedeviationofthegrowthratefromitssustainabletrend,andthelong? termobjectiveofraisingthetrendbyencouraginginvestmentactivity.Doweknow whatthethresholdisfortheIndianeconomy?TheReportonCurrencyandFinance, anannualresearchpublicationoftheReserveBankofIndia,examinedthisquestion inits2000?01issueandcametotheconclusionthatthegrowth?maximizingrateof 4 inflationfortheIndianeconomywas5percent. Ofcourse,inarapidlyevolving environment,thisnumbercouldwellbedifferentnow;theaveragerateofinflation duringthepre?crisisperiodhighgrowthepisodewasslightlybelowthisnumber.But, evenifitisdifferent,itisunlikelytobesignificantlyhigher.Thecurrentrateof inflationdoesraiseconcernsabouttherisksofspiralling,ashighinflationbecomes increasinglyentrenchedintothewageandpricesettingbehaviourofworkersand producers.Inturn,ifthisweretoadverselyimpactinvestmentactivity,thegrowth momentumwouldinevitablyslowdown.Inessence,thetrade?offismorebetween inflationnowandgrowthinthefuture. BeforeIconclude,Iwouldliketobrieflyaddresstheveryfundamentalissueoffood inflation.Slide8displaystherelativecontributionsmadebydifferentfoodgroupsto overall food inflation. For much of the past several months, the dominant contributorstoithavebeenpulses,milk,eggs,fishandmeatandfruits.Cerealshave madevirtuallynocontribution,whilevegetables,withtheexceptionoftheonion spike(othervegetablesalsocontributed)inlate2010,werenotverysignificant contributors.Toreiterateapointwehavebeenmakinginbothourpolicystatements andothercommunications:thispatternistheoutcomeofconsumptionbaskets beingdiversifiedbyanincreasingnumberofhouseholdsastheycrosssomeincome threshold.Theincreaseinpricesindicatesthatsupplyisjustnotkeepingpacewith demand.Theonlywaytokeepfoodpricesincheckistoproducemoreofwhat peoplewanttoconsume.ThereareseveralinitiativesintheUnionBudgetfor2011? 12, which are based on this recognition. Now, the emphasis must be on implementingtheschemesforquickincreasesinproductivityandoutputofthe itemsinquestion. ConcludingRemarks Ibeganbyraisingthreequestions:isthishighrateofinflation,previouslybelievedto be unacceptable, now the new normal? Is it an unavoidable price to pay for sustainingthecurrentgrowthtrend?Or,willitactuallyworktounderminethe sustainabilityofthecurrenttrend? Basedontheprecedingdiscussion,letmeattemptacombinedanswer.Acceptance ofahigherrateofinflationasthenewnormal?aninevitableconsequenceofrapid 7 growthwillraiserisksofacceleratinginflation.Inturn,thisislikelytoweaken incentivesforinvestment,whichwillthreatenthesustainabilityofgrowth.Thisisa viciouscircleofhighinflation,lowinvestmentandslowinggrowth. The alternative is the kind of virtuous circle that the economy has already experiencedduringthefiveyearsprecedingthecrisisperiod.Thiswascharacterized bylowinflation,highinvestmentandfiscalconsolidation,particularlyontherevenue account,accompanyinghighgrowthaswellasresilienceduringthecrisisperiod. Thatistheconfigurationthatweneedtore?createtosustaingrowth.

Ishallendwithreferencetothetopicoftodaysaddress.Theissueisnotsomuch oneofhigherinflationforfastergrowthinthepresent.Itisabouttherisksthat higher inflation now poses for faster growth in the future. In other words, sustainabilityofgrowthoverthelongtermdoesrequirecontrollinginflation.
