Ownership and governance*in private sector banks in IndiaI am grateful to the Confederation of Indian Industries to arrange aseminar on a subject of great importance today.  This gives me anopportunity to discuss the issues with various stakeholders.On July 2, 2004, RBI issued draft guidelines on ownership andgovernance in private sector banks in India. These guidelines wereplaced in the public domain  for wider debate and feedback. The RBI isto put out a second draft and then finalise the policy taking intoaccount the feedback received. The intention is to continuestrengthening the Indian Banking System and keep moving towardsinternational best practice through a  consultative process.If the importance of the issue of ownership and governance in banks isto be gauged by the number of responses received to any  publicdocument issued by RBI then I would say that it is overwhelminglyimportant!We had said in the guidelines that banks are special. Severalresponses have been received asking us what we mean by ‘special’.Banks are financial intermediaries critical for mobilising public savingsand for deploying them to provide safety and return to the savers.They thus have fiduciary responsibility. The deployment of funds                                                * Address by Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at Conference on Ownership andGovernance in Private Sector Banking organised by Confederation of Indian Industries at Mumbai onSeptember 9, 20041mobilized through deposits involves banks in financing economicactivity and providing the lifeline for the payments system. The bankingsystem is something that is central to a nation’s economy; and thatapplies whether the banks are locally- or foreign-owned.The owners or shareholders of the banks have only a minor stake andconsidering the leveraging capacity of banks ( more than ten to one) itputs them in control of very large volume of public funds of which theirown stake is miniscule. In a sense, therefore, they act as trustees andas such must be fit and proper for the deployment of funds entrustedto them. The sustained stable and continuing operations depend onthe public confidence in individual banks and the banking system. Thespeed with which a bank under a run can collapse is incomparablewith any other organisation. For a developing economy like ours thereis also much less tolerance for downside risk among depositors manyof whom place their life savings in the banks. Hence from a moral ,social, political and human angle, there is a more onerousresponsibility on the regulator. Millions of depositors of the bankswhose funds are entrusted with the bank are not in control of theirmanagement.Thus, concentrated shareholding in banks controlling huge publicfunds does pose issues related to the risk of concentration ofownership because of the moral hazard problem and linkages ofowners with businesses. Hence diversification of ownership isdesirable as also ensuring fit and proper status of such owners anddirectors. At the same time with diversified ownership, there is,2perhaps, even greater concern over corporate governance andprofessional management, in view of this, apart from ensuring fit andproper considerations, in order to safeguard depositors interest andensure systemic stability,  the regulatory and supervisory frameworkhas to ensure that banks have adequate capital to cushion risks thatare inevitable in their operations, follow prudent and transparentaccounting practices and are managed in accordance with the bestpractices for risk management. Seen from this standpoint, greatresponsibility is imposed on the regulator.The issue has been raised as to why now- what is new that theseconcerns are being raised now? After nationalisation of major banks in1969 and in 1980, in a sense, being government owned the issue didnot arise till recently. As part of financial sector reform and keeping inview the growth needs of the economy it is expected that thesignificance and share of the private sector banks will increase as alsopublic shareholding in the public sector banks within the current policyframework. The banks are expected to grow with the economy. Thereis also opening up of the economy and increasing integration with theglobal economy. As this happens, the regulator has to ensure that thebanking system is strong, healthy and resilient to withstand shocks.We also want to ensure that transparency improves and want to moveto international best practices in regulation, supervision, riskmanagement while at same time calibrating the suitability to thedomestic conditions and needs at the current stage of development3Key Features of the GuidelinesTo begin with, let me enumerate the salient features of the guidelines.1. All shareholding of 5 per cent and above representing importantshareholding will have to meet the ‘fit and proper’ tests ofcompetence, reputation, track record, integrity, satisfactoryoutcome of financial vetting, source of funds and so on.  Wherethe applicant is a body corporate, fit and proper would includegood corporate governance, financial strength and integrity inaddition to the assessment of individuals and other entitiesassociated with the body corporate as enumerated above.2. In the interest of diversified ownership of banks, the objective willbe to ensure that no single entity or group of related entities haveshareholding or control, directly or indirectly, in any bank inexcess of 10 per cent of the paid up capital of the private sectorbank. Any higher level of acquisition will be with the priorapproval of RBI and in accordance with the guidelines ofFebruary 3,  2004. These guidelines state that where acquisitionor investment takes the shareholding of the applicant to a level of10 percent or more and up to 30 percent, the RBI will also takeinto account other factors including but not limited to thefollowing: (a) source and stability of the funds for the acquisitionand the ability to access financial markets as a source ofcontinuing financial support for the bank, (b) the business recordand experience of the applicant including any experience ofacquisition of companies, (c) the extent to which the corporate4structure of the applicant will be in consonance with effectivesupervision and regulation of the bank; and (d) in case theapplicant is a financial entity, whether the applicant is a widelyheld entity, publicly listed and a well established regulatedfinancial entity in good standing in the financial community. Inaddition as indicated in the July draft,  where the investing entityis a corporate entity, it will be seen whether there is diversifiedshareholding of the investing entity. For acquisition or investmentexceeding the level of 30 percent the criteria will also take intoaccount but will not be limited to whether (a) the acquisition is inpublic interest, (b) the desirability of diversified ownership ofbanks, (c) the soundness and feasibility of the plans of theapplicant for the future conduct and development of the businessof the bank; and (d) shareholder agreements and their impact oncontrol and management of the bank.3. The main difference between the February guidelines and theJuly draft is that the latter requires prior approval forshareholding above 10 per cent and is also applicable forexisting shareholding above such level. The criteria laid down inthe guidelines will be applicable equally for higher level ofacquisitions as also for time bound plan for continuance orreduction in cases where the limits exceed those indicated.4. Minimum of Rs 300 crore of net worth is perceived as beingdesirable on grounds of optimal operations and systemicstability. Banks with net worth lower than Rs 300 crore will be5encouraged to increase it to this level through organic orinorganic growth within a reasonable period.5. In case of new licenses, promoter’s shareholding will normally beexpected to be brought down to 10 per cent  in a period of threeyears even if higher to begin with.6. Large industrial houses as per existing policy will be permittedstrategic investment in banks up to 10 per cent  subject tofulfilling the other criteria.7. While guidelines have already been issued to banks and Fis inIndia to minimize cross holding to 5 per cent, symmetrically, thedraft guidelines require foreign banks  operating in India torestrict  their acquisition (either directly or through any entity inthe group) of shareholding in Indian banks to 5  per cent .8. The maximum limits for portfolio investment through stockexchanges by individual NRIs and FIIs at 5 per cent and 10 percent respectively and aggregate limits at 10 per cent (can beraised to 24 per cent through special resolution of general body)and 24 per cent (can be raised to 49 per cent through specialresolution of general body) respectively,  currently permissible,as reiterated in the GOI press note of March 5, 2004, have beenretained in the draft guidelines. These will be subject togovernment’s policy in this regard.  All cases of acquisition orholding of 5 per cent and above, in case of FIIs, will require6acknowledgment by RBI as per February 3, 2004 guidelines.Where the investing entity is a ‘sub account’,  full details of theinvestor/s and other particulars required for due diligence will becalled for.9. While most of the elements of the draft guidelines in case ofdirectors have been implemented already, the provision relatingto the desirable practice of having not more than one member offamily close relative or associate on the Board of a bank is yet tobe introduced.10. All transition arrangements for compliance with theguidelines for existing holdings will be subject to submission oftime bound action plans by the concerned banks. The intentionas already indicated will be to move towards the desiredobjectives in as non-disruptive a manner as possible.11. Continuing compliance of ‘fit and proper’ criteria forshareholders and directors will have to be ensured by the bankon an ongoing basis subject to independent verification by RBIwhere felt necessary.How did we come to devise these guidelines? Apart from an internalreview, we scanned international practice.International approaches7Internationally, the regulatory/supervisory approach has been evolvinginto cohesive and inclusive regulatory paradigm involving threedifferent monitoring perspectives on the overall functioning of banks –§ an enabling and proactive regulatory and supervisory oversight,§ internal control through a vibrant and professional Board and§ market disciplineAll three in isolation have their limitations and are effective differentiallybased on the overall systemic contexts such as the level of maturity ofthe economy, and hence the markets, the efficacy of the legal systemand the resolution mechanisms in place, the prevalent businessculture etc. Market discipline may not be very effective till transparentdisclosure requirements are put in place. Even then the ability of themarket to discipline the constituents would depend on its ownstructural strength as well as the economic setting in which it operates.Therefore a significant level of reliance has to be placed on internalcontrol effected through Board oversight. An important factor, in this context, that defines the business culture iswhat has come to be termed as “corporate governance”. It is anebulous concept whose essential elements were part of the businessethos in all societies but which has in recent times come under sharpfocus and acquired a heightened significance partly due to the processof globalization and the increasingly overarching role of business onthe society at large.From a banking industry perspective, corporate governance involvesthe manner in which the business and affairs of individual institutions8are governed by their  boards of directors and senior management,1affecting how banks :• set corporate objectives (including generating economic  returns to owners);• run the day-to-day operations of the business;• consider the interests of recognised stakeholders;• align corporate activities and behaviours with the  expectation that banks will operate in a safe and sound  manner, and in compliance with applicable laws and  regulations;• protect the interests of depositors.The two major concerns that arise in context of corporate governancein banks and need to be addressed are ( i) the concentration ofownership and (ii) the type of people who control the bank. Diversifiedownership becomes a necessary postulate as it provides balancingstakes which may not be possible otherwise, even in the case of votingright limits. A related concern is the ‘quality’ of control over thefunctioning of banks manifest in the credentials of the variousstakeholders.A survey of the regulatory regimes in major countries brings out thatmost of the regimes address these two concerns through a set ofrestrictions on the ownership of bank stock on the followingparameters:                                                1 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, ‘Enhancing Corporate Governance in Banking Organisations’,19999§ quantum of ownership by single person/associated persons§ ownership restrictions for domestic entities based on nature ofentity§ non-bank financial firms§ non-financial entities§ other banks§ ownership restrictions for foreign entitiesMajor inferences that can be drawn from the international practices areas follows :In most of the countries, ownership concentration is regulatedthrough a layered threshold structure as per which any personwishing to acquire/increase shareholding in a bank beyond thosethresholds would be required to seek regulatory approval . Thequalifying threshold level in most countries is 10%. Most of thecountries though do not have an explicit cap on the maximumshareholding by a single person/entity. The above structure applies todirect as well as indirect control by a person singly or jointlythrough a group of associates or related parties.The regulators give approvals on a case to case basis subject to anumber of considerations including the overall sectoral impact of thetransaction and the satisfaction of ‘fit and proper’ principles by theperson(s) acquiring the stake.Acquirers of shares beyond thresholds need to providecomprehensive information to the authorities for their approval10including the intent of purchase, terms and conditions, if any, mannerof acquisition, source of funds etc.In terms of the nature of the entity, non-banking financial firms andnon-financial firms are permitted to acquire shares in bankssubject to the overall ceilings in respect of single entity in mostcountries albeit with regulatory approval in most cases. The non-discriminative treatment of the two classes of entities is reflected indovetailing of the restrictive clauses, wherever applicable, with thenorms on ownership by single entity.Crossholding amongst banks i.e., acquiring shares in a bank byanother bank, directly or indirectly, is subject to regulatory approval inmost of the regimes and the thresholds, in some cases, are lower thanthose for non-bank entities.Background for the draft guidelinesHaving dealt with the international approaches , I would like tohighlight some facts and  developments which should serve as abackground information for this seminar.§ Unlike in many other countries, the various laws relating tobanking in India [Banking Regulation Act 1949, BankingCompanies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings Act, 1970and 1980, the State Bank of India Act 1955, the State Bank ofIndia (Subsidiary Banks) Act 1959] do not provide for prior11approval of the regulator for acquisition of significant ownershipin banks - either in the public sector or in the private sector.There is, therefore, a need for an articulation of policy in publicinterest and depositor’s interest.§ On February 3, 2004,  the Reserve Bank came out with theguidelines for acknowledgment for acquisition and transfer ofshares in private sector banks. These guidelines took intoaccount the emerging trends in banking and internationalpractices. For the first time, it was spelt out that the term ‘holding’will refer to both direct and indirect, beneficial or otherwise andwill be computed with reference to the holding of the applicant,relatives and associates.§ On 5 March 2004, press note 4 was issued by Government ofIndia covering foreign investment in banking. The operationalguidelines are yet to be issued. Hence the draft guidelines do notcover the policy in regard to investment by foreign banks or formof presence of foreign banks for which there will be separateguidelines. Before issuing these,  it is felt necessary tostreamline the national policy for ownership, domestic andforeign, and governance.§ On  June 25 2004,  ‘fit and proper’ criteria for directors of privatesector banks were spelt out by RBI based on qualification,expertise, track record and integrity of persons to be appointedas directors of banks. The process of due diligence is to beundertaken by the bank at time of appointment and renewal.§ On   July 6  2004, banks / FIs were advised that they should notacquire any fresh stake in a bank's equity shares, if by such12acquisition, the investing bank's/FI's holding exceeds 5 per centof the investee bank's equity capital.Why are the guidelines being made applicable for existing banks?        The banking sector is already quite large and widespread. Thereare several banks of varying sizes, composition of shareholding anddirectors. The issues of size and governance are extremely importantfrom point of view of financial stability. This draft policy is inconsonance of treating banks as special and is setting upfront a roadmap in a transparent manner for the existing investors to align theirpolicies and potential investors to make informed decisions. Theintention of the policy is to ensure adequate capital and consolidationin the banking industry with the regulator being aware of the intentionof existing and potential shareholders. Since one of the fundamentalpresumption in the policy is that any shareholding above 10 per centwould have to satisfy the regulator of the fit and proper status andsound governance principles on a continuing basis, it is necessary thatthe same principles are applicable to existing owners but done so in anon-disruptive and consultative fashion. In regard to banks permittedrecently or rehabilitated recently on the basis of specific approvals,the commitments made as part of the approval process wouldundoubtedly be taken into account as also continuing compliance with‘fit and proper’ and sound governance.  The same criteria asapplicable for higher level of ownership as articulated in the February3, 2004 would form the basis for dealing with the cases undertransition as well.13The discussion paper is an illustration to the consultative processthat has been increasingly adopted in the policy making by theReserve Bank.  As far as banking business is concerned, weappreciate the role of promoters in general and strategic investors inparticular; although the distinction between them is often blurred inpractice. The comments on the first draft of this discussion paper willdefinitely enable us to fine tune the policy for the better.14
