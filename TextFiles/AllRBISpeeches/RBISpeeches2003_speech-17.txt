•Infrastructure Development In India: Emerging ChallengesI. BACKGROUNDInfrastructure contributes significantly to economic development both by increasingproductivity and by providing amenities that enhance the quality of life.  The impact ofinfrastructure on economic growth is well documented internationally. In the Indian context too,elasticities of output with respect to various stocks of infrastructure indicate that the transportand communication sectors play a dominant role in explaining the variations in GDP and its sub-sectors. The index of industrial production is also found to track closely the movements in thecomposite index of infrastructure industries during the 1980s and the 1990s.Historically, it can perhaps be said that infrastructure development in India came to beexplicitly recognised as part of State responsibility during the regime of Emperor Sher Shah(1540-1545), when a multitude of infrastructure projects on irrigation and roads were completed,including the famous Grand Trunk Road linking the East and West extremities of the country.Another major turning point in the history of infrastructure development was the flagging off ofthe Indian Railways in 1853 during the British Raj.  The implementation of the NationalHighway Development Project, coupled with the Prime Minister’s Gram Sadak Yojana (ThestPrime Minister’s Rural Roads Plan) will perhaps mark a similar milestone in this, the 21century. The role of the State in putting in place an infrastructure network was also emphasizedby the National Planning Committee (1938) and the Bombay Plan (1944) in pre-independentIndia.  They provided the necessary building blocks for action on infrastructure under thesubsequent Plans in post-independent India when it largely remained a responsibility of the State.The major policy shift on infrastructure occurred in the 1990s when, along with other wideranging economic reforms, the sector was opened up to private and foreign participation in viewof its large financing needs. Macro ProjectionsThe Government of India constituted an Expert Group in October 1994 to consider issuesrelated to the commercialisation of infrastructure projects including institutional arrangements,legal frameworks and financial arrangements that would facilitate the free flow of resources toinfrastructure. The Group submitted its report in June 1996.The Group estimated infrastructure requirements up to 2005-06 based on annual GDPgrowth projections of 7.5 per cent during 1996-2001 and 8.5 per cent during 2001-2006. Clearly,the high growth of 7.3 per cent in 1994-95 and its continuation in 1995-96 were the buildingblocks for such projections. The rising trend in savings and investment also presented anoptimistic outlook for the future. The ratio of Gross Domestic Savings (GDS) to Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) had indicated a steady improvement since 1993-94, attaining its peak of 25.1 percent in 1995-96. In tandem, the ratio of Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF) to GDP alsoattained its peak at 26.8 per cent in 1995-96. Set against such a backdrop, the Expert Group feltthat the accelerating GDP would require, in turn, enhanced and accelerating investment in                                                • I am grateful to Mr.Y.S.P Thorat, Dr. Michael Patra, Ms. Jaya Mohanty and Dr. A.Prasad of the RBI for theirassistance. I have also received useful inputs from the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC).infrastructure in order to sustain the momentum of high growth. In line with the East Asianexperience, the Group felt that the sustained high growth would require a rise in the overallinvestment rate from the prevailing 25 per cent of GDP to about 29 per cent by 2000-01 and 31.5per cent by 2005-06. The achievement of 7.5 to 8.5 per cent annual GDP growth at suchinvestment levels would also require the Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) to decline toabout 3.5, a level achieved by only the most efficient economies. The rate of industrial growthwould also have to accelerate to 10.0-12.0 per cent per annum over the following 10 years.In line with such macro projections, infrastructure investment was projected to increasefrom 5.5 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to 7.0 per cent by 2000-01 and 8.0 per cent by 2005-06.This implied that the annual level of investment was to increase from Rs 600 billion in 1995-96to about Rs 1100 billion by 2000-01 and Rs 1800 billion by 2005-06 (at constant 1995-96prices). This also implied total infrastructure investment requirement of about Rs. 4000 – 4500billion between 1996 and 2001, which would rise to Rs 7500 billion between 2001-02 and  2005-06. Assuming that 30-35 per cent of total external capital inflows would go into the financing ofinfrastructure, the Group expected 15 per cent of total capital requirements of infrastructure to beexternally financed. The rest would have to be financed from domestic resources. The publicsector, the engine of infrastructure investments in the past, would continue to have a major rolein this sector, even as its share was expected to decline from over 80 per cent in 1995-96 to 55per cent by the end of 2005-06. The share of private sector investment in infrastructure wasprojected to rise from about 1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to 2.5 per cent by 2000-01 and 3.5 percent by 2005-06.  This meant that in absolute terms, this investment would have to rise fromabout Rs.120 billion in 1995-96 to Rs 380 billion in 2000-01 and Rs.800 billion in 2005-06.The subsequent reality has, however, turned out to be different. While the high growthmomentum had continued in 1996-97, GDP growth slumped to 4.8 per cent in 1997-98.Although there was some recovery with 6 per cent plus growth during 1998-2000, it has sinceremained far below the mark of 7 per cent plus attained during the high growth phase of 1994-97. GDP growth declined to 4.4 per cent in 2002-03, the lowest since 1992-93. On the whole, thephase from 1997-98 to 2002-03 has been marked by a decelerated growth of 5.3 per cent, muchlower than the average growth of 7.5 per cent attained  during  the  high  growth phase of 1994-95 to 1996-97 (Table 1).At the sectoral level, the continuing slowdown was reflected in the steep decline inindustrial growth from 9.6 per cent during the high growth phase (i.e., 1994-95 to 1996-97) to amere 4.8 per cent in the subsequent phase (i.e., 1997-98 to 2002-03). The industrial slowdownhas been led by a severe slackening in manufacturing growth from 12.2 per cent to a meagre 4.2per cent over the same corresponding period. Simultaneously, agricultural growth has dippedfrom 4.6 per cent during the high growth phase to a modest 1.0 per cent during the subsequentperiod, contributed, among others, by the monsoons being lower than the long period averagesince 1999-00.The most important negative development to have taken place is a marked deteriorationin public sector savings, which have turned negative and fallen from  1.3 per cent in 1997-98 to(-)2.5 per cent in 2001-02,  as against a positive 1.8 per cent of GDP during the high growthphase and 1.5 per cent in 1990-92.1The deteriorating fiscal health of both the Central and State Governments caused by highand increasing interest outgo coupled with a fall in the tax-GDP ratio has contributed to the sharpdecline in public sector savings. As a matter of fact, the gross tax-GDP ratio for the CentralGovernment declined from 9.3 per cent in the high growth phase to 8.7 per cent in thesubsequent period. At the beginning of the 1990s, it was 10.1 per cent. On the other hand,interest payments-GDP ratio for the Central Government increased to 4.6 per cent from 4.3 percent over the same reference period. The combined revenue deficit of central and stategovernments, which declined to 3.5 per cent of GDP in the high growth phase from 3.8 per centduring 1992-93 to 1993-94 increased substantially to 6.1 per cent in the subsequent period.Thus, more than 60 per cent of the borrowing to finance the fiscal deficit is going into currentaccount expenditures with little or no expected returns. With the declining or stagnant tax/GDPratio coupled with a deteriorating quality of government expenditure, there seems to be littleprospect of improvement in overall revenues. Interest payments can be expected to increasecontinuously along with revenue and fiscal deficits. Such a fiscal situation leaves few resourcesfor investment purposes. Consequently, contrary to projections made for a stable and constantlevel of public sector investment in infrastructure, actual public investment has been falling since1995-96.Apart from the deteriorating fiscal health of the Government (at both central and statelevels), the fall in public sector savings also reflects the operations of public sector enterprises inthe infrastructure sectors. The levy and collection of appropriate user charges for the delivery ofinfrastructure services is crucial for the financial health of public sector enterprises engaged inthese services. Although there is increasing understanding of this issue, progress in this area hasbeen minimal over the last decade. There has not been much headway in carrying forward themuch-needed pricing reforms in the railways, State Road Transport Corporations (SRTCs), StateElectricity Boards (SEBs) and urban water tariffs in terms of the levy of economic user charges.The fare freight ratio (earning per passenger km. vis-à-vis earning per tonne km.) continues to beone of the lowest in the world. It was at 0.31 in 2001-02 as against 0.30 in 1990-91 and 0.47 in1950-51. A scrutiny of the financial performance of SRTCs shows that only 87 per cent of costscould be recovered through revenue receipts in 1999-00, leading to a total loss of around Rs.19.5billion. The gap between the cost of supply of electricity and average tariff has worsened from alevel of 23 paise in 1992-93 to about 110 paise in 2001-02 with the result that revenues havedropped from 82 per cent of costs in 1992-93 to 69 per cent in 2001-02. Similarly, although theaverage cost of urban water per cubic metre is estimated to be about Rs.15, average watercharges are about a tenth of this cost. The political resistance encountered in recent years to therise in local telephone tariffs to economic levels is also indicative of the widespread reluctance topay user charges. The poor performance of public sector savings has to be seen in the light ofthese developments. This has clearly constrained the ability of the public sector to keep up publicinvestments in infrastructure at the required levels.Private corporate savings, which improved from 3.1 per cent of GDP during 1992-93 to1993-94 to 4.3 per cent during the high growth phase slipped to 3.9 per cent in the subsequentperiod, particularly under the weight of lower corporate profits. This could have resulted fromthe corporate restructuring necessitated by the impact of increased competition arising fromoverall opening of the economy. As a result, the overall GDS/GDP ratio came down to 23.1 per2cent during 1997-98 to 2001-02 from 24.4 per cent during 1994-95 to 1996-97, despite animprovement in household savings/GDP ratio from 18.3 per cent to 20.2 per cent during thesame period.As a consequence, the projected increase in investment has not taken place at the macrolevel or with reference to infrastructure. GDCF had improved to 25.8 per cent of GDP in the highgrowth phase from 23.3 per cent during the first phase of reforms (i.e., 1992-93 to 1993-94). Ithas subsequently declined to 23.9 per cent during 1997-98 to 2001-02 on account of a decline inboth private sector Gross Capital Formation(GCF) and public sector GCF to 15.8 per cent and6.6 per cent, respectively, as per cent of GDP from 16.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent during 1994-95to 1996-97. The private sector GCF has fallen under the weight of poor performance of thecorporate sector, down to 6.1 per cent from 8.2 per cent over the reference period,notwithstanding an improved performance of the household sector in the subsequent period.The acceleration in overall economic growth that had been envisaged in 1995-96 hasclearly not taken place. Instead, there has been a significant deceleration. The trend ininfrastructure investment has been correspondingly lower than that projected. The public sectorhas not been able to keep up the level of investment that was required and envisaged because offiscal deterioration. Similarly, the optimism with regard to increasing private participation ininfrastructure has also been belied. It is probably true that the enthusiasm related to private sectorinvestment in infrastructure in the mid-1990s has proved to be unrealistic all across the world.There were perhaps unrealistic expectations by prospective private sector investors about thepotential returns to equity, and that risks inherent to infrastructure were underestimated. The EastAsian financial crisis of 1997 also contributed to a general meltdown in the hitherto burgeoninggrowth in foreign direct investment in developing countries, particularly in infrastructure.Although India was not affected significantly by the East Asian crisis, it is likely that theaccompanying world economic slowdown affected domestic developments as well, particularlythrough the transmission of low product prices affecting corporate profits.Apart from the macro developments that have led to the slowdown in infrastructuredevelopment, the lack of adequate reform in the pricing and regulatory environment has alsoinhibited both public and private sector investment in India. Thus, it is equally important torevisit the framework for private investment in infrastructure in addition to the macroeconomiccorrections required.II. PERFORMANCE OF INFRASTRUCTUREAs already mentioned, in terms of actual outcome, expectations of the Expert Group oninfrastructure investment have not been fulfilled in the context of the subsequent macro-economic slowdown. The actual performance has been much lower than overall projectedinvestment in infrastructure as per cent of GDP during 1995-96 through 2001-02 (Table 2).Sector-wise, the projection remained higher than the actual throughout for ‘electricity, gas andwater supply’ and ‘railways’. In the case of ‘other transport’, ‘storage’ and ‘communications’,actual performance turned out close to the projection and even better than the latter for someyears.3Expressed as  a proportion of GDP the actual infrastructure investment undertaken in thepublic sector, overall and sector-wise, turned out to be lower all through than the Group’sprojections for 1995-96 to 1999-00, barring ‘communications’, in which case actual investmentin the public sector has been higher than the projection (Table 3).The actual performance of investment in infrastructure by the private sector alsoremained lower all through during 1995-96 to 1999-00 than what had been projected for‘railways’ and ‘communications’ (Table 4).  This is surprising since the data on privateinvestment in communications that are available in the National Accounts do not seem to havecaptured the substantial private investment that has actually taken place in telecommunications.Mobile telephone services, radio pager services, internet and other value added services thatwere introduced in the late 1990s were almost entirely in the private sector. Private investmentexceeded the projections for some years in the case of ‘electricity, gas and water supply’, ‘othertransport’ and even at the aggregate level of infrastructure investment by the private sector.This sectoral review suggests that the shortfall in actual infrastructure investment,expressed as a proportion of GDP in comparison with the projected proportions, has been greaterfor the public sector (about 33 per cent) than that in the private sector (about 10 per cent).However, the private sector shortfall has also been growing in recent years. These data suggestthat there has indeed been an appropriate private sector response, but which could have beenbetter if it had not been constrained by inadequate public policy action. For example, had thepower sector reform taken place, particularly  in the case of payment security, private sectorinvestment would have been significant in this sector. The challenge for inducing greaterinfrastructure investment in the future, therefore, relates to both enhancement of public sectorinvestment and also improvement in the policy framework for private investment. These issuesneed to be examined for each sector separately.As part of the plan to double per capita income over the 10 year period (2002-2012), theTenth  Five Year Plan has set for itself an ambitious target of 8.0 per cent per annum growth inGDP over the period 2002 to 2007. With the loosening of the various constraints on growth, theTenth Plan has also identified the lack of adequate infrastructure as one of the bindingconstraints on the growth process. It has advocated increased public investment in infrastructureso that the availability of infrastructural facilities is commensurate with the demands of theeconomy. Increased public sector savings have been assumed on the expectation of improvedprofitability of State Electricity Boards (SEBs), and other public sector enterprises, which wouldthen facilitate increased public investment.The Tenth Plan  has observed that  the on-going disinvestments and privatisation processhas constrained the ability and willingness of the central PSUs to undertake investment activities.In view of the lack of sufficient alternative institutions through which public investment can bemade especially in the infrastructure sectors, the institutional capacity of state governments maybe utilised for infrastructure investment by the centre. The Tenth Plan has envisaged not only theuse of financial resources but also food stocks for augmenting investment in rural infrastructure.The Tenth  Plan has cautioned that unless the availability of equity and long-term debt to theprivate sector is enhanced substantially, the likelihood of adequate private investment ininfrastructure appears to be remote.4In contrast to the actual investment performance in infrastructure, in the policy spherethere has been an active and continuous attempt at bringing about reforms in the infrastructuresector. The government is slowly moving away from its traditional role as a `provider’ ofservices to one of `facilitator’ by ensuring that infrastructure services are actually delivered in adesirable manner.  While liberalizing the rules and procedures, it is attempting to create  anenvironment conducive for private participation including foreign investment in theinfrastructure sector.The power sector was the first among the infrastructure sectors to be opened up forprivate participation and yet it is in this sector that the greatest difficulty has been encountered.Private investment in the power sector has been substantially short of expectations. The basicstrategy was to invite private participation in the generation segment with independent powerprojects (IPPs) expected to sell the power to the SEBs. The reluctance of state governments totackle the basic issues of power theft and inadequate tariffs that have led to the bankruptcy ofSEBs has, however, prevented financial closure of independent power projects.  The attempt hasbeen to bypass these basic problems through stratagems like escrow arrangements and centralgovernment guarantees, which have not worked. Besides, the protracted acrimoniousnegotiations over the Dabhol power project in Maharashtra have highlighted the political risksthat  IPPs are fraught with, and are sufficient to put off any new investment in generation.Notwithstanding the problems in the power sector, there have been success stories too,especially in roads, ports and telecom. The quality of highways will improve substantially in thecoming years. The government has made rapid progress in the implementation of the NationalHighway Development Project (NHDP). There have been some efficiency gains in ports throughthe privatisation of ports’ services and berths. The telecom sector has perhaps seen the mostsignificant development. Greater clarity in regulatory and policy environments has acceleratedactivities and expanded coverage in the telecom sector.  Several private operators are already inthe market raising funds through bond financing. Tariffs in the telecom sector have comehurtling down thanks to deregulation, competition and technology. In no sector of the economyhave prices come down so fast as in the telecom sector.Clearly, the need of the hour is to renew the focus on the relatively lagging sectors, viz.,power, railways and urban infrastructure. Here, the guiding principle has to be establishment ofadequate user charges, direct or through cess, which has been the key to success for the betterperforming sectors. It is in this context, the following section presents a detailed sectoral reviewcovering roads, telecom, ports, power, railways and urban infrastructure coupled with an agendafor future policy initiatives.III. SECTORAL REVIEWRoadsThe National Highway Development Project (NHDP) consists of two major components:The "Golden Quadrilateral" and the "North South - East West" projects. "The GoldenQuadrilateral" project will connect the four major metropolitan cities with 4-6 lane highways,5with a total length of about 5,850 km. The "North South - East West" project will connect theNorthern most point of the country to the Southern most, and similarly from East to West, with atotal length of about 7,300 kmThe NHDP expected to cost Rs 540 billion, was started in 1998. The financing pattern ofthis project indicates that private sector participation in the form of investment amounts to onlyRs 40 billion (7.4 per cent of the total). Over the course of the project, institutions like the WorldBank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)are expected to finance about Rs 200 billion; another Rs 200 billion of investment would befinanced from the cess. An extra budgetary infusion of funds in the form of market borrowings isexpected to be around Rs. 100 billion for NHDP Phase I, out of which National HighwayAuthority of India (NHAI) has already borrowed about Rs 85 billion up to November 2002. Sofar, NHAI has also tied up loans amounting to Rs 80 billion from World Bank, ADB and JBICfor NHDP Phase I.This project is progressing well. Approximately 1,300 km of the "Golden Quadrilateral"have already been four laned. Similarly, on the North-South and East-West corridors, 560 kmlength has been four-laned. The announced completion date for the Golden Quadrilateral Projectof December 2003, has now been postponed to December 2004, which actually was the originaltarget date that had earlier been advanced. The North South - East West corridors are expected tobe completed by 2007-2009.Notwithstanding the efforts made over the years at state and central levels throughdifferent programmes, about 35-40 per cent of villages are yet to be connected by all weatherroads. According to the information provided by the State Governments, there were still 262,000unconnected villages till January 2004. Apart from 50 per cent of the cess on diesel earmarkedfor PMGSY, additional funds are to be made available for rural roads from the additional cess ondiesel of 50 paise in the Union Budget 2003-04. Even these funds may not be adequate if all thevillages (with more than 500 popultion) are to be connected within 5-7 years. There are multipleagencies involved in implementing road projects at district and state level under PMGSY, whichneed to be streamlined for improving efficiency. Although CRF is meant to be used for thedevelopment of the total hierarchy of roads from national highways to state highways and ruralroads, the  funds available do not seem to be sufficient for the development of state/rural roads.The present condition and stage of development of state highways and major districtroads varies widely from state to state. The status of major district roads is particularlyworrisome. The main reason for this state of affairs is that the funds for the development of thissecondary system are very inadequate. The National Highways are provided with reasonablefunds for their development at the Central level while the rural roads receive the lion’s share atthe State level.  In the process, the secondary system of roads is neglected. In future, the fundflow from the CRF for the state roads can be enhanced. Several state governments likeMaharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have initiated steps to involve the private sector in thedevelopment of state road sector. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have set upRoad Development Corporations that have issued bonds for financing of road projects.6Investment in roads has been done substantially by the public sector in all countries.Private sector investment has been naturally confined to that in limited access toll highways.Even in this segment, private investment has been at the margin. However, there was a greatdegree of optimism with respect to private investment in highways in the early 1990s, with largeprivate projects having been undertaken by countries such as Mexico, Indonesia and China.Unfortunately, the financial difficulties encountered in both Mexico and Indonesia have furtherdiscouraged private investment in roads.The risks involved in road investment are characteristically high, and involveGovernmental action at almost every step. Limited access toll highways typically involve largescale land acquisition programmes that are subject to unforeseen delays and, often, protractedlitigation by those affected. This indeed seems to be the case in Bihar, U.P. and Orissa in theimplementation of the NHDP.  Rehabilitation and environmental concerns add further to the pre-project construction risk and unexpected delays. Post construction, traffic risk is typically high.Hence, ex ante risk perception on road investment is naturally high among private investors.Such investors, therefore, demand relatively high ex-ante return to equity. Given that thecapacity of a new highway has to be designed to be adequate for some date in the future, say 10years, overcapacity is built-in for the initial years. The return from economically and rationallypriced tolls are, therefore, unlikely to produce profits in the initial years of the operation of ahighway. Economic returns, therefore, come only over a long period of time; later profitscompensating losses in initial years. These characteristics, therefore, deter private investments.In view of these considerations, considerable discussion has taken place on how best toinduce the private sector to invest in highways. There has also been the added concern over thelevel at which tolls can be levied in India, in view of the widespread reluctance to pay usercharges. The Government has to engage in considerable risk mitigation to take care of all therelevant concerns of private investors. On the financing side, it is clear that any economic tollsthat provide adequate return to private investment in highways would be too high in the Indiancontext. Hence, it is inescapable that leveraging private investment would involve the provisionof some level of subsidy from the Government.The initial discussion on this issue had suggested that the best way to provide such asubsidy would be to fix the level of toll considered feasible, and then to award a highway projecton the basis of the lowest bid for subsidy from prospective investors. Clearly, in such a system,the level of subsidy bid would vary inversely with the level of traffic and public resources wouldbe put to best use in leveraging the maximum level of private investment. Such a system wouldhave the added advantage that heavily travelled  segments would presumably be built first –thereby leading to economic efficiency in overall resource allocation. The subsidy could, ofcourse, be given ex ante as a lump sum to finance construction, or as an annuity to finance theservicing of capital.With the adequate availability of funds from the fuel cess and the enthusiasm ofmultilateral agencies to fund these projects, such a scheme for leveraging private investment inroads has not found favour, and an opportunity to leverage substantial private funds for roadconstruction has been lost. Instead, a fully funded annuity scheme has been put into effect. Underthis method, the developer is paid an annuity by the NHAI to cover the full costs over the7concession period, after certification by an independent consultant on the quality of services tothe road users. In view of the much lower risks involved in this arrangement – the investor is notsubject to any traffic risk  - there has been a relatively healthy response from the private sectorin these projects. The only risk involved is miscalculation on the magnitudes of the annuity.Until now, 8 annuity projects have been awarded, covering about 476 kilometres in the NHDP.In the 2003-04 Budget Speech, the Finance Minister announced a viability gap fundingmechanism to attract Rs 600 billion in the infrastructure sector through public-privatepartnerships. Under the new scheme, for BOT projects in the road sector, the government willprovide a subsidy in the form of an annuity flow to meet the shortfall between anticipatedrevenue and loan repayment obligations.  The shortfall may arise out of various types of riskinvolved in the project. Armed with Government’s guarantees to bridge any revenue shortfall,the executing companies will find it easier to tie up with financial institutions to raise resources.This is another opportunity to leverage private sector investment in highways through the kind ofprocess described earlier. However, some important issues about the competent authority todetermine the level of annual subsidy, and prudent and reasonable loan repayment obligations onthe part of developer are yet to be cleared for actual implementation. This subsidy is likely tohave an adverse fiscal impact. Further, there is an urgent need for a proper unbundling of risksand their assignment to the participants best able to manage them to minimize the cost of riskmanagement. Control of National Highways (Land and Traffic) Bill 2002 has been passed toprevent unauthorized occupation of national highway land and control access points to nationalhighways and control traffic on them.  As the road sector is facing considerable funds constraint,especially in view of massive expansion, maintenance and upgradation requirements, privatesector participation in road building activities has to be encouraged through well structuredO&M contracts and by a combination of construction and maintenance contracts. The futureplans of NHAI include an ambitious tolling programme, which is going to be a huge challenge inview of user resistance, traffic leakages and lower than expected traffic as witnessed in case of afew projects.TelecommunicationsThe substantial progress made in telecommunications since the early 1990s is a successstory. The number of telephone lines has grown by 25-30 per cent each year throughout the1990s. The number of telephone lines were only about 5 million in 1991 which doubled to about10 million by 1995. The India Infrastructure Report provided a range of demand projectionsbetween about 30 million and 45 million, with 35-36 million being the mean projection for 2002-03. The cellular mobile demand was projected to be between 3.5 million and 11 million by 2003.Interestingly, the licence fee parity demand for mobile phones was projected to be 8.9 million for2003. The actual achievement has been within the range of projections, with basic service lineshaving reached 41 million and cellular mobile connections 12.6 million by the end of March2003 (Table 5). Private sector investment required for achieving this kind of growth wasestimated to be about Rs 500 billion (at 1995-96 prices) between 1997 and 2002. The estimatesfor actual private sector investment during this period range between Rs 380 billion (in currentprices) and Rs 450 billion, with about a quarter coming from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).Thus, viewed from any vantage point, the growth in telecommunications must be regarded as asuccess, despite the many difficulties that have been encountered in the way, relating to frequent8policy changes, regulatory problems and tariff restructuring. This experience shows that theIndian private sector is indeed willing to take risk and invest in infrastructure provided it can seea certain degree of payment security and profitability.Reform in the telecommunications sector began in 1992-93 with the opening of valueadded services to the private sector. Subsequently, after intensive deliberation within theGovernment and outside, the National Telecom Policy (NTP 1994) announced the opening ofbasic telecom services to competition, and the initiation of cellular mobile services. Privateinitiative was to complement public sector efforts to raise additional resources through increasedinternal generation and the adoption of innovative means like leasing, deferred payments, build-operate transfer, and the like. The NTP 1994 also envisaged the provision of a public telephonebecoming available for every 500 persons in urban areas and at least one in every village. (Thereare now about 1.37 million public telephones in the country and about 600,000 village publictelephones). The method employed for inducing the private sector into both basic and cellularservices was through the auction of licence fees, consistent with what has been followed bymany other countries. The consequence was that the auction process elicited excessively highbids, even from bidders who had no previous history of substantive telecom experience, or evenany other experience. Once the licences had been awarded, and operations had begun, inevitablecomplaints arose about the licence fees being too high and uneconomic. Since variousdevelopments had taken place in the telecom sector and new issues had arisen, a New TelecomPolicy (NTP 1999) was announced. The issues that had arisen during this period related to:• Perception of the original licence fee bids having been excessive• Inadequate competition resulting from the existence of only two operators in each circle• Continuing changes in technology• The emergence of India as a significant player in the IT industryUnder the NTP 1999, a package for migration from fixed licence fee to revenue sharing•was offered in July 1999 to the existing cellular and basic service providers. The MTNL wasallowed as a third operator to provide cellular services to promote competition. Governmentopened national long-distance services to private operators without any restriction on the numberof operators and with moderate entry fees. International Long Distance Services were thenopened in 2001, also with no limit on the number of operators and moderate entry fees. Both aresubject to licence fees being paid as revenue sharing. Thus significant competition wasintroduced in the Indian telecom market starting in 2000-2001. The consequence has beendramatic: cellular mobile tariffs have fallen by about 75 per cent since 1999, and long distancetariffs, both domestic and international, fell by 60 per cent between 2000 and the end of 2002.Corresponding organisational changes also took place during 2000-01. The two serviceproviding departments of the telecom sector were corporatised, viz., Department of TelecomServices (DTS) and Department of Telecom Operations (DTO). A new public sector company'Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited' (BSNL) was given all service providing functions of these two                                                • MTNL - Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited - the government owned telephone company operating in NewDelhi and Mumbai.9departments with effect from October 2000. A fourth cellular operator in all the circles waspermitted.With the introduction of effective competition in the cellular mobile services sector, theTelecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) made cellular mobile tariffs free from regulationwhile reserving the right to intervene in the case of any malpractice such as the offer of predatorytariffs.Apart from the success of telecom policy reflected in the growth of services andsubstantial reduction in tariffs, the objective of providing rural telephones is also making goodprogress. It is estimated that, out of about 610,000 villages in the country, about 510,000 havealready been provided with at least one "Village Public Telephone" (VPT).Although the outcome of reforms in the telecom sector is reflected in the greater role ofthe private sector, higher tele-density, decreasing supply of demand gap and the availability ofservices at substantially cheaper rates, the new challenges in the telecom sector are concernedwith ongoing convergence that is taking place and the appropriate regulatory response to greatercompetition in the market. There has been excessive fragmentation in the provision of serviceson the basis of type of service, geographical coverage between service providers, and eventechnology (e.g. Cellular Mobile Services and Wireless Local Loop Limited Mobile Services).Hence, convergence of different services, broadcasting, multimedia and telecommunicationsthrough a single national service provider is being constrained. As a result of this fragmentation,none of the operators is able to build a technology base that would strengthen their bargainingpower in the international market. It is true, however, that consolidation is indeed taking placethrough mergers and acquisitions: it is quite likely that the country will end up with four or fiveprivate operators along with the public sector incumbent. A key issue for policy is how to hastenthis process through consolidation of different licences. We could then see the emergence ofsignificant Indian telecom players who could then operate on an international scale.The corporatisation of the Department of Telecommunications into BSNL and the•privatization of VSNL have been bold steps on the part of Government. It is now necessary tostrengthen both BSNL and MTNL as corporate entities. With about 40 million lines betweenthem they would probably rank among the top six to ten telecommunications entities in theworld. Government equity in MTNL is now about 55 per cent, while BSNL remains 100 per centgovernment owned. Two opposite kinds of problems are arising out of their government ownedincumbent status. First, with open entry in almost all service segments, the privileges given to theincumbents (e.g. non payment of licence fees) provide for unjust competition to the privatesector operators. On the other hand, however, their public sector status constrains them fromcompeting freely with the new operators. The recent intervention by the Government onrestraining BSNL and MTNL from adjusting their tariffs is a case in point. A key issue,therefore, relates to the further restructuring of BSNL and MTNL so that they can competeeffectively, while  they also provide fairness and transparency in operations with respect to theprivate sector. Social obligations must be met through the mechanism of Universal ServiceObligations (USO) as proposed in NTP 1999, and compensation through the USO Fund  shouldget earmarked resources from the licence fee.                                                • Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited - the hitherto government owned international log distance monopoly operator.10It has been argued that BSNL deserves preferential treatment from the Government sinceit has to bear the social obligations of providing unremunerative telephone social services in ruralareas and other far flung areas. This view has got reinforced with the failure of private operatorsin complying with their licencing conditions related to rural services. BSNL has argued for notpaying licence fees, and instead receiving additional subsidies from Government. Whereas theargument for receiving subsidies for social obligations is justified, this must be done intransparent fashion through the means of the Universal Service Obligations Fund(USO Fund)  asproposed in NTP 1999.  The USO Fund itself should be funded from earmarked resources fromthe licence fee, e.g. 5 per cent of total revenues from all operators, including BSNL. Fairnessbetween the public and private sector operators would then be established and perceived as such.Furthermore, as and when BSNL is disinvested and privatised, such a system could continue tooperate without difficulty.Efficient, credible, and authoritative functioning of the regulator is essential for thefunctioning of the telecom market. The overall functioning of the TRAI must be adjudged anunusual success: it has been effective in introducing competition in the reduction of tariffs, andin the rapid expansion of services.  However, its functioning has been subjected to a number ofcontroversies and recent events suggest that it needs to be strengthened considerably. The keyissues are:(i) The Government must eschew temptation to interfere in the decision making processof the TRAI, as a consequence of corporate or political lobbying. This erodes thecredibility of the regulator and gives rise to erosion of its authority, as seen in recentmonths.(ii) TRAI must be strengthened professionally. This will be difficult unless it is madefinancially independent and the compensation structure delinked from theGovernment, but made totally transparent.(iii) The appointment of the Authority should be more transparent and process linked sothat it does not become a sinecure for retiring civil servants. The appointment ofrespected professionals would also add to its technical strength and respect in themarket.With the increasing difficulties encountered in tariff restructuring, it is absolutelyessential that the regulator is strengthened and made more independent. The restructuring ofbasic service rentals and tariffs have been resisted politically. This is when there are only about41 million fixed lines in the country: clearly the poor do not have telephones. The politicalsensitivity of telephone tariffs will only increase in the future as teledensity expands. Tariffs willhave to be at economic levels if the telecom sector is to remain sound and not go the way of thepower sector.Ports11A common characteristic of the fast growing East and South East Asian countries hasbeen the rapid growth of trade during their high growth period. A higher share of trade in theeconomy contributes to the attainment of higher efficiency. A country improves its resourceallocation by exporting those goods where it exhibits competitive advantage and imports thosewhere it does not. As its comparative advantage changes, so does the composition of its exportsand imports. Thus, in order to achieve higher economic growth and higher efficiency levels, thetrade-GDP ratio needs to increase substantially. Improvement in the efficiency of ports andexpansion of their capacity is essential for promoting the growth of trade and exportcompetitiveness.In the wake of 20 per cent plus annual growth of exports during 1993 to 1996, the IndiaInfrastructure Report had projected annual average growth in exports of about 15 per centbetween 1995-96 and 2005-06, 20 per cent growth tapering down to 10 per cent over that 10 yearperiod. Thus, exports were projected to increase from a level of about 10 per cent of GDP in1995-96 to about 17 per cent in 2002-03 (about US$87 billion) and 18 per cent by 2005-06.Correspondingly, imports were expected to increase from a level of about 11-12 per cent in1995-96 to about 18 per cent of GDP in 2002-03 and 19 per cent in 2005-06.  Total trade as aproportion of GDP was expected to have reached 35 per cent by now. The projections for porttraffic had been made based on these trade projections. Thus, total port traffic was expected toincrease from a level of around 215 million tonnes in 1995-96 to 480 million tonnes by 2002-03and 650 million tonnes by 2005-06. In fact, growth in trade has been much slower, reaching alevel of about 22 per cent of GDP in 2002-03: exports at 10 per cent and imports at 12 per cent.Thus total port traffic in 2002-03 is recorded at only 313 million tones. It is partly because of thisrelatively slow growth in trade in goods that ports have not been a constraint in the late 1990s.Port functioning has actually improved quite significantly, and there has been noshortage of needed investment by both the private and public sectors. Cargo handled by majorports has steadily increased albeit modestly to 313 million tones (MT) in 2002-03 from 215 MTin 1995-96 (Table 6). The Ninth Five Year Plan had only targetted traffic at 289 MT in theterminal year, i.e. 2001-02 as against the anticipated capacity of 344 MT. Thus, port capacity isno longer a constraint. During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1997-2002), 17 private sector/captiveport projects of 60 MT capacity with an investment of about Rs 35 billion have been approvedand are at different stages of construction. The Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-07) visualizes 6 percent annual growth in traffic, a traffic load of 415 MT in the terminal year and a total capacity of470 MT at the major ports, contributed, among others, by improvement in productivity to theextent of 15 MT. There has been an improvement in the principal indicators of port efficiency atthe major ports. The average pre-berthing waiting time has come down from 1.7 days in 1996-97to 0.50 days in 2001-02. The average turnaround time has declined from 7.5 days in 1996-97 to4.1 days in 2000-01 and further to 3.7 days in 2001-02. The output per ship berth day hasincreased from 4,497 tonnes in 1996-97 to 6,701 tonnes in 2000-01 and further to 6,972 tonnesin 2001-02. Labour productivity has also increased from 307 tonnes in 1997-98 to 413 tonnes in2000-01 in terms of output per gang shift. Productivity indicators have, however, varied widelyacross the ports. This suggests that there could be institutional innovations as have occurred atbetter performing ports such as the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT in New Mumbai), whichmay be adopted in other ports.12The Government has laid down guidelines for private sector participation in the areas ofleasing out of assets, construction and operation of terminals, berths, warehousing, tank farms,container freight stations, and captive power plants; pilotage and captive facilities for port basedindustries. 100 per cent FDI in ports has been allowed in December 1998 through the automaticapproval route under the Reserve Bank of India. Guidelines on joint venture in major ports havebeen issued in September 2000. Model bid documents including license agreement have beenfinalised to attract private sector investment and participation. The norms for private BOTprojects in major ports have been relaxed in 2001-02, in the context of limited privateparticipation in major ports. So far, 41 private sector projects involving a capacity addition ofabout 160 MT and investment of about Rs 108 billion are at various stages of evaluation andimplementation, out of which seven projects with capacity addition of 28 MT and investment ofRs 18.5 billion have already been completed. Private sector participation in major ports has beenmainly under licensing of operations of existing container berths or granting Build Own OperateTransfer (BOOT) concessions for increasing terminal capacity. Thus, there is no shortage ofprivate sector willingness to invest in the port sector. Higher trade growth is quite likely to elicitgreater private sector response.International trade is witnessing an increasing trend in containerisation. Accordingly,container traffic at major ports has shown impressive growth of over 10 per cent during the lastthree years. At present, about 70 per cent of the containers, which flow through India are trans-shipped through ports of Colombo, Singapore, Dubai and Salalah, leading to increased delay andcost in trade and transactions. It is, therefore, necessary to develop a hub port each on the eastand west coasts of the country. Already, an international container trans-shipment terminal atVallarpadam, Cochin is proposed to be developed.Even though the major ports continue to handle about 75 per cent of the port traffic in thecountry, state ports are increasingly exhibiting higher traffic growth than the major ports. Duringthe Ninth Plan (1997-02) when the overall traffic growth was 8.5 per cent, it has grown at 27.9per cent for state ports and at 4.9 per cent for major ports. Besides, there is a need for alternativesto the congested major ports, particularly in the context of development of coastal shipping.There is great potential for private investment for the development of minor/ intermediate ports.Gujarat is by far the most active state in attracting private participation. Andhra Pradesh, TamilNadu and Orissa have also invited private participation to develop minor ports by offering long-term leases. The state governments and the Union Ministry of Surface Transport have set up theMaritime States Development Council for formulating an integrated ports policy including minorports.As the Government changed policy to permit private investment in ports, it becamenecessary to set up a mechanism for setting tariffs on a transparent and fair basis. With all majorports being in the public sector and structured as port trusts, tariffs were earlier proposed by PortTrusts and approved by the Ministry of Surface Transport. Accordingly, the Tariff Authority forMajor Ports (TAMP) was set up in 1997. The TAMP has generally worked on cost plusprinciples, but has done so on a transparent and consultative basis. It initiated a system oftransparent consultation with all stakeholders before approving or setting any tariff.13Tariffs had earlier been set on an entirely ad hoc basis by each Port Trust with littlerationale or uniformity in approach. TAMP has attempted to work on broad principles of costplus, but moderated by a normative approach allowing port trusts a certain return to capital. Italso aimed to get a broad comparability in approach across ports, which was then applied equallyto the new private port operators.With the achievement of some initial rationalisation, TAMP now needs to focus morepro-actively on promoting competitive tariffs: users of cargo services should not end up payingfor port or labour inefficiencies. Tariff policy should now be used as leverage to prescribestandards of service, thus contributing to productivity and efficiency. Competition between portsshould also be encouraged through flexibility in pricing. Tariff policy can also be used  forrationing port capacity, with high tariffs in ports that are congested. However, this cannot betaken too far since the on land transportation facilities vary tremendously between ports.With the movement towards corporatisation of ports, and increasing weight of minorports in total cargo throughput, the restriction of TAMP's jurisdiction to major ports only willprogressively reduce its effectiveness. In fact, since TAMP was formed through an amendmentto the Major Port Trusts Act, its jurisdiction is restricted to major port trusts. Ironically, as majorport trusts get corporatised they, will go out of TAMP's jurisdiction, thus defeating the originalpurpose of TAMP providing a level tariff playing field between port trust operations and newerprivate operators.  Thus, further thought needs to be given to the functioning of TAMP. It shouldhave jurisdiction over all ports over some stipulated size, but its pricing strategy needs to bemuch more flexible to promote competition and have lower prices.So far, Indian port tariffs are generally higher than other ports, and their efficiency alsocompares poorly, despite the improvements cited, with the world's major ports including those inthe region, such as Colombo, Shanghai and Singapore. If Indian trade is to expand substantiallyin the future, substantial new investment will be required along with modernisation of existingfacilities. This will need significant organisational restructuring of existing port trusts, includingthat traditional, restrictive, labour practices. Fortunately, the tariff structure is such that portinvestment can be extremely lucrative, even as efficiency increases and port tariffs come down.The existing port trusts being constrained by their structure are unable to compete withthe private operators and minor ports. Although the port trusts are being encouraged to convertthemselves into limited companies, corporatisation with continuing government ownership andcontrol may not be of much help without the design of appropriate governance structures for thenew corporatised entities. The existing port trust structure does give voice to other stake holdersand local governments through membership of the Trusts. Thus, a good degree of consultationwill be needed for the transition. It would perhaps be desirable for the port trusts or theirsuccessors to turn into a landlord port structure where each terminal may be hived off as aseparate company and competitively bid, with or without the port authority being a joint venturepartner to boost intra-port competition. These terminal companies could compete and investacross diverse ports so as to mitigate risks out of a single base. Besides, they should be exposedto competition in raising funds from the capital market and to competition for managementcontrol. In order to enhance inter-port competition, port connectivity needs to be improved withinter-modal co-ordination between Railways, Container Corporation of India(CONCOR),14Central Water Commission(CWC) and National Highway Authority of India(NHAI). Forsustaining competition, both inter-port and intra-port, the key regulatory issues such as disputeresolution mechanism, entry of new players, issue of concession, and merger/de-merger in theports sector need to be clearly enunciated. In ports where private investment has taken placethrough container terminals such as in Nhava Sheva and Chennai, conflicts of interest havearisen with the host Port Trusts performing the role of land lords as well as operatingcompetitors. In order to aid this process, TAMP could perhaps be turned into an overall portregulator rather than being restricted to just tariff determination and approval.PowerThe power sector was the first among infrastructure sectors to be opened for privatesector investment. As economic reforms were initiated in 1991 and significantly higher growthexpected as a result, it was clear that public sector resources would not be adequate for the kindof investment required in the power sector. Internationally, and particularly in East and SouthEast Asia, the world as a whole had discovered the idea of independent power projects (IPPs) forgeneration and sale of power to the existing grids.  Consequently, large plans were drawn up forattracting investments in independent power projects from both domestic and internationalinvestors.The installed capacity at the beginning of the Eighth Five Year Plan (1992) was about69,075 MW. This increased by about 16,500 MW during the Eighth Plan as compared with theplanned addition of about 30,000 MW. The India Infrastructure Report had projected a capacityaddition of about 33,000 MW between 1996 and 2001, and 50,000 MW between 2001 and 2006,along with significant improvements in efficiency to improve further utilization of existingcapacity.  Correspondingly, the Ninth Five Year Plan projected an addition of  40,000 MWbetween 1997 and 2002 and the Tenth Plan projects another 41,000 MW between 2002 and2007. The actual achievement was an addition of about 16,500 mw during 1992 to 1997 andabout 19,000 MW during 1997 to 2002 (See Table 7).  With this poor achievement, there wouldhave been a severe shortage of power had it not been for the slowdown in both industrial andagricultural growth in the last five years, and the significant improvement in the plant load factorfrom 57 per cent in 1992-93 to almost 70 per cent in 2001-2002.In view of the poor financial condition of State Electricity Boards caused both byinefficiency and low agricultural and domestic tariffs, the original idea was to provide paymentsecurity to private investors through government guarantees and escrow arrangements providingthem priority in payments. It was expected that these would be temporary measures as the StateElectricity Boards would improve their functioning and become able to pay Independent PowerProducers(IPPs) adequately. These arrangements were done in the context of rather generousassumptions about return to equity embedded in the power purchase agreements ( PPAs).Consequently, there was enthusiastic response from both international and domestic investors.The aftermath of this exuberance is too well known to be repeated here: suffice it to say that theprogramme was replete with errors on all sides. The consequence is that the expectation ofprivate sector  investment in generation has been scaled down considerably for the Tenth FiveYear Plan (Table 7).15The reluctance of State Governments to tackle the basic issues of power theft andinadequate tariffs has led to the bankruptcy of SEBs, which has then made it impossible forviable private investment to take place in the power sector.It is now well recognized that the financial difficulties of the State Electricity Boards(SEBs) lie at the heart of the power sector problems. The financial position of all the SEBs hasdeteriorated rapidly during the 1990s. Barring the SEBs in Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra,all other SEBs have recorded losses between 1992-93 and 2001-02 ranging from Rs 40 million toRs 37 billion. During 2001-02 alone, the commercial loss (excluding subsidy) was of the order ofRs 240 billion according to Planning Commission estimates.  Such huge losses have adverselyaffected the ability of SEBs to supply electricity reliably, leading to default in payments to thepower generation/transmission PSUs.The root of the problem lies in the gap between user charges and cost of supply. Despite agraduated hike in user charges, the gap between cost of supply and average tariff per unit ofelectricity produced has actually worsened from a level of 23 paise in 1992-93 to about 110 paisein 2001-02 (Table 8). Revenues dropped from 82 per cent of costs in 1992-93 to 69 per cent in2001-02. While there has been some rationalisation of tariff for the subsidised sectors, viz.,agriculture and domestic sectors, the process is obviously far from complete.What is interesting about Table 8  is that the increases in average tariffs have actuallyexceeded average inflation as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (See Table 9). Thus,tariffs have indeed increased substantially. But, the pace of increase in costs has been even faster.The gap between cost of supply and average tariff has been accentuated further owing tolosses in transmission and distribution (T&D), which correspond to electricity produced but notpaid for. T&D losses of SEBs rose from 24.8 per cent in 1997-98 to 26.5 per cent in 1998-99 andfurther to 30.9 per cent in 1999-00. T&D losses are caused by a variety of factors such aselectricity sold at low voltage, sparsely distributed loads across large rural areas, inadequateinvestments in distribution, improper billing and outright theft.The poor financial health of SEBs and the resultant spill-over on the generating utilitiesare reflected in the subdued growth in power generation, which was at 3.1 per cent in 2001-02down from 3.9 per cent in the preceding period (Table 10). The growth in capacity addition,after a turnaround in 1997-98 has slowed down, and entered negative territory in 2000-01 and2001-02. On the other hand, plant load factor (PLF), which is a measure of operational efficiencyof thermal power plants has indicated a steady improvement from 57 per cent in 1992-93 toabout 70 per cent in 2001-02. This is witnessed in all the regions excepting the North Easternregion. The demand-supply attained a peak of 11.5 per cent of demand in 1996-97, declined to5.9 per cent in 1998-99, but increased again to 7.7 per cent in 2002-02.Power ReformsPower sector reforms were initiated in 1991, encouraging competition in each subelement of the sector, viz., generation, transmission and distribution. The Central ElectricityRegulatory Commission (CERC) was set up at the national level in 1997 and State Electricity16Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) have now been set up in 22 states, 13 of which have issuedtariff orders so far. Private participation in power transmission has been allowed with theenactment of the Electricity Laws (Amendment) Act in 1998. The Indian Electricity Grid Codehas been established in January 2000 by the CERC to ensure grid discipline for individualplayers in the T&D sector. The Availability Based Tariff order of January 2000 by the CERC isexpected to encourage reliability and efficiency in generation.The Electricity Bill, originally drafted in 2001 has recently been passed by the Parliamentin 2003. It would replace the existing three laws on electricity, viz., the Indian Electricity Act,1910; the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998. Itrecognises trading of power as a distinct activity and provides a legal framework for enablingreforms and restructuring of the power sector. Already, SEBs in nine states have beenunbundled/corporatised. The distribution operations in Orissa and Delhi have been privatised.The newly set up distribution companies are expected to emulate the success of private sectordistribution in Mumbai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, and ensure effective enforcement of usercharges.An Accelerated Power Development Programme (APDP) initiated in 2000-01 andsubsequently modified as Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (APDRP)with an outlay of Rs. 3,500 crore has been designed to assist reforms in the distribution sector. Itaims at 100 per cent metering, energy audit, replacement of distribution transformers, and ITsolutions relating to power flow at critical points to ensure accountability at all levels. TheAPDRP also provides for financial incentive to the states to reduce the gap between unit cost ofsupply and revenue realisation. The Ministry of Power has already signed memorundum ofunderstanding (MoU) with 25 states to undertake reforms in a time bound manner.On the issue of outstanding SEB dues to Central PSUs and dues from Central PSUs toState Power Utilities, the Ahluwalia Expert Group constituted by the Ministry of Power in 2001,designed a securitisation scheme for one-time settlement of the approximately Rs 420 billionpayable by SEBs to  Central Government Public Sector Units(PSUs) as on September 30, 2001after writing off Rs 96 billion. Towards this end, a tripartite agreement has been signed recentlyin March 2003 between the Ministry of Power, State Governments and the Reserve Bank ofIndia. In accordance with the agreement, defaults in current payment would attract a gradedreduction in supply of power from Central power stations.The one time settlement of SEB dues needs to be strengthened with the right pricing ofpower. Once the SEBs’ capacity to pay is enhanced in a durable manner, investment in powergeneration or transmission with active private participation is expected to take off. The passageof the Electricity Act, 2003 has now created an enabling environment towards a competitivepower sector. However, a great deal of work remains to be done particularly at the state level.The reform template recently put forward by the Ministry of Power’s Expert Committee on StateSpecific Reforms could be helpful in making further progress.The last ten years have been intensive in discussions related to power sector reforms. Thepolicy framework is now in place to actually implement them. The key issue is the curbing of17theft and the restructuring tariffs. The increase in tariffs that has taken place already is indicativeof  the willingness of consumers to pay, provided they get reliable power supply. The accent nowhas to be on a countrywide campaign across all States, regardless of parties  in power toeliminate power theft. Such theft is clearly not being done by the poor, since consumption ofelectricity requires the ownership of items that consume electricity.  If there is not a transperant demonstration of the curbing of power theft, it will be difficult to increase power tariffs muchfurther. The industrial tariffs are already too high in comparison to both international standardsand local costs.RailwaysIndian Railways (IR) have been the prime movers to the nation and have the distinctionof being the second largest railway system in the world under single management. IR hashistorically played an important integrating role in the socio-economic development of thecountry. Its role in economic development assumes importance due to its innate advantage as amode of surface transport being more energy efficient and environment friendly than othertransport modes.However, IR has run into severe financial difficulties in the 1990s, which has hamperedits growth and cast severe doubt on its ability to provide competitive transport services in thefuture.  If the growth of the Indian economy accelerates, the supply of all transportation serviceswould have to accelerate correspondingly.  With an open economy and an increasinglycompetitive world environment, transportation will also have to be increasingly competitive interms of both cost and quality of services.  India being a large continental economy, with a largeproportion of its activities located inland, the role of Indian Railways in providing suchcompetitive services will be a critical part of the solution to India’s infrastructure needs.As in the case of power, a tradition has been built up to see railways as part of essentialpublic service, the usage of which should not be denied even to those unable to pay.Correspondingly, freight users have been seen as those classes of users who could easily pay,and more. Consequently, freight services subsidise   passenger services as a whole, and upperclass passengers subsidise others. This was a viable system in the context of a closed economy,since higher goods freight charges could merely be passed on to the ever suffering consumer.Moreover, since the freight user was predominantly the public sector operating in anadministered price system (oil, steel, coal, foodgrains), this caused no marketing problems forthe railways. This is no longer sustainable in the open economy.With the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission award, the financial difficulties ofthe Railways got accentuated in the late 1990s. For the first time in 17 years, in 2000-01, IR wasnot able to pay its dividend to the Government, and this continued in 2001-02. A commercialenterprise in such a situation would have been declared in default, and would have had to go forrestructuring.Competition has been increasing across all sectors of the economy and the transportationbusiness is no different. After trucking was deregulated in the 1980s, road transportation has18grown rapidly and has impacted Railways’ market share significantly. Features like greatercustomer orientation, flexibility and lower cost of short leads are increasing the share ofroadways even in bulk commodities that have been the traditional stronghold of the Railways.Over the last decade, the proportion of the total production of bulk commodities that wastransported by rail has gone down in almost all commodities.  The annual growth rate of freightcarried by IR (in  net tonne kilometres) averaged 5.33 per cent between 1984 and 1991, butdropped to 1.86 per cent in the next seven years 1992-99. Road dominance is likely to increasefurther with the completion of the Golden Quadrilateral in the National Highway DevelopmentProject; and the increasing use of pipelines for transportation of POL products.The loss of market share in the profitable freight business, lack of flexibility in pricing,high cost of internally sourced products and services, together with investments inunremunerative projects, have meant that the rate of growth in revenues has been outstripped bythe rate of increase in costs.  Investment in unremunerative projects escalated during the 1990s.First, the adoption of the uniguage project involving large investments during this period hasbeen particularly harmful to the finances of IR.  Second, the temptation to begin a myriad of newlines for political reasons has been much greater in the politically fractured 1990s, and continuesto this day. Revenue growth has also suffered from the saturation of freight traffic on trunkroutes, particularly the golden quadrilateral. This is partly due to the large differential in spreadbetween passenger and freight trains, which constrains severely the freight carrying capacity oftrunk routes. Timely investment in new technology, track upgradation and signaling could haveeased this constraint.The proportion of expenditure on repairs and maintenance has been declining over theyears, and adequate investment has not been made in track renewals and other safety relatedareas. Consequently, the arrears of track renewals have grown from about 3,500 km to about13,000 km over the last 10-11 years. To arrest the steep decline in its share, and to improve thequality of its services, the IR needs to increase investments in infrastructure substantively.However, if the existing trends in cost increases, uneconomical tariff setting, and investments inunremunerative projects were to continue, it would be impossible for IR to find the funds forsuch investments and to service them.In recognition of these problems, IR appointed an Expert Group on Indian Railways in1999, which submitted its Report on July 2001. The Expert Group concluded that:"If IR is to survive as an ongoing transportation organisation, it has to modernizeand expand its capacity to serve the emerging needs of a growing economy. Thiswill require substantial investment on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.With the prospect of getting substantial free or subsidised resources from thegovernment being unlikely, new investment will have to be financed on acommercial basis. This is the challenge facing Indian Railways".The ability of the Indian Railways to accelerate the growth rate of their revenues fromfreight and passenger traffic is central to the success of any effort to restructure the organisationand to finance the necessary investments.19With these objectives in mind, the Expert Group recommended a multi-track strategy :(i) Tariff Rebalancing: In order to correct the imbalance between freight and passengertraffic, both tariffs have to be rebalanced. Any further increase in freight tariffs wouldlead to loss of freight share. Within passenger tariffs, the ratio of lower classes faresto highest AC I class fares would have to be corrected from the existing high ratio ofabout 1:14 to about 1:9, as was also recommended in 1993 by the Railway Freightand Fares Committee.  This could be done over a period of about 5 years.(ii) A Major Investment Programme: Expansion of revenue will involve a significantincrease in traffic - both freight and passenger - to about 7 - 7.5 per cent per year.Achievement of such growth will involve all round modernization, introduction ofhigh speed modern passenger services, commodity specific freight strategies, andintroduction of new technology, particularly in signaling and communications.(iii) Organisational Restructuring and Corporatisation: Such tariff rebalancing, trafficgrowth, and a strategic investment programme cannot  be done in a "Business-as-Usual" basis. Thus IR has to be reorganized to a corporate framework from its currentdepartmental form of organisation. This would be essential to achieve the kind ofcommercial and customer orientation needed to achieve the goals outlined.  Suchlarge restructuring would be a very complex task and would have to be done carefullyover a 5-7 year period. A beginning would be made with the recasting of accounts ina corporate framework in order to enable accountability and commercialisation of IR.(iv) Separation of Functions : In line with developments in other infrastructure sectors, itwould be desirable to separate policy setting, regulatory and operational functions.The Government should obviously be responsible for policy making; an IndianRailways Regulatory Authority could be in charge of regulation, including tariffs; andthe corporatised Indian Railways Corporation  would be responsible for allcommercial operations.The Expert Group argued that the financial situation of IR is currently such that anythingshort of a bold programme would not rescue IR from its current financial straits.The response of IR and the Government to the Report of the Expert Group has been lessthan lukewarm. Some tariff rebalancing has indeed been done. It is possible that suchrebalancing might continue; particularly due to market pressures. It is becoming difficult toincrease upper class fares because of emerging competition from airlines. Second, modernizationof the Golden  Quadrilateral is being taken up in right earnest with assistance from both theAsian Development Bank and the World Bank. However, it is not yet clear how the wholeproject will be financed and how these finances will ultimately be serviced. On theorganisational side, there has been no response at all. The prognosis for Indian Railways beingable to perform its functions efficiently in the future is not positive.Urban Infrastructure20The attainment of high growth requires well functioning and efficient cities. India nowhas 27 million plus cities, and 400 plus cities with population greater than 100,000. As growthproceeds apace, we can expect urbanisation to accelerate along with the structural changesexpected in the economy, with activities shifting away from agriculture and towards industry andservices. Efficient production of industrial goods and that of services requires agglomeration.In the other areas of infrastructure, either significant policy changes have already beenmade (telecom, roads, ports) to improve performance, or the policy changes necessary are knownbut are proving difficult to implement (power and railways). In the case of urban infrastructure,there is little understanding of what needs to be done and how. Part of the problem is intrinsic.The implementation of urban infrastructure programmes lies with city level agencies or somestate agencies, but these are typically bereft of resources and technical competence. A great dealof policy level discussion takes place at the national level, but the Central Government has fewpolicy instruments to use to steer urban infrastructure in any particular direction. The CentralGovernment has initiated a number of centrally sponsored schemes but resources allocated tothese schemes are essentially token in nature.As in the case of other infrastructure, urban infrastructure investment suffers from thelack of resources resulting from inadequate municipal finances and low user charges. With thestate of Central and State finances being what it is, precious little can be done by way ofdownward devolution. For the provision of public goods, there is little alternative to thegeneration of local resources through local taxes, in particular property taxes, which should bebuoyant in the face of rapid urbanisation and an incipient housing boom. Because of inefficientand antiquated property tax systems, many cities have relied on octroi taxes, a tax that hasalways been at the top of the list of rank bad taxes. Similarly, user charges for water supply,sewage, solid waste disposal, etc. are kept low in the name of the poor, thereby starving theseservices of the investment that is surely required. Correction of this situation needs a few cityleaders (political or bureaucratic) who can change the situation through resource generation andassociated improvement in the delivery of services that is transparent to the people. Thedemonstration effect should then spread out to other cities. The legislative provision for theexercise of such leadership now exists.thThe 74 Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 has given constitutional status tomunicipal governments and has defined municipal responsibilities and entrusted theresponsibility of defining financial relations between state and local governments. In many statesthe devolution of administrative powers relating to planning, financing and managing municipalservices has not yet become effective. In order to augment resources in the urban infrastructure,100 per cent foreign direct investments (FDI) has been permitted in the development ofintegrated township since 2001. For urban infrastructure, in view of declining availability of statefinances and the Reserve Bank of India’s endeavor to bring discipline to lend against stateguarantees, the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are compelled to explore alternative sources offinancing like municipal bonds. ULBs in Ahmedbad, Bangalore, Vijayawada and Ludhiana etc.have already raised money through municipal bonds. However, there is a need to incentivise themarkets so that investment in these instruments of longer tenor can be made attractive for retailand institutional investors. The municipal bond is one of the most potent ways of raisingresources for ULBs. Norms for getting them rated have to be put in place. Investments have not21taken place because of very rigid existing problems related to land acquisition and stamp duty. Inforward looking states like Andhra Pradesh, there has been some success in terms of customeroriented and transparent delivery mechanisms. Andhra Pradesh has taken the lead role inintroducing e-Governance and has achieved considerable progress in this area. e-Seva is oneamong the major e-Governance projects rendering multiple services to the public throughintegrated citizen service centers. Initially it was covered in 16 integrated citizen service centersin the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, called TWINS or Twin Cities NetworkServices pilot project. Now the e-Seva project covers the entire Andhra Pradesh providing 19citizen services across the same counter. These services include information, all payments togovernment departments/agencies, submission of forms, tax returns, certificates/licenses,reservation of travels tickets etc. E-governance systems like TWINS and E-Seva in AndhraPradesh are needed to be adopted by other states too.In the area of water supply, municipalities, state governments and water boards haveinitially shown considerable interest in attracting the private sector for funding, constructing,operating and maintaining facilities such as bulk water treatment plants. However, severalprojects were subsequently abandoned in Hyderabad, Cochin and Pune due to various potentialobstacles. Water supply and solid waste collection & disposal system need a shift from‘Government Only’ approach to provide better services in the cities.  Urban areas presently facesevere concerns emerging from the gap between demand and supply of urban services due toadequate finance and ineffective governance that has impinged on the productivity of urbanareas. The participation of the private sector to meet rising financial requirements for waterprojects is constrained, as this sector is fraught with risks. Since user charges do not coverservices costs the colossal subsidy component has compelled various ULBs to borrow massively.There is no regulatory authority for the water sector that could make private projects morebankable.The World Bank and UNDP have recently conducted careful studies on the cost of urbanwater in India and the tariffs charged. It has been found that all water consumers receive largesubsidies at present. Whereas the average cost of water works out to be about Rs.15 per cubicmetre, the average tariff is about Rs.1.50 per cubic metre. Even industrial and commercial tariffsare found to be significantly below cost. Since better off customers, industrial, commercial anddomestic, typically consume larger volumes of water, they end up receiving larger effectivesubsidies than the poor who consume much less water. Yet, the prevailing view is that watercannot be priced at rational economic levels because of the law affordability of the poor.In the urban infrastructure sector, urban local bodies (ULBs) which provide services areautonomous in theory but are still guided by an extensive set of government regulations. Thepoor financial position of ULBs is the main constraint on the growth of urban infrastructure.There is also considerable political interference in operations, managerial decision making andtariff setting. Tariff fixation should be based on average incremental cost including operation andmaintenance charges, depreciation charges, debt dues etc. The current institutional arrangementsdo not create the proper structures and incentives for improvement of operational efficiency andquality of service. Problems relating to inadequate information about current financial andphysical condition of the existing service provider and assets, tariffs well below cost recovery22levels etc are the issues for the international water operators trying to identify opportunities inmedium size towns in India.For the provision of urban infrastructure, ULBs particularly small ones are without thewherewithal to access the capital market to raise resources at competitive rates. These lackinstitutional capacity to manage the complexities and tasks involved in operating infrastructureservices. For them urban housing and development corporations and insurance companies havebeen the main source of funds which provide funds at a higher rate. The problem getsaccentuated when ULBs are unable to levy adequate user charges to service the debt and theprojects are too small to be financed through debt/equity etc. Such identified small projects canbe financed jointly as has been the practice of multi-project financing adopted in East Europeancountries by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The possibility of pooledfinancing of such identified projects through floating of bonds should be explored. It can savetransaction costs as well as borrowing cost. Apart from these, sound accounting and financialmanagement practices are required to enable the municipalities to access domestic debt marketsand pay for the facilities constructed and operated by the private sector. Recently 14 ULBs inTamil Nadu pooled certain water and sanitation projects to float bonds. Currently more than 50ULBs are experimenting with various forms of arrangements to introduce private sectorparticipation in Solid Waste Management (SWM) and its transportation.IV. CONCLUSIONSInfrastructure investment used to be a staid, regular, uninteresting activity that the publicsector was involved in and which was taken for granted by most of the population. The kind ofactive discussion, experimentation and innovation that has taken place over the past decade isunprecedented in the area of infrastructure in India, and in the rest of the world. It is now timefor consolidation and actual implementation. It is inescapable that if India is to achieve the kindof economic growth rates that have now become a matter of common aspiration, infrastructuremust become even more of a priority than it has been.That the public sector financing constraint is an objective reality has been documented inthis paper. The lesson is two fold. First, all constraints to private sector investment must beloosened so that it can at least partially compensate for the lower than desirable level of publicinvestment. Second, there is no escape from raising the public sector levels of infrastructureinvestment since some infrastructure services are really public goods, whereas others exhibitpartial public good characteristics. However, it will not be feasible to restore public sectorinfrastructure investment levels to appropriate levels without fiscal improvements, particularlythrough revenue increases in both tax and non-tax areas.Rural InfrastructureThere has been a significant slowdown in agricultural growth over the past five years.Even prior to this period, trend growth had been in the region of around 3 per cent annualgrowth, although it had accelerated to 4.5-5.0 per cent during the early to mid 1990s (Table 1). IfIndia is to approach annual growth of 7-8 per cent over the next 5-10 years, it will be difficult todo so if agriculture grows at rates of 2-3 per cent annually. In the past, growth in agriculture has23been equated with that in production of foodgrains. It is now clear that, with rising incomes allround, the average Indian diet in both rural and urban areas is becoming increasingly diversified.Consequently, expenditure on foodgrains is falling as a proportion of total household foodexpenditure. Growth in domestic demand for foodgrains is, therefore, unlikely to sustain growthin production greater than what has been achieved in the past. Higher agricultural growth willnow have to come from a much more diversified agriculture as has been the experience in otherfast growing Asian countries.Agricultural diversification and accelerated agricultural growth will be difficult toachieve without much greater investment in rural infrastructure such as roads, storage facilities,telecommunications, power, and the like. Diversified agriculture will need much more complexcommercial linkages between the farm and market. Thus, rural infrastructure investment willyield high economic returns, but it is difficult to develop any methodology to yield adequatefinancial returns. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa that invested inrural roads relatively early have demonstrated how essential it is to do so.A key challenge for India in the coming years will be the investment in and financing ofrural infrastructure. Given the difficult fiscal situation already alluded to, innovation will have tobe the order of the day. New approaches to public private partnerships, participation of localgovernments, funds sourced from dedicated levies such as the fuel cess will all have to beexplored. It will also have to be understood politically that continuation of tariff policies such asthe low rural electricity tariffs will not contribute to the rapid development of rural infrastructure.RegulationIncreases in private sector investments can take place on both exclusive and partnershipbasis. In sectors such as telecom where service users can pay user charges at economic levelsthere is no constraint, in principle, to exclusive private sector investment. The main area ofpolicy concern in such sectors is the removal of regulatory risk. The rapid technological changethat characterised telecommunications over the past decade gave rise to unavoidable regulatorychanges, which often trailed technology. New kinds of services became possible, and fallingequipment prices often gave new entrants an advantage over incumbents, giving rise to disputesover tariff issues. Although technical change in telecommunications is continuing to take place,it is probable that the big tide of innovation of the 1990s has now receded.  Similar has been thecase in the power sector, where information technology has made possible consumer choice andcompetition possible where none was thought feasible earlier. Here also, regulators have had tocope with new forms of organizational frameworks that require new kinds of regulatoryintervention. These kinds of problems are intrinsic to sectors where rapid technical change istaking place.There are other kinds of regulatory risks that can indeed be removed. These relate toregulatory predictability and transparency. The principles of regulation must be well thought out,articulated transparently and reasoned. They must be technically sound so that they can beunderstood and accepted by market participants. If this is done, abrupt and ad hoc changes willbe automatically avoided and private investment will flow. The various regulatory authorities inIndia are still in their infancy and can still be characterized to be on a steep learning curve. They24have been handicapped by the lack of technical expertise at both the staff and authority levels.Thus, many of their operations can be characterized as "learning by doing". Staffing at theAuthority level has typically been done by the re-employment of retired civil servants; and thatat the staff level through temporary secondments from government departments. The authoritieshave exhibited a marked reluctance to hire from the market, both at the authority and staff levels.Regulatory authorities in other countries typically have a better mix of staff that include technicalexperts hired from the market along with a sprinkling of civil servants. With the imposition ofpublic sector compensation structures, it is difficult to attract appropriate expertise at any level.Thus, a key requirement is that regulatory authorities must be made financially andadministratively autonomous. The remuneration of technical staff as well as of their membersmust be market related but made transparent for accountability. The ultimate responsibility fortheir actions does rest with government and Parliament, hence accountability has to built intotheir governance structure.A good degree of regulatory risk arises from government or political interference in thework of the regulator, though it would be naïve to argue that the regulator must be completelyimmune to political and government pressures. The regulator is ultimately responsible togovernment and Parliament. This problem can be reduced by the articulation of conditions andthe manner in which government can give directions to the regulator in a transparent manner. Ashas been provided in Sri Lanka, for example, where government direction results in revenue lossto the operators, it must have a responsibility to provide equivalent budgetary funds for that loss.Tariffs are both the most contentious of issues that regulators handle, and also the raisond'etre for their formation. It is with the objective of removing the tariff setting processes frompolitical pressures that regulators are often set up. Hence, it is doubly important for Governmentto devise procedures and conventions that allow regulators to function independently in tariffsetting. Thus, it is important for the government to approach the achievement of a bipartisanconsensus on tariff issues. This would involve wide public education and discussion onprinciples of pricing utilities. It is only if there is better understanding of these issues, and of thenecessity of economic pricing, can there be any hope of regulators being allowed to do rationaleconomic pricing.A higher level of independence, financial autonomy, and technical expertise in regulatoryauthorities will do much to remove avoidable regulatory risk. Distancing of government fromtariff decisions will also reduce inevitable special interest lobbying that often results indysfunctional outcomes. Transparency in the appointments process would also contribute togreater independence and credibility of regulators.FinancingThe second issue related to private sector investment in infrastructure is the availabilityof financing of adequate magnitude and structure. Each infrastructure sector has its own differentcharacteristics and financing mechanisms need to correspond to these characteristics. Forexample, once a power station or toll road is built, and tariffs are set in a transparent andpredictable manner, the cash flows are fairly regular and predictable.  They can then besecuritized easily. However, the pre-operation risk is extremely high: hence risk mitigation, and25credit enhancement is necessary to attract resources at reasonable cost. Market instruments needto be designed to meet these requirements, along with specific government interventions, wherenecessary, in order to mitigate pre-operative risk.The 1990s witnessed a great degree of innovation in structured finance all across theworld. The huge expansion of cross border flows of capital aided this explosion of innovation. Itwas also the period during which the former socialist economies made their transit towards themarket system: all of them had large backlogs of infrastructure investment that had to befinanced. Similarly, China, Indonesia and other fast growing East-Asian countries exhibited greatdemand for infrastructure finance. The exuberance of international capital flows, particularlytowards developing countries has dampened during this decade and hence needs some revival.As already noted, the initial expectations of return to equity were perhaps excessive, andparticularly unsuited to infrastructure investment. Thus, a new look is needed at the internationalarrangements for cross border flows of finances for infrastructure investment. The internationalfinancial institutions can look more carefully from the point of view of both the investors andrecipients. In some cases, large investments have been made for the privatisation of existingutilities, particularly in Latin America. In other cases, green field investments have also beenmade in areas such as telecom, power and roads. Serious problems have arisen for investorswhere large changes have taken place in currency adjustments that were characteristic of the1990s. Equity investors have consequently suffered through loss of return whereas, in the case ofdebt, recipient countries have encountered debt servicing problems. These issues need to begiven due attention in the discussions related to the new financial architecture. Mechanisms needto be evolved to provide some protection to both potential investors and recipients so that largefinancial flows for infrastructure investments can be rekindled. Mechanisms could be devised forcredit enhancement of borrowers. Similarly, it should be possible to find ways and means forproviding a floor of return to investment below which some form of investment insurance kicksin. The floor should clearly be below the level of market return to minimise moral hazard.Various developments have taken place in the recent past that should make it easier forresources to be intermediated towards infrastructure projects. The government securities markethas developed well and hence debt market benchmarks are now available. It is now quite a liquidmarket and government securities can also be traded in the stock exchanges. Thus, thetechnological infrastructure for the debt market is in place in the stock exchanges. Interest ratederivatives are about to be introduced to aid in risk management. An act has been passed recentlyenabling securitization of receivables on a widespread basis. The same Act has also strengthenedcreditor rights.The Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) was founded in 1997 as ajoint venture between the Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India, domestic financialinstitutions, and foreign investors like the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the InternationalFinance Corporation (IFC), among others. Thus, institutional financing is also available forinfrastructure.  In fact, credit disbursed from the banking system for infrastructure has increasedfrom 1.0 per cent of overall non food credit in March 1998 to 3.0 per cent in end-March 2003.IDFC itself has disbursed Rs.28.5 billion until March 2002. Thus, there is no shortage of creditavailability for viable infrastructure projects.26The equity market has been generally dormant since the mid-1990s. Hence, raisingprivate equity has not been easy, particularly with the decline of the Unit Trust of India(UTI).Accordingly, a new initiative, the India Development Fund has also been initiated to help privatesector promoters to raise equity. It is expected that this fund will amount to Rs.10 billion shortly.Furthermore, private sector insurance companies have begun operations and the entry ofindependent pension funds has now been announced. Thus, a greater variety and volume ofinstitutional investors will now become available for both direct and indirect investment ininfrastructure.Thus institutional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and thelike can increasingly create specialised vehicles such as this to channel equity funds intoinfrastructure projects, where risk capital is otherwise scarce. International infrastructure fundswere the rage in the 1990s. They need to be emulated domestically in India now, but perhapswith a greater degree of realism in terms of expected returns. If such infrastructure equity fundssucceed, they can also operate as credit enhancement vehicles bringing other equity investors tothe market in their wake.A major development that has taken place in recent years is the significant reduction ininflation on a sustained basis, both internationally and in India. It was during the days of 7-10 percent annual inflation that equity investors expected 20-25 per cent returns on risk capital,particularly international investors. With inflationary expectations having come down to 3-5 percent levels, there should be a corresponding reduction in both costs of debt and equity. Thisshould also make formerly unviable projects viable, and hence amenable to commercialinvestment. The consequent reduction in user charges necessary for viability would also comedown, leading to greater acceptability.There also needs to be greater learning from the many different financing techniquesemployed in developed countries, which effectively amount to private financing of publicinfrastructure or of private-public partnerships. Two patent examples come to mind. In theUnited States, municipal bonds, having been made tax free by the Federal Government enablelocal governments to tap the large U.S. capital market to finance local urban and otherinfrastructure. Because of the tax free status recognising the public good element in urbaninfrastructure, they could raise finances at lower cost, thus keeping user charges at affordablelevels or municipal taxes at acceptable rates. The institution of municipal bonds providesinternalised incentives for local authorities to be fiscally prudent: defaults on municipal bondservicing causes great hardship. The Pfandbrief system in Germany is another effective exampleof private financing of public infrastructure. In their case, it is large mortgage banks that poollocal authority debt into "pfandbriefs", which is effective credit enhancement of entities that maynot otherwise be creditworthy. Pfandbriefs have succeeded in keeping up their credit quality formore than a hundred years, through hyper inflation and two world wars. There is a complexsystem of government guarantees that underlies this system. In India too, and in other developingcountries, thought needs to be given to how such innovative systems can be derived to generategreater private financing of infrastructure.In sum, there continue to be great opportunities for devising viable financing systems forthe funding of infrastructure in both the public and private sectors. Much greater information is27available on different techniques; now technology makes possible financing systems not earlieravailable; and cross border flows can again be rekindled. The fall in inflation and interest ratesshould also make hitherto unviable projects financially viable.Management in the Public SectorEven if all constraints are removed for private sector investments, there will continue tobe a very significant presence of the public sector in infrastructure, both in existing entities aswell as in new investments.  Most roads, except for toll roads, will necessarily remain in thepublic sector; as will sewerage systems; public lighting, and other similar components of urbaninfrastructure. Water supply systems, particularly distribution systems are natural monopolies,and will always have large public good elements embedded in them. Water generation,purification, treatment, etc. can indeed be privatised but the rest of the system will either remainin public sector hands or be heavily regulated. Similarly, in the railways, it is difficult to privatisethe common carrier, i.e. the track, whereas operation of trains, maintenance, etc. can potentiallybe privatised, though the international experience of the private sector operating the railways is,at best, mixed. In other areas, such as ports and airports, whereas activities such as operation ofterminals, traffic handling, and airline operation and shipping, are typically in the private sector,port or airport ownership as landlords is typically in the public sector. Thus, public investment ininfrastructure will remain essential indefinitely, as will be a good part of its operation.This must be understood and appreciated better. A much greater focus, than is the case atpresent, must be placed on public sector management. The public sector that continues to exist ininfrastructure must be commercially oriented and must have the best of management skills, sinceinfrastructure systems are typically large systems. There is a great need for instilling excellencein public management systems. Capabilities need to be built up to bring in modern managementsystems. The best managers in the system must be attracted to such activities. As happens inmany systems, the public sector and governmental management systems in India have becomeossified with excessive rigidities and careerism built in. Entry into these systems is essentially atthe basic entry level, with little or no mobility of personnel at higher levels. There is littleinfusion of new blood at higher levels, except at the Board level and excessive in-breeding andinward looking attitudes have become the norm. What is needed is a system of induction ofoutside expertise at all levels in an organised framework. Labour mobility is hampered by therigidities in the social security system where pensions and other similar benefits are not portable.Great change has taken place around the world, and in India, in management systems.Public sector management, be it in  public sector enterprises, central, state or municipalgovernments, needs to be modernised to take on the new challenges. Public sector systems aretypically large systems and, therefore, intrinsically more challenging. Young people of highcalibre need to be attracted to these activities in much the same way as the best and mostdynamic corporations attract the best talent to their portals.In the current system in India, which now has a mix of public and private companies inthe same sector, great inequalities in compensation have crept in between people performingsimilar functions. This issue needs to be tackled head on and an acceptable methodology foundto address it.28A major issue in public sector management is the tenure of chief executives. In the IndianRailways, for example, the chief executive, the Chairman of the Railway Board seldom has atenure greater than one year. With such a tenure, he can scarcely be expected to have even amedium term vision, let alone a long term one of bringing any change into the system. Even if hedoes, he certainly would have no chance of implementing it. Experience in India has been that incases where there has been stability of leadership enterprises have performed relatively well. Thesystem of promotion by seniority is not conducive to commercial operation.There is great need, therefore, for new thinking on public sector management. Whereasprivatization must be pursued with vigour, it is equally important to instill pride and excellencein public sector management.Public Private PartnershipsGiven that most infrastructure sectors exhibit some public good characteristics,investment can be maximized through public private partnerships. If the achievable return to aninfrastructure activity through the levy of user charges is, say, 70 per cent of market returns, apublic subsidy of 30 per cent would elicit market based private investment, and the enterprisecan then run on commercial basis. One example of such an activity has already been given in thecase of toll roads.  Another example could be that of urban water supply where some water hasto be given free for the less well off through public standposts; another could be forunremunerative railway lines that are deemed necessary for other objectives. Such partnershipsare, however, not easy to do in a democratic parliamentary framework : inevitable questions ariseon award of concessions and contracts. Hence, a great deal of work needs to be done to devisemethodologies for the development of public private partnerships: this also requires excellence inpublic sector management.None of this is possible unless infrastructure is productive: it must either improveproductivity so that the gains result in higher tax revenues, or directly through the collection ofuser charges.* I am grateful to Mr.Y.S.P Thorat, Dr. Michael Patra, Ms. Jaya Mohanty and Dr. A.Prasad of the RBI for theirassistance.
