Mr. G.P. Muniappan, Deputy Governor’s Remarks –FICCI Seminar onSeptember 11, 2002 at MumbaiI. Introduction to the theme and the speakersThe theme for this session is a very broad one, encompassing the entire framework ofregulation. However, it is very relevant in today’s times given the focus on the regulation andsupervision of the institutions in the financial sector. This focus has emerged in the context ofthe large number of financial sector crises and bank failures, which have plagued almost allthe economies in the world over the last two decades. These crises can have severeimplications not only for depositors who find their savings evaporating overnight, but also forthe taxpayers, and the resolution costs of some of these episodes have been as high as 40% ofthe GDP in some countries.There have been two main dimensions of the issues relating to governance and regulation ofthe financial sector –(i) the rationale, contents and sequencing of the process of regulation andregulatory reform and(ii) the appropriate institutional framework of regulation.I am glad that the two speakers we have today will be covering both these major dimensions.First, Shri Dalbir Singh, CMD of Central Bank of India, who represents the bankingcommunity in India as the Chairman of the Indian Banks Association, will speak on thebroader issues relating to regulation in the Indian context. He is a familiar figure to all of youand needs no introduction.While he represents the institutions, i.e the demand side of regulation, he will be followed byMr. Michael Ainley, who represents the supply side, i.e. the regulators. He will deliver thekeynote address for this session and in his talk, he will take us through the issues ofappropriate institutional framework of regulation, drawing from the experience of theFinancial Services Authority of the UK. The FSA, and its precursor, the Bank of Englandboth hold a position of eminence in the pantheon of national supervisors and their systemsand processes have provided the blueprint for supervisors all over the world.We are very fortunate to have Michael here with us – he is one of the most respectedmembers of the international supervisory fraternity and it has been my pleasure to have hadhis professional acquaintance over the last few years both in his capacity as the hostsupervisor of our banks in UK and as the member of several international groups andcommittees where we have served together.I will now request Shri Dalbir Singh to give his comments, after which I will invite MichaelAinley and his associate Anna Heynes to familiarize us with the UK experience.II. Comments on Dalbir Singh’s presentation:As has been rightly pointed out by Mr. Singh, protection of the depositor’s interest remainsthe cornerstone of bank regulation here in India, and this objective is enjoined upon us by theBanking Regulation Act. This has become even more critical these days in the wake of thefailure of several urban cooperative banks, and has been the guiding pillar for supervisorypolicy with regard to the resolution of weak and failed banks. In fact, even in cases where theconcerned state governments have asked us to facilitate their bailout packages for weak urbanbanks, we have insisted that they first provide explicit safety nets for existing depositors inany resolution strategy.However, there is a growing awareness of the objective of preserving the systemic stabilityand preventing contagion effects from seeping across institutions. In the light of thissupplementary objective, deposit insurance takes on an important role in fulfilling thedepositor protection mandate, and we are in the process of introducing major reforms in theDICGC.Mr. Singh has also touched bravely on a very sensitive point – that of the sensitivity of theinstitutions in the financial sector to any adverse development. This is due to the highlyleveraged characteristics of the balance sheets of banks, which makes them prone to runs inthe event of depositor panic. We have witnessed several situations where such circumstanceshave built up without any fundamental deterioration in either liquidity or solvency.  In somecases this has been caused by overzealous competitive practices by the new marketing savvybanks and in some cases by media reports of financial problems.Mr. Singh has also mentioned about the fungible nature of finance being another reason forthe tight regulation of finance. Banks have often argued that the fungible nature of fundsmakes it difficult for them to keep track of the flow of funds, but our view always has beenthat banks should have enough information on their borrowers to gauge when their clientsindulge in such unethical practices. In fact, this aspect has been the focus of our recent effortsto provide guidance on the issue of diversion of bank funds and subsequent willful default.A level playing field is no longer the issue since all banks, whether in the public or privatesector or in the foreign or domestic sector, are subject to broadly the same set of rules. It ismore a question of how the game is played, and if all players agree to be fair while beingcompetitive at the same time. In fact, our analysis of the performance of banks shows that thebanks which have continuously out-performed their competitors have not done so becausethey have a regulatory advantage in any way. Their success has been due to operationalefficiency brought about by the use of information technology, risk management systems,reduced operating costs and good corporate governance practices.On the issue of accounting standards, I may mention that consequent to the announcementmade in the Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2001-2002,  aWorking Group has been constituted under the Chairmanship President of the ICAI, withrepresentatives,  of IBA, banks and RBI, in order to identify the compliance as also gaps incompliance with Accounting Standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants ofIndia (ICAI) and to recommend steps to eliminate/reduce the gaps.The issue Mr. Singh has raised regarding universal banking being the order of the day is notas straight as it seems. This is a path which should be tread carefully, and all the participantshave to take into account the interests of all the stakeholders including the investors. Thisterm normally refers to a bank undertaking all types of business – retail, wholesale, merchant,private etc under one organizational roof. This is already possible for banks in India.However, this term has taken on an extended meaning after the Khan Committee report wasreleased a few years ago, and is now associated with the harmonization of business of banks2and development financial institutions and their possible merger. However desirable mergersmay seem to the market, there are a host of issues which have to be taken into account whiledealing with merger proposals. For instance, in the absence of the private sector’s willingnessto risk absorbing the losses of weak institutions, their merger  with public sector banks isoften presented as a fait accompli. However, the question that this raises is whether thiswould tantamount to fiscal profligacy given that the taxpayers funds are being committed tothe revival of a weak institution where there is no guarantee of success.Mr. Singh has commented on the gradual process followed by us in opening up the bankingsector first to private sector then to international participation. Gradualism has been thehallmark of our financial sector policy, as it allows for the participants to absorb majorchanges incrementally without there being any major turbulence. We had begun bypermitting the entry of the new banks in the private sector, and have now sought to strengthenthem by enhancing the level of foreign participation. This is expected to strengthen thecorporate governance, risk management and technological competence of these banks. Somebanks have successfully managed to attract foreign capital and this is a route which othercapital banks could also explore. We are encouraging such foreign capital participation andhave written to the Government to relax the ceiling on voting rights in such cases in view ofthe importance of this source of capital.Finally, I am happy that Mr. Singh has commended the process of consultation that we arenow following with regard to the formulation of regulatory policy. I would like to assure himand all the bankers here that we intend to continue this process forward.III. Comments on Michael Ainley’s presentation:Michael’s presentation has been very informative and we are grateful to him for thisexperience sharing exercise which he has shared with us.As has been pointed out by him, after the UK’s move to a single regulator, many othercountries have also followed the same path. However, the reasons for doing so have beendifferent – in some cases a major loss event or crisis has been the trigger, in some cases it isthe expansion of financial conglomerates has led to this decision, while in some cases it hassimply been the case of “follow the leader.”In India, too, this topic has been the subject of some discussion. There are two aspects to thisissue –(i) unification of regulation under one authority and(ii) segregation of the unified authority from the central bank.While Michael has pointed out the advantages of unification, there are several well-documented disadvantages –(i) unification makes it difficult to strike balance between different regulatoryobjectives(ii) it results in diseconomies of scale(iii) synergy gains from unification may not be more than the costs of unification(iv) The same model may not work in different jurisdictions given the differentlegislative and political framework.(v) Bank supervisory capacity may get compromised by unification of agencies3(vi) Finally, the most significant disadvantage of the decision to create a unifiedregulator is the unpredictability of the change process itself together with theconcomitant danger that the discussion itself may gain momentum to such a stagethat change becomes inevitable, whether it is appropriate or not.The debate on the appropriate form of institutional framework for regulation is likely tocontinue for some more time. As it stands,  a study of a sample of 73 countries in 2000 byAbrams and Taylor showed that only 13 of these followed a model of unified supervision(out of which 3 had unified supervision within the central bank, 10 outside it). Further, due toa host of issues, most of which are to do with the limited availability of financial and humanresources, developing countries prefer to keep bank supervision with the central banks as hadbeen reflected in data from a sample of 123 countries studied by Hawkesby in 2000 whichshows that banking supervision was located within the central bank in as many as 78% of thedeveloping countries while this was so in only 35% of the industrial countries.Unification has not yet found favour in India because the markets and the institutions remainlargely segmented and financial conglomerates are a rarity in the Indian context. Further,though the linkages between banking, securities and insurance has grown in the past fewyears with DFI’s having set up banks, and banks dealing in insurance and securities productsand participating directly in the capital market. However, these linkages have not grown to anextent that the overlaps or grey areas in their regulation have become significant.The markets also still deal largely in vanilla products and sophisticated instruments whichstraddle all there sectors have not been in evidence. Most of the products which are beingoffered are stand alone and do not combine the features of all three types. What will probablywork best in such an environment are mechanisms to enhance coordination and cooperationbetween the existing regulators. In fact, one coordinating arrangement which has beenproposed earlier by Dr. Y V Reddy, and which is known as the Reddy formula, suggested anumbrella regulatory legislation which creates an apex regulatory authority without disturbingthe existing jurisdictions.However, there is a lot which we have taken from the re-engineering process being followedin the FSA. We have been looking closely at their rating models and framework and havealso sent several of our officers to FSA to interact with them. In the past some of our officershave even been seconded to the FSA for several months and have come back enriched by theexperience. The FSA supervisory process has been studied by us in the course of formulatingour Risk Based Approach to supervision.This is an opportune moment for me to dwell upon the recent developments in the area ofbank supervision and regulation. As I have mentioned , we are embarking on the path to RiskBased Supervision, which would be introduced in phases beginning from 2003. A dedicatedProject Implementation Group set up in the Reserve Bank is addressing the transitional andchange management issues for facilitating a smooth switchover to RBS based on therecommendations of PricewaterhouseCoopers, London.The RBS model consists of(i) development of a risk profile for each bank,(ii) designing a customised supervisory action plan for each bank based on the riskprofile,4(iii) delineating the scope and extent of supervision to target high risk areas and areasof supervisory concern, and(iv) strengthening quality assurance and enforcement functions to maintain objectivityand neutrality in application of supervisory standards.The RBS approach will involve allocation of supervisory resources in accordance with therisk profile of a bank. A high-risk bank will be subjected to enhanced supervisory focusthrough a shorter supervisory cycle and greater use of various supervisory tools like targetedinspections, intensive off-site surveillance, structured meetings with bank management,commissioned audits, etc. On the other hand a low risk bank will be subjected to a longersupervisory cycle and use of fewer supervisory tools.Thus, the RBS approach will lead to an optimum use of supervisory resources through focuson the targeted banks and the specific areas within the banks that pose the greatest risk to thesystem and to the supervisory objectives.The implementation of RBS calls for certain preparedness on the part of commercial bankslike setting up comprehensive risk management systems, adopting a risk-focused internalaudit system, upgrading the management information and Information Technology-basedsystems, setting up dedicated compliance units and addressing issues related to HRD and skilldevelopment. A discussion paper on RBS giving a background of the approach, its objectives,the processes involved and the specific bank level preparedness required for successfulimplementation has been circulated among banks. They have also been involved in aconsultative process through high-level meetings to identify areas requiringassistance/guidance.The designing of the templates for risk profiling of banks, preparation of a new manualapplicable to the new supervisory approach as well as upgradation of technical skills of bothcommercial bank staff and RBI supervisory staff is currently engaging the attention of theReserve Bank. RBS is intended to be implemented in phases with a target to commission itduring the next year.  We have already begun imparting training on this area to bothsupervisors and bankers, and would have trained a critical mass of both by the time RBS isintroduced.We have also prepared a scheme for Prompt Corrective Action or PCA, which lays out theremedial actions to be taken by banks and the supervisors in the case of banks breachingcertain specified trigger points of capital adequacy, return on assets and NPAs.The Reserve Bank is committed to the implementation of the “Core Principles for EffectiveBanking Supervision” drawn up by BCBS. It is a matter of satisfaction that the bankingsystem in India is largely compliant with most of the Core Principles. We have alreadyinitiated measures to achieve full compliance with these principles.  We have alreadycirculated draft guidelines to banks on country risk management and provisioning thereforeand expect to finalise them shortly. With regard to consolidated supervision of banks andbank groups we have taken several initiatives to move towards a system of consolidatedsupervision such as voluntarily building-in the risk-weighted components of their subsidiariesinto their own balance sheet on a notional basis and  to annexe the balance sheet, profit andloss account, report of the board of directors and the report of the auditors in respect of eachof their subsidiaries to their own balance sheets beginning from the year ended March 2001.5Subsequently,  a multi-disciplinary Working Group was set up in November 2000 by ReserveBank of India (RBI) to look into the introduction of consolidated accounting and other relatedquantitative techniques of consolidated supervision and to make recommendationsaccordingly. The recommendations of this group, which are centered around consolidation ofaccounts and its reporting and disclosure through Consolidated Financial Statements andConsolidated Prudential reports, will be implemented shortly.We have devoted significant resources to the prevention of Money Laundering in tune withthe international supervisory community and commercial banks in India are mandated toadhere to “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedures for prevention of misuse of the bankingsystem for money laundering and financing of terrorist activity. Further, systemicimprovements in monitoring the implementation and enhanced due-diligence procedures oncorrespondent relationship are under introduction. The passage of the “Prevention ofTerrorism Act” has strengthened the legal; framework towards countering financing ofterrorist activity. The enactment of “Prevention of Money Laundering Bill: should furtherstrengthen AML initiatives and compliance with FATF recommendations. Govt. of India inconsultation with RBI, would initiate further steps for compliance of  FATFrecommendations.Our initiatives have not been confined to the area of regulation and supervision alone. Wecontinue to foster institutional structures and mechanisms which would strengthen theexisting financial infrastructure. Some of these  recent initiatives have been the facilitation ofthe setting up of a Credit Information Bureau, which would provide banks with a mechanismto access credit information and a mechanism for Corporate Debt Restructuring. .The banks and the markets have responded well to our regulatory initiatives and there hasbeen considerable improvement as reflected in certain key performance  parameters. This hasalso helped in containing NPAs in the banking system over the years and maintaining thedesired level of capital adequacy. The gross NPA ratio has continuously declined from 12.7%to 10.7% between March 31, 2000 and March 31, 2002 while the net NPA ratio has fallenfrom 6.8% to 5.8% in the same period. The Capital Adequacy Ratio, too, has increased from111.1% to 11.8% over the same period. In conclusion, I would like to briefly point to some of the changes that we may expect in theregulation of banks in the coming years. The agenda will be dominated by theimplementation of the proposals of the New Capital Accord, which through its three pillarapproach, would have a far reaching impact on the systems and processes in banks andsupervisory agencies. It will provide a fillip to risk management systems, and banks whichhave good internal ratings systems based on sound risk management practices, can expect toget some relief in capital through the implementation of the IRB approach. We would beexpecting all Indian banks which are operating internationally or those which are significantin the domestic system, to gradually implement this approach over the coming few years.At the same time, the Pillar II proposals for supervisory review would strengthen theimplementation of RBS and PCA, while the increased disclosure through the Pillar III  willstrengthen market discipline. However, the implementation of these proposals would requirea significant strengthening by both bankers and their supervisors, and I would enjoin upon all                                               1 2002 figures are provisional6of you present here to embark upon a major exercise in skill development so that you areready for the challenges and sophistication that this will require.7
