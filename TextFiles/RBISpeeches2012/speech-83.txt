Changing Contours of Global Crisis- Impact on Indian Economy* 
- Anand Sinha 
__________________________________________________________________ 
 
Dr. Devi Singh, Director, IIM Lucknow and Mentor Director, IIM Kashipur; Professor 
Manoj Anand; other members of the faculty; my fellow bankers and the young and 
‘raring to go’ students of Indian Institute of Management, Kashipur.  A very good 
evening to you all. I deem it a privilege to address young and bright students like this. 
I see in them the willingness to listen, courage to question and the enthusiasm to 
take on challenges that the future holds for them.   In short, I see in them, the 
answers to the challenges we face today.  It is always energizing as well as 
educating to interact with students and that is the precise reason why I had no 
second thoughts in accepting the invitation to interact with them even at a place far 
off from my workplace, Mumbai.    
2.   IIM, Kashipur is the youngest IIM.  There is a benefit in being young in 
the group.  You have a pool of experience to choose from and to learn.  At the same 
time, the challenges of being young in the group are also quite daunting.  You are 
expected to reach and maintain the heights reached by your seniors and even 
surpass them.  Looking at the enthusiasm of the students today, I am sure IIM, 
Kashipur will soon emerge as one of the premier institutions among IIMs.   
3.   The topic chosen for today’s address, on the face of it, looks quite 
jaded.  So much has already been said, discussed, analysed, dissected and written 
about the crisis.  The crisis which erupted in 2007 has, in no time, engulfed the 
consciousness of the public so much, that no finance speech is complete without a 
reference to it nor is a finance book consummate without a chapter devoted.  Going 
by the number of books published on crisis, one would not be greatly surprised if

 publishing industry was one of the few industries that stayed afloat, or in fact, thrived 
during the crisis.  
4.   Then, why am I deliberating on a topic which has been discussed so 
much already?  It is because of two reasons- One, this crisis still continues to offer a 
wealth of information and lessons, which will remain relevant in times to come.  
Second, the crisis does not remain what it was, when it started.  The crisis which 
started off as a localized sub-prime crisis has morphed into a financial crisis leading 
to a full blown global economic crisis and has now taken the shape of a sovereign 
debt crisis. While its current spread is localized in Eurozone, its impact continues to 
be felt all across the globe.  It is in this context that I would place my talk today on the 
changing contours of crisis and its impact on the Indian economy.   
 
I. Calm before the storm- A period of great moderation 
5.   The period preceding the Global Crisis was a phase of Great 
Moderation representing the decline in macroeconomic volatility (both output as well 
as inflation).  The period was marked by strong worldwide GDP growth coupled with 
low or stable inflation and very low interest rates which lulled the policy makers and 
the economists into believing that their search for ‘holy grail’ was over and the magic 
formula of strong growth with low inflation had been finally discovered.  The great 
1
moderation was attributed to (i) structural changes that may have increased 
macroeconomic flexibility and stability  such as improved management of business 
inventories  made possible by advances in computation and communication, 
increased depth and sophistication of financial markets, deregulation in many 
industries, the shift away from manufacturing to services and increased openness to

 trade and international capital flows etc. (ii) improved performance of macroeconomic 
policies or (iii) good luck.  The role of good luck in maintaining great moderation was 
extensively discussed and debated and, as anyone would expect, its role was 
discounted when things were going good.  
6.   The problem in attributing entire credit to good luck is that it leaves you 
unprepared and vulnerable to shocks since, by relying solely on luck, you become 
effectively, a prisoner of circumstances.    On the other hand, not giving luck its 
rightful due encourages you to overrate yourself and leaves you underprepared when 
a crisis hits.   
7.   Whatever was the reason, the good times did not last long and the 
period of great moderation came to an end by 2007 when the crisis erupted.   The 
impact of the crisis on financial world was immense. The global growth slumped, 
unemployment burgeoned, interbank markets froze on account of heightened 
counterparty concerns and risk aversion, banking activity plummeted while the non-
performing loans increased and many large and famous institutions were obliterated 
from the face of financial world. The impact of the crisis on the non-financial front 
was no less.  In fact, the crisis caused deeper impact on the intellectual world, by 
rubbishing concepts and theories that were held sacrosanct till then.  Analysts, 
researches and policymakers huddled to diagnose the reasons for the crisis and 
came out with various theories and explanations.  The more plausible explanation 
goes this way.  Differences in the consumption and investment patterns among 
countries (a saving glut in Asia and oil exporting countries and a spending binge in 
the United States) have resulted in emergence of global imbalances which led to 
large capital flows from surplus countries into deficit countries which were mostly the 
advanced countries.

8.   These capital flows have resulted in a surge of liquidity in advanced 
economies leading to low interest rates.  Both the short term as well as the long term 
real interest rates remained too low for a too long period. Low interest rates forced 
the investors to hunt for yield which sowed the seeds for asset inflation.  Financial 
engineering assumed the centre stage in a bid to design and offer high yielding 
products to investors.

9.   In addition to the above factors, gaps in the regulatory framework also 
played their part in accentuating crisis.  The following reasons are widely attributed to 
the outbreak of crisis-  inadequate quantity and quality of capital, insufficient liquidity 
buffers, excessively leveraged financial institutions, inadequate coverage of certain 
risks, absence of a regulatory framework for addressing systemic risks, proliferation 
of opaque and poorly understood financial products in search of yields in the 
backdrop of an era of ‘great moderation’, perverse incentive structure in 
securitisation process, lack of transparency in OTC markets particularly the CDS, 
inadequate regulation and supervision, and a burgeoning under/unregulated shadow 
banking system. 
10. While all these factors were playing in the background creating a perfect 
recipe for the crisis, the most proximate cause for the Crisis was the developments in 
2
the US subprime market.  As observed by Raghuram Rajan , growing income 
inequality in the United States, stemming from unequal access to quality education, 
led to political pressure for more housing credit which led to distorted lending in the 
financial sector.  In a classic case of best intentions leading to worst outcomes due to 
bad implementation, the envisaged policy of financial inclusion by enabling homeless 
to own homes, led to reckless lending in sub-prime market and, eventually, resulted 
in a meltdown.

11. The crisis, when erupted in 2007, started off as a mere sub-prime crisis 
localized in the US.  But soon the crisis spread to other markets cutting across 
geographical boundaries signifying the extent of the global integration.  The subprime 
crisis became a banking crisis due to the exposures banks had to the subprime 
assets which were fast turning bad.  Counterparty concerns exacerbated, leading to 
freezing of global interbank markets.  The crisis had spread to other jurisdictions 
through various channels of contagion- trade, finance and most importantly, 
confidence.  Foreign investors started withdrawing investments from emerging 
markets pushing them also into liquidity crisis.  By Oct 2008, when Lehman Brothers 
had collapsed under the weight of sub-prime exposures, the crisis had become truly 
global, both in spread and impact.  
12. The crisis had a devastating impact on the world economy in terms of output 
losses and rise in unemployment.  It had impacted all the segments of the global 
financial markets in terms of heightened volatility, tighter credit conditions, low asset 
prices and increased write downs.  The policy makers, regulators and the sovereigns 
had to immediately step in and initiate measures to mitigate the impact of crisis.  
Page 6 of 28 
 There have been many measures, both conventional and unconventional, that were 
taken which provided relief to the badly battered global economy.    
13. Just when we thought the crisis was behind us, with economies slowly limping 
back to normalcy, another crisis hit the World.  In a classic case of cure being 
more painful than the disease, various fiscal measures taken to mitigate the impact 
of 2007 crisis have, along with  other factors, led to huge and unsustainable 
sovereign debts resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in Eurozone.   Countries that 
have run up huge fiscal deficits, either to maintain populist policies or to bail out 
institutions during the global crisis by guaranteeing failing banks etc., have suddenly 
found themselves on the verge of bankruptcy unable to honour their obligations and 
the word ‘sovereign debt’ suddenly ceased to evoke images of a riskless (less risky, 
at least) asset.     
14. With this background in place, I would now move on to the central theme of 
the talk today ‘Changing Contours of global Crisis- Impact on Indian Economy’.  
I intend to cover the impact of both the crises i.e. Global Crisis 2007 and the current 
sovereign debt crisis, on Global and Indian economies with specific focus on real 
sector, financial markets and the banking system.    
 
II. Global Crisis 
a. Impact on Global economy 
15.  Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the global 
inter-bank financial markets froze in view of large losses suffered by the major 
financial institutions and the extreme uncertainty over the health of the counterparty 
balance sheets. This had a knock on effect on various segments of financial markets, 
including inter-bank markets. Fire sales by investors contributed to further downward 
Page 7 of 28 
 pressures on asset prices, leading to a vicious cycle of distress sales and declining 
asset prices. Heightened risk aversion and search for safe havens led to 
deleveraging by investors and consequent sharp and substantial retrenchment in 
capital flows to emerging and developing economies.  All this turmoil in various 
segments of the financial markets led to a sharp decline in economic activity in the 
major advanced economies. Unemployment rates soared and labour markets 
became weak. Given the high and growing degree of trade and financial integration 
between the advanced economies and the Emerging and Developing Economies 
(EDEs), activity in the EDEs also decelerated sharply.  
16. Real GDP growth in advanced economies turned negative in 2009 (- 3.7 per 
cent) from the strong pace of 2.9 per cent during 2004-07. Growth recovered 
modestly in 2010, but again turned anaemic in 2011 (1.6 per cent). Growth in 
advanced economies averaged a mere 0.3 per cent during 2008-11 and output still 
remains well below potential. The IMF expects growth in advanced economies to 
decelerate further to 1.2 per cent in 2012. Unemployment rate in the US more than 
doubled from 4.4 per cent in December 2006 to a peak of 10.0 per cent in October 
2009; it has since then eased, at a very gradual pace, to 8.5 per cent.

17. Capital flows (net) to EDEs more than halved from US $ 715 billion in 2007 to 
US $ 246 billion in 2008 as portfolio and banking flows turned negative. Reflecting 
the growth shock in the advanced economies as well as the retrenchment in capital 
flows, real GDP growth in the EDEs decelerated from 8.0 per cent during 2004-7 to 
2.8 per cent in 2009. It recovered quickly to 7.3 per cent in 2010. Overall, global GDP 
growth contracted to 0.6 per cent in 2009 from the robust growth of 5.0 per cent 
during 2004-07.  
18. In the global credit and money markets, the risk spreads had ballooned during 
3
the crisis period. The TED spread exceeded 300bps on September 17, 2008 
breaking the previous record set after the Black Monday crash of 1987 and, 
thereafter, reached an all time high of 464 bps on Oct 10, 2008. The 3M LIBOR-3M

OIS spread touched the high of 364 bps on October 10, 2008 as against the normal 
level of around 10 bps. The huge risk aversion was reflected in sharp decline in the 
stock indices across the globe and heightened volatility. Global equity markets 
witnessed major sell-offs in March 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 
registered the new twelve-year low of 6,547.05 (on closing basis) on March 9, 2009 
and had lost 20% of its value in only six weeks. The VIX index –a widely used 
measure of market risk and often referred to as the "investor fear gauge" – rose to a 
record high of 80.86 on November 20, 2008. The yields of the treasury securities 
plummeted on the back of safe haven demands, with the 10 year US Treasury yield 
touching a low of 2.05% on Dec 30, 2008. The three month T-Bill yield fell to (-) 4 
basis points, the lowest it has been since 1954 reflecting unprecedented flight-to-
5
safety. The CDS spreads widened markedly.  The major CDS indices , i.e. CDX 
Cross Over, CDX Investment Grade, iTraxx Europe crossover and iTraxx Europe, 
touched the highs of 699 bps, 242 bps, 1150 bps and 206 bps respectively during 
March 2009. In a parallel development, while other asset classes have fallen in 
value, commodity prices surged during this period. Financialisation of commodities is 
believed to have added to the inflationary pressure. Both Gold and Crude oil prices 
had spiralled during the period.

19. Global crisis has also severely affected the growth and health of global 
banking sector.  Bank credit growth in major economies such as US, UK, and the 
Eurozone secularly declined throughout 2009.  The asset quality has also been 
adversely impacted with NPA (as % of total loans) rising to higher levels.  The NPAs 
in the UK and US have risen from 0.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent in 2007 to 4.0 per 
cent and 4.9 per cent in 2009 respectively.  The capital position of the banks, 
however, remained comfortable with most global banks continuing to step up their 
capital positions notwithstanding the crisis.  By 2010, the Capital to Risk Weighted 
Assets Ratio (CRAR) was placed above 15 per cent for banks in UK, US, Japan and 
Germany.

b. Policy Responses: Global 
20. In response to the collapse in economic activity, large losses suffered by 
major banks and financial institutions and severe disruption in financial markets, 
there was an unprecedented policy response by both monetary and fiscal authorities. 
Given the severe impact on economic activity and the vicious circle of expectations, 
the policy response was globally coordinated. As economic activity slowed down 
sharply, monetary policy was eased aggressively in both advanced economies and 
EDEs. In major advanced economies, policy interest rates were cut to almost zero

09?2011levels by early 2009 which stayed around those levels even three years later (as of 
early 2012). Given the large unemployment rates and negative output gaps, the US 
Federal Reserve has indicated that the policy rate – the federal funds rate – will 
remain near zero till late 2014.  The policy rate would thus remain near zero for 
almost six years, going by the Fed’s current assessment. In view of near zero policy 
interest rates and limitations imposed by the zero bound on the interest rates, the US 
Federal Reserve and other major central banks in advanced economies have also 
resorted to unprecedented quantitative easing – substantial infusion of liquidity - in 
an attempt to ease credit and financing conditions and drive long-term yields lower.  
21. Turning to fiscal measures, to begin with, governments in major advanced 
economies provided direct support to the failing financial institutions. Subsequently, 
in view of the collapse of growth and the constraints posed by the lower zero bound 
on the interest rates, governments in almost all jurisdictions resorted to stimulus 
packages to boost activity. Despite the large fiscal and monetary stimuli, economic 
activity remained sluggish.  
C.  Impact of Crisis on India 
22. The global financial crisis impacted India significantly, notwithstanding the 
sound banking system, negligible exposure of Indian banks to sub-prime assets and 
relatively well-functioning financial markets. The impact was mainly on account of 
India’s growing trade and financial integration with the global economy. India’s two 
way trade (merchandize exports plus imports), as a proportion of GDP, was 40.7 per 
cent in 2008-09, the crisis year, up from 19.6 per cent in 1998-99. The ratio of total 
external transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital account flows) 
to GDP – an indicator of both trade and financial integration – was 112 per cent in 
2008-09 up from 44 per cent in 1998-99. 
Page 13 of 28 
 23. The immediate impact of the crisis was felt through large capital outflows and 
consequent fall in the domestic stock markets on account of sell-off by Foreign 
Institutional Investors and steep depreciation of the Rupee against US Dollar. The 
BSE Sensex (on closing basis), which had touched a peak of 20873 on January 8, 
2008, declined to a low of 8160 on March 9, 2009. While the capital outflows led to 
decline in the domestic forex liquidity, RBI’s intervention in the forex market resulted 
in tightening of Rupee liquidity. The inter-bank call money (overnight)  rates firmed up 
during the period from second half of September’ 08 to end October’ 08 (high of 
19.70 per cent on October 10). However, the series of liquidity augmenting measures 
undertaken by RBI resulted in call rates coming back to the normal levels from first 
week of November’08.  
24. Global recession had adversely affected the Indian exports resulting in 
widening of current account deficit (CAD).  Exports which grew at 25 per cent during 
2005/08 decelerated to 13.6 per cent in the crisis year (2008-09) and registered a 
negative growth of 3.5 per cent in 2009-10. Output growth, which averaged little less 
than 9 per cent in the previous five years and 9.5 per cent during the three year 
period 2005-08, dropped to 6.8 per cent in the crisis year (2008-09). 
25. In the pre-crisis years, capital inflows were far in excess of the current account 
deficit (CAD) and the Reserve Bank had to absorb these flows in its balance sheet. 
As global investors tried to rebalance their portfolios during the crisis period, the 
country witnessed large capital outflows immediately after the collapse of Lehman 
Brothers leading to a downward pressure on the rupee. The exchange rate 
depreciated from Rs. 39.37 per dollar in January 2008 to Rs. 51.23 per dollar in 
March 2009.

to raise resources through external sources of funding, turned to domestic bank and 
non-bank institutions for funding and also withdrew their investments from the liquid 
schemes of mutual funds. This, in turn, put redemption pressure on mutual funds 
(MFs) and, further along the chain, on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) for 
whom MFs were a significant source of funding.  
27. The Indian banking sector has, however, withstood the spillover effects of the 
global financial crisis as was evident in the robust CRAR and Tier 1 CRAR which 
remained far above the stipulated regulatory minimum of 9 per cent.  The asset 
Page 15 of 28 
 quality was also comfortable despite some slippages. By end March 2010, the Gross 
NPA ratio stood at 2.50 per cent (net NPA 1.13%) while the CRAR was 13.58 per 
cent.  The spillover effects of the crisis were, however, most visible in the credit 
growth of banking sector.  Since September 2008, the growth rate of advances, as 
also of assets, started witnessing a declining trend which continued for almost one 
year up to September 2009. The Y-o-Y growth in advances fell from 28.5 per cent at 
the end March 2007 to 12.3 per cent by end Sept 2009 while the Y-o-Y growth in 
assets fell from 22.9 per cent to 15.1 per cent during the same period.

d. Policy Response- India 
28. Given the deceleration in growth and drying up of capital flows, both the 
Reserve Bank and the Government undertook a number of measures to minimise the 
impact of the crisis on India. There was, however, a notable difference between 
Indian response and those of many EMEs, on the one hand, and the advanced

to contend with both the unfolding financial crisis and deepening recession, the 
Indian response was predominantly driven by the need to arrest moderation in 
economic growth. The main plank of the government response was fiscal stimulus 
while the Reserve Bank's action comprised counter-cyclical regulatory measures and 
also measures to ensure easy liquidity and monetary conditions. 
29. The Reserve Bank's policy measures were aimed at containing the contagion 
from the outside - to keep the domestic money and credit markets functioning 
normally and ensure that the liquidity stress did not trigger solvency cascades. As in 
the case of other central banks, both conventional and unconventional measures 
were undertaken. The conventional measures included, first, a sharp reduction in the 
policy interest rates – the effective policy rate was cut from 9 per cent (repo rate) in 
September 2008 to 3.25 per cent (reverse repo rate) in April 2009. Second, the cash 
reserve ratio was reduced from 9.0 per cent in September 2008 to 5 per cent in 
January 2009 with a view to injecting liquidity into the banking system. Third, liquidity 
injection in bulk was made through purchase of government securities under open 
market operation (OMO) and unwinding of the balances under Market Stabilization 
Scheme (MSS) through buy-back, redemptions and de-sequestering. Fourth, 
refinance facilities for export credit were enhanced. Measures were also taken for 
enhancing forex liquidity which included an upward adjustment of the interest rate 
ceiling on the deposits by non-resident Indians under FCNR (B) and NRE deposit 
accounts and relaxation in norms for external commercial borrowings (ECB). In view 
of the slowing economy and decelerating credit flow, the counter-cyclical regulatory 
measures introduced in 2006 were also reversed. 
Page 17 of 28 
 30. The unconventional measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India included; 
institution of a rupee-dollar swap facility for Indian banks to give them comfort in 
managing  short-term foreign funding requirements of their overseas branches;  
special liquidity support to banks for on-lending to mutual funds and non-banking 
financial companies; liquidity support to non-banking financial companies through a 
special purpose vehicle created for the purpose and expansion of the lendable 
resources available to apex finance institutions for refinancing credit extended to 
small industries, housing and exports. The measures undertaken by the Reserve 
Bank during September 2008- July 2009 have resulted in augmentation of 
actual/potential liquidity of Rs. 5, 61,700 cr.  
31. The fiscal stimulus measures, undertaken in December 2008 and January 
2009, included additional public spending as well as cuts in taxes. These stimulus 
packages came on top of an already announced expanded safety-net for rural poor, 
a farm loan waiver package and salary increases for government staff, all of which 
too stimulated demand. 
32. Taken together, the fiscal and monetary measures were successful in 
achieving their objectives. Financial markets and the banking sector began to 
function normally. Real GDP growth which took a hit in 2008-09 as it reached 6.8 per 
cent recovered quickly to reach 8.0 per cent in 2009-10 and 8.5 per cent in 2010-11 
under the impact of stimulus measures as also the inherent strength of domestic 
demand. Strong recovery in demand, along with persistent supply pressures, 
however, led to inflationary pressures during 2010-2011.  
e. Why was the impact on India muted? 
33. Despite its immediate impact on the financial markets and the trade flows, the 
crisis did not have very significant impact on the Indian financial system.  The 
Page 18 of 28 
 reasons for the muted impact is attributable primarily to (i) the macroprudential 
approach to regulation (ii) multiple indicator based monetary policy, (iii) calibrated 
capital account management, (iv) management of systemic interconnectedness, (v) 
robust market infrastructure for OTC transactions and (vi) a conservative approach 
towards financial innovation.  
34. The monetary policy formulation by the Reserve Bank of India has been 
guided by multiple objectives and multiple instruments contrary to the approach 
followed by some countries of single objective and single instruments.  Monitoring of 
multiple macroeconomic indicators has helped the Reserve Bank in interpreting 
developments in financial system and taking prompt corrective action.  Similarly, 
measures such as putting in place robust systems for reducing counterparty risk in 
OTC transactions through CCP arrangements and regulation of shadow banking 
institutions to address the interconnectedness issues have helped in containing the 
impact of the crisis and helping the economy keep afloat despite the huge global 
turbulences.  
III. Metamorphosis of the crisis into Sovereign Debt Crisis:  
35. Just when the global economy was reverting to the normalcy, another crisis in 
the nature of sovereign debt crisis surfaced.  The growing debts of many European 
sovereigns caused sustainability concerns forcing investors to withdraw from these 
markets which led to significant escalation of their CDS spreads.  The crisis which 
emerged in late 2009 has engulfed the entire Eurozone by end 2011.  While only 
Greek bonds had CDS spreads higher than 200 bps in April 2010, by Jan 2012, 
bonds of all countries except Germany, Finland and the Netherlands had CDS 
spreads higher than 200 bps.  In fact, bonds of PIIGS countries (Portugal, Italy, 
Ireland, Greece and Spain) had CDS spreads even higher than 400 bps.

36. The combination of sluggish activity, bailouts and fiscal stimulus measures 
have led to ballooning of fiscal deficits and public debt/GDP ratios in major advanced 
economies and have raised concerns over fiscal sustainability. These concerns are 
most visible in euro area countries, which were plagued by various combinations of 
problems such as over-large banking sector that had become exposed to a housing 
boom and bust, an uncompetitive economy signaled by repeated current account 
6
deficits, and a bloated state sector with high private-sector unemployment . For 
example, fiscal deficit/GDP ratios of advanced economies jumped from a near 
balance position (deficit of 0.6 per cent) in 2007 to 9.0 per cent in 2009, with that of 
the US jumping from 2.7 per cent to 13.0 per cent over the same period. Fiscal 
deficits of emerging economies also rose, albeit relatively modestly, from a surplus of 
0.1 per cent in 2007 to a deficit 4.8 per cent in 2009. The public debt/GDP ratio for 
advanced economies increased from 73.4 per cent in 2007 to 93.7 per cent in 2009

 and further to 103.5 per cent in 2011. The ratios for Emerging Market Economies 
(EMEs) over the same years were almost unchanged at 35.9 per cent, 36.7 per cent 
and 37.8 per cent.  
37. The sovereign debt crisis, in a way has completed the circle- during the Global 
crisis 2007 the impact spread from banking system to sovereigns while in the current 
crisis, the impact is in the reverse direction, from sovereigns to banks.  What makes 
the present crisis more disturbing is, in the Global crisis, when banks were under 
stress there was a backstop in the nature of sovereigns, but now sovereigns 
themselves are on the verge of default leaving everyone wonder as to what could be 
a backstop for a sovereign default. 
 
 Impact of sovereign debt crisis on global economy: 
38. The current crisis has jeopardized the recovery plans put in place by 
regulators, policy makers and the sovereigns post global crisis. Despite the source 
and the immediate impact being localized in Eurozone, the knock on effects of the 
crisis are felt all across the globe.  Financial conditions have deteriorated, growth 
prospects dimmed and downside risks have escalated.   IMF’s World Economic 
Outlook has revised the Global output growth downwards to 3.25 per cent with the 
Euro area economy expected to go into a mild recession in 2012 as result of rise in 
sovereign yields, the effects of bank leveraging and the impact of additional fiscal 
consolidation.  The EDEs are also expected to post lower growth on account of 
worsening external environment and a weakening internal demand.   
39. Heightened risk aversion and deleveraging induced by the euro area crisis 
impacted financial markets across the globe. Despite European Union’s 
announcement of significant policy actions during December 2011, the financial 
Page 21 of 28 
 markets continued to reel under stress in the backdrop of rating downgrade of 
European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) and nine euro area countries by S&P, of 
which four were downgraded by two notches. The CDS spreads and yields of 
sovereign debts in the euro area have increased substantially during the recent 
period. The inter-bank LIBOR market has been witnessing growing stress in terms of 
declining volume, rising rates and shortening of tenor of lending.  The USD LIBOR-
OIS spread and EURIBOR-OIS spread have widened significantly implying increased 
counterparty credit risk premium. The equity markets across the globe have 
witnessed sharp fall with increased volatility.  
40. As regards the banking system, in countries directly impacted by the 
sovereign debt crisis such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, there was a persistent 
slowdown in bank credit through 2011.  In countries peripherally affected by the crisis 
such as France and Germany, the credit growth which was showing signs of revival 
in 2010, has dipped again reflecting the impact of the deepening of the sovereign 
debt crisis.  The asset quality, as reflected in NPL ratios, continued to deteriorate in 
Eurozone countries.  
41. Apart from raising credit risks, the sovereign crisis has also increased funding 
risks for Euro zone banks. As per an analysis by the Bank for International 
Settlements (BIS), banks in Greece, Ireland and Portugal have increasingly found it 
difficult to raise wholesale debt and deposits, and have become reliant on central 
7
bank liquidity. The increase in the cost of wholesale funding has also partially 
affected banks in other European countries.

July. 
 
Page 22 of 28 
 42. According to the BIS, there are, broadly, four channels through which 
sovereign risk affect banks’ funding costs, given the pervasive role of government 
debt in the financial system. 
i. First, losses associated with government debt weaken balance sheets of 
banks making funding more costly and difficult to obtain.  
ii. Second, higher sovereign risks reduce the value of the collateral that banks 
can use to raise wholesale funding and central bank liquidity.  
iii. Third, sovereign rating downgrades generally flow through to lower ratings for 
domestic banks as banks are more likely than other sectors to be affected by 
sovereign distress. As the banks’ credit ratings decline, their wholesale 
funding costs rise.  
iv. Fourth, a weakening of the sovereign reduces the funding benefits that banks 
could derive from implicit and explicit government guarantees. 
 
Impact of sovereign debt crisis on India:  
43. With the euro area appearing to head for a recession and the global growth 
slowing again after a short recovery, growth in India too has moderated more than 
was expected earlier.  Increase in global uncertainty, weak industrial growth, slow 
down in investment activity and deceleration in the resource flow to commercial 
sector led to dip in output growth.  Inflation risks emanating from suppressed 
domestic energy prices, incomplete pass-through of rupee depreciation and slippage 
in fiscal deficit,  further fuelled by food and commodity inflation have led to policy 
tightening.  All these factors have resulted in the growth projection for India for 2011-
12 being revised downwards from 7.6 per cent to 6.9 per cent. 
Page 23 of 28 
 44. Indian banking system has, however, not been impacted by current crisis as it 
does not have any significant presence in countries impacted by the current crisis nor 
Indian banks have any significant exposures to bonds issued by them. While there is 
no first order impact of the sovereign debt crisis, there could, however, be second-
order impact through various channels including trade. There could be funding 
constraints for Indian bank branches operating overseas if European banks 
deleverage.  The cost of borrowing for banks and corporates may, therefore, go up 
leading to concerns over refinancing foreign currency liabilities.  Due to the slump in 
the overseas demand and the associated downturn in investment activity, there has 
already been some sluggishness in the credit as well as asset growth of Indian 
banking sector during 2011-12.   
45. The crisis also had a measurable impact on the Indian financial markets, with 
equity prices witnessing sharp decline on account of large net sales by FIIs  in the 
backdrop of worsening macroeconomic environment and bearish outlook on earning 
growth of Indian corporates. Further, moderation in capital flow coupled with 
widening trade deficit led to a sharp fall in the INR-USD exchange rate to touch an all 
time low of 54.30 on December 15, 2011.  
46. Reserve Bank has taken a number of measures to contain the excessive 
volatility in the foreign exchange market. The prudential measures undertaken with a 
view to contain speculative activities included disallowing rebooking of cancelled 
forward transactions (involving the Rupee as one of the currencies which are booked 
to hedge current account transactions regardless of the tenor and capital account 
transactions falling due within one year), , reduction in Net Overnight Open Position 
Limits of Authorised Dealer (AD) banks, curtailment in limit for cancellation of forward 
contracts booked on the basis of past performance route by the importers, prohibiting 
Page 24 of 28 
 passing of exchange gains to the customers on cancellation of forward contracts 
booked under past performance route, disallowing FIIs to rebook cancelled forward 
contracts, stipulating all cash/tom/spot transactions to be delivery/ remittance based. 
With a view to encouraging inflows, measures such as raising the limits on FII 
investments in debt securities, further liberalisation of ECB policy, relaxation of 
interest rate ceilings on NRE and NRO deposits, have been taken.

IV. Takeaways from the Crisis: 
47. Notwithstanding the risk of sounding cliché’ I cannot contain myself to remind 
you that every cloud has a silver lining and every crisis brings with it, a lesson.  The 
Global crisis 2007 and the current sovereign debt crisis offer, in fact, many lessons 
and the analysts are busy deciphering one each day.  While there are many 
regulatory and policy lessons that have come to the fore and are under various 
stages of implementation, I would flag some takeaways which would be most 
relevant for you as you prepare to enter into the professional world which is currently 
beset with crises.   
Takeaway 1:  Too much of anything is bad 
48. You must have often heard your grandmother saying this and, mind you, this 
remains relevant even today, in fact more today, post crisis.  Too much of leverage, 
too much of liquidity, too much of complexity and too much of greed-   they all have 
led to the crisis.  It is now being argued that too much of finance is also not 
8
conducive to growth.  Recent studies suggest that while at low levels a larger 
financial system leads to higher productivity, beyond a point, more banking and more 
credit result in lower growth.  Further, it is also argued that fast growing financial 
sector can be detrimental to the aggregate productivity growth.  Moderation in 
approach, therefore, is an important lesson.   
 
Takeaway 2:  Models are not absolute

 Cecchetti, Stephan and Kharroubi, Enisse (Jan 2012), ‘Reassessing the impact of finance on growth’ 
Page 26 of 28 
 49. In the run up to the crisis, there was an excessive reliance and almost a blind 
faith that models convey absolute truths.  Entire risk management systems were built 
around this belief.  Post crisis, participants have woken up to the harsh reality that 
models do not fully reflect the realities of life and excessive reliance on quantitative 
models is fraught with risk.  Exact sciences such as physics are governed by nature’s 
laws that are immutable and lead to definite and predictable results.  Finance on the 
other hand, is governed by capricious human behavior and biases which cannot be 
easily modeled.   To an argument that models with all their limitations are better than 
not having any, Nassim Taleb has said “ You are worse of relying on misleading 
information than on not having any information at all.  If you give a pilot an altimeter 
that is sometimes defective he will crash the plane. Give him nothing and he will look 
out the window”.   Knowing the shortcomings of the models is, therefore, extremely 
important for their judicious usage.  
 
Takeaway 3:  Finance should serve the real sector and not the converse 
50. While it is agreed that financial system furthers the economic development by 
enabling efficient allocation of capital and risk, the ultimate objective of finance, 
which is the furthering of economic development should not be lost sight of.  In the 
period prior to crisis, the financial activity grew so much that the umbilical cord 
between financial and real sectors was severed and the finance started to exist for its 
own sake.  The dangers of such a scenario have been quite emphatically conveyed 
by the Crisis. 
 
51. With these thoughts, I conclude my address.  I thank you all for your patient 
hearing and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
