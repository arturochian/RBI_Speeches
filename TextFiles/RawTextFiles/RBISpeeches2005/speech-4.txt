Taking Banking Services to the Common Man –
Financial Inclusion *
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am truly honoured to deliver the Fedbank Hormis Memorial Foundation
commemorative lecture. The illustrious list of the previous years’ speakers
indicates the kind of significance this commemorative lecture has acquired over the
years. The late Shri K.P.Hormis, founder of Federal Bank, was a visionary and left
behind an institutional set up in the form of Federal Bank which has been doing
yeoman service for well over seventy five years. The Fedbank Hormis Memorial
Foundation, a public charitable trust, has been furthering the cause of banking and
finance by providing knowledge and training in the areas of banking, finance,
economics and management to banking professionals as well as deserving
students who are specializing in these areas. As the life and times of late Shri
K.P.Hormis were spent largely in taking banking to the masses, which is indicated
by Federal Bank’s mix of urban and rural coverage, I thought it would be
appropriate for me to speak on taking banking services to the common man –
financial inclusion, a topic of contemporary significance and relevance.
The banking industry has shown tremendous growth in volume and complexity
during the last few decades. Despite making significant improvements in all the
areas relating to financial viability, profitability and competitiveness, there are
concerns that banks have not been able to include vast segment of the population,
especially the underprivileged sections of the society, into the fold of basic banking
services. Internationally also efforts are being made to study the causes of
financial exclusion and designing strategies to ensure financial inclusion of the
poor and disadvantaged. The reasons may vary from country to country and hence
the strategy could also vary but all out efforts are being made as financial inclusion
can truly lift the financial condition and standards of life of the poor and the
disadvantaged.

* Commemorative Lecture by Shri V.Leeladhar, Deputy Governor Reserve bank of India at
the Fedbank Hormis Memorial Foundation at Ernakulam on December 2, 20053. What is Financial Inclusion?
• Financial inclusion is delivery of banking services at an affordable
cost to the vast sections of disadvantaged and low income groups.
Unrestrained access to public goods and services is the sine qua non
of an open and efficient society. As banking services are in the
nature of public good, it is essential that availability of banking and
payment services to the entire population without discrimination is the
prime objective of the public policy.
4. The scope of financial inclusion
The scope of financial inclusion can be expanded in two ways.
(a) through state-driven intervention by way of statutory enactments ( for
instance the US example, the Community Reinvestment Act and making
it a statutory right to have bank account in France).
(b) through voluntary effort by the banking community itself for evolving
various strategies to bring within the ambit of the banking sector the
large strata of society.
When bankers do not give the desired attention to certain areas, the regulators
have to step in to remedy the situation. This is the reason why the Reserve Bank of
India is placing a lot of emphasis on financial inclusion.
In India the focus of the financial inclusion at present is confined to ensuring a bare
minimum access to a savings bank account without frills, to all. Internationally, the
financial exclusion has been viewed in a much wider perspective. Having a current
account / savings account on its own, is not regarded as an accurate indicator of
financial inclusion. There could be multiple levels of financial inclusion and
exclusion. At one extreme, it is possible to identify the ‘super-included’, i.e., those
customers who are actively and persistently courted by the financial services
industry, and who have at their disposal a wide range of financial services and
products. At the other extreme, we may have the financially excluded, who are
denied access to even the most basic of financial products. In between are thosewho use the banking services only for deposits and withdrawals of money. But
these persons may have only restricted access to the financial system, and may
not enjoy the flexibility of access offered to more affluent customers.
5. Consequences of Financial Exclusion
Consequences of financial exclusion will vary depending on the nature and extent
of services denied. It may lead to increased travel requirements, higher incidence
of crime, general decline in investment, difficulties in gaining access to credit or
getting credit from informal sources at exorbitant rates, and increased
unemployment, etc.  The small business may suffer due to loss of access to middle
class and higher-income consumers, higher cash handling costs, delays in
remittances of money.  According to certain researches, financial exclusion can
lead to social exclusion.
6. International experience in promoting financial inclusion
An interesting feature which emerges from the international practice is that the
more developed the society is, the greater the thrust on empowerment of the
common person and low income groups. It may be worthwhile to have a look at the
international experience in tackling the problem of financial exclusion so that we
can learn from the international experience.
The Financial Inclusion Task Force in UK has identified three priority areas for the
purpose of financial inclusion,  viz., access to banking, access to affordable credit
and access to free face-to-face money advice. UK has established a Financial
Inclusion Fund to promote financial inclusion and assigned responsibility to banks
and credit unions in removing financial exclusion. Basic bank no frills accounts
have been introduced. An enhanced legislative environment for credit unions has
been established, accompanied by tighter regulations to ensure greater protection
for investors. A Post Office Card Account (POCA) has been created for those
who are unable or unwilling to access a basic bank account. The concept of a
Savings Gateway has been piloted. This offers those on low-income employment
£1 from the state for every £1 they invest, up to a maximum of £25 per month. In
addition the Community Finance Learning Initiatives (CFLIs) were alsointroduced with a view to promoting basic financial literacy among housing
association tenants.
A civil rights law, namely Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in the United States
prohibits discrimination by banks against low and moderate income
neighborhoods. The CRA imposes an affirmative and continuing obligations on
banks to serve the needs for credit and banking services of all the communities in
which they are chartered.  In fact, numerous studies conducted by Federal
Reserve and Harvard University demonstrated that CRA lending is a win-win
proposition and profitable to banks. In this context, it is also interesting to know the
other initiative taken by a state in the United States. Apart from the CRA
experiment, armed with the sanction of Banking Law, the State of New York
Banking Department, with the objective of making available the low cost banking
services to consumers, made mandatory that each banking institution shall offer
basic banking account and in case of credit unions the basic share draft account,
which is in the nature of low cost account with minimum facilities.  Some key
features of the basic banking account are worth-mentioning here.
• the initial deposit amount required to open the account shall not
exceed US $ 25
• the minimum balance, including any average balance, required to
maintain such account shall not exceed US $ 0.10
• the charge for periodic cycle for the maintenance of such accounts to be
declared up front
• the minimum number of withdrawal transactions which may be made
during any periodic cycle at no charge to the account holder must at least
be eight
• a withdrawal shall be deemed to be made when recorded on the
books of the account holder’s banking institution
• except, as provided below, an account holder shall not be 
restricted as to the number of deposits which may be made to the
account without incurring any additional charge• the banking institution may charge account holders for transactions at
electronic facilities which are not operated by the account holder’s banking
institution as well as other fees and charges for specific banking services
which are not covered under the basic banking account scheme
• every periodic statement issued for the basic banking account should
invariably cover on it or by way of separate communiqué maximum
number of withdrawals permitted during each periodic cycle without
additional charge and the consequences of exceeding such maximum and
the fee if any, for the use of electronic facilities which are not operated by 
the account holder’s banking institution.
An interesting feature of basic banking account scheme is the element of
transparency i.e. the banking institution should, prior to opening the account,
furnish a written disclosure to the account holder describing the main features of
the scheme i.e. the initial deposit amount required to open the account, minimum
balance to be maintained, charge per periodic cycle for use of such account,
maximum number of withdrawal transactions without any additional charge and
other charges imposed on transactions for availing electronic facility not operated
by the account holder’s banking institution, etc.
7. Indian Scenario
Bank nationalization in India marked a paradigm shift in the focus of banking as it
was intended to shift the focus from class banking to mass banking. The rationale
for creating Regional Rural Banks was also to take the banking services to poor
people.  The branches of commercial banks and the RRBs have increased from
8321 in the year 1969 to 68,282 branches as at the end of March 2005. The
average population per branch office has decreased from 64,000 to 16,000 during
the same period. However, there are certain under-banked states such as Bihar,
Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and a
large number of North-Eastern states, where the average population per branch
office continues to be quite high compared to the national average. As you would
be aware, the new branch authorization policy of Reserve Bank encourages banksto open branches in these under banked states and the under banked areas in
other states. The new policy also places a lot of emphasis on the efforts made by
the Bank to achieve, inter alia, financial inclusion and other policy objectives.
One of the benchmarks employed to assess the degree of reach of financial
services to the population of the country, is the quantum of deposit accounts
(current and savings) held as a ratio to the adult population. In the Indian context,
taking into account the Census of 2001 (ignoring the incremental growth of
population thereafter), the ratio of deposit accounts (data available as on March
31, 2004) to the total adult population was only 59% (details furnished in the table).
Within the country, there is a wide variation  across states. For instance, the ratio
for the state of Kerala is as high as 89% while Bihar is marked by a low coverage
of 33%. In the North Eastern States like Nagaland and Manipur, the coverage was
a meager 21% and 27%, respectively.  The Northern Region, comprising the states
of Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, has a high coverage ratio of 84%. Compared to
the developed world, the coverage of our financial services is quite low. For
instance, as per a recent survey commissioned by British Bankers' Association, 92
to 94% of the population of UK has either current or savings bank account.
8. Steps towards financial inclusion
In the context of initiatives taken for extending banking services to the small man,
the mode of financial sector development until 1980’s was characterized by
• a hugely expanded bank branch and cooperative network and new
organizational forms like RRBs;
• a greater focus on credit rather than other financial services like
savings and insurance, although the banks and cooperatives did
provide deposit facilities;
• lending targets directed at a range of ‘priority sectors’ such as
agriculture, weaker sections of the population, etc;
• interest rate ceilings;• significant government subsidies channeled through the banks and
cooperatives, as well as through related government programmes;
• a dominant perspective that finance for rural and poor people was a
social obligation and not a potential business opportunity.
It is absolutely beyond any doubt that the financial access to masses has
significantly improved in the last three and a half decades. But the basic question
is, has that been good enough. As I mentioned earlier, the quantum of deposit
accounts (current and savings) held as a ratio to the adult population has not been
uniformly encouraging. There is a tremendous scope for financial coverage if we
have to improve the standards of life of those deprived people.
With a view to enhancing the financial inclusion, as a proactive measure, the  RBI
in its Annual Policy Statement for the year 2005-06, while recognizing the concerns
in regard to the banking practices that tend to exclude rather than attract vast
sections of population, urged banks to review their existing practices to align them
with the objective of financial inclusion. In the Mid Term Review of the Policy
(2005-06),  RBI exhorted the banks, with a view to achieving greater financial
inclusion, to make available a basic banking  ‘no frills’ account either with nil or
very minimum balances as well as charges that would make such accounts
accessible to vast sections of the population. The nature and number of
transactions in such accounts would be restricted and made known to customers in
advance in a transparent manner. All banks are urged to give wide publicity to the
facility of such no frills account so as to ensure greater financial inclusion.
Further, in order to ensure that persons belonging to low income group both in
urban and rural areas do not face difficulty in opening the bank accounts due to the
procedural hassles, the KYC procedure for opening accounts has been simplified
for those persons who intend to keep balances not exceeding rupees fifty thousand
(Rs. 50,000/-) in all their accounts taken together and the total credit in all the
accounts taken together is not expected to exceed rupees one lakh (Rs.1,00,000/-)
in a year.9. The Way Forward
The banks should come out of inhibited feeling that very aggressive competition
policy and social inclusion are mutually exclusive. As demonstrated elsewhere,
the mass banking with no-frills etc. can become a win-win situation for both.
Basically banking services need to be “marketed” to connect with large
population segments and these may be justifiable promotional costs. The
opportunities are plenty.
• In the context of India becoming one of the largest micro finance markets in
the world especially in the growth of women’s savings and credit groups
(SHGs) and the sustaining success of such institutions which has been
demonstrated by the success of SEWA bank in Gujarat, low cost banking is
not necessarily an unviable venture/proposition.
• The IBA may explore the possibility of a survey about the coverage in
respect of financial inclusion keeping in view the geographical spread of the
banks and extent of financial services available to the population so as to
assess the constraints in extension of financial services to hitherto
unbanked sections and for initiating appropriate policy measures.
• It may be useful for banks to consider franchising with other segments of
financial sector such as cooperatives, RRBs etc. so as to extend the scope
of financial inclusion with minimal intermediation cost.
• Since large sections of low income groups transactions are related to
deposits and withdrawals, with a view to containing transaction costs,
'simple to use' cash dispensing and collecting machines akin to ATMs, with
operating instructions and commands in vernacular would greatly facilitate
financial inclusion of the semi urban and rural populace. In this regard, it is
worthwhile to emulate the example of ‘e-Choupal’ project brought forth
through private sector initiative.Conclusion
It is becoming increasingly apparent that addressing financial exclusion will require
a holistic approach on the part of the banks in creating awareness about financial
products, education, and advice on money management, debt counseling, savings
and affordable credit. The banks would have to evolve specific strategies to
expand the outreach of their services in order to promote financial inclusion. One
of the ways in which this can be achieved in a cost-effective manner is through
forging linkages with microfinance institutions and local communities. Banks should
give wide publicity to the facility of no frills account. Technology can be a very
valuable tool in providing access to banking products in remote areas. ATMs cash
dispensing machines can be modified suitably to make them user friendly for
people who are illiterate, less educated or do not know English.
To sum up, banks need to redesign their business strategies to incorporate specific
plans to promote financial inclusion of low income group treating it both a business
opportunity as well as a corporate social responsibility. They have to make use of
all available resources including technology and expertise available with them as
well as the MFIs and NGOs. It may appear in the first instance that  taking banking
to the sections constituting “the bottom of the pyramid”, may not be profitable but it
should always be remembered that even the relatively low margins on high
volumes can be a very profitable proposition. Financial inclusion can emerge as
commercial profitable business. Only the banks should be prepared to think
outside the box!Coverage of Banking Services (Ratio of Demand Deposit Accounts to the adult
