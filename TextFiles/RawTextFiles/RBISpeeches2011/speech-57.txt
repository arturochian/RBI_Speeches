Striking the Balance between Growth and Inflation in India
 
(Presentation by Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 
US-India Economic and Financial Partnership: CII and Brookings Institution, 
Washington DC, 27 June 2011) 
 
I. Introduction 
The Indian economy recovered relatively quickly from the financial crisis of 2008, but 
inflationary pressures emerged even in the early stages of the recovery in late 2009. 
Over the past year and a half, the challenge for monetary policy has been to contain 
these inflationary pressures without disrupting the recovery. The economy grew by 8.5 
per cent in the fiscal year 2010-11, which is close to the five-year average pre-crisis, but 
year-end headline inflation was over 9 per cent, well above tolerance limits. Meanwhile, 
global developments have implications for both growth and inflation trajectories in India 
over the coming months. In this presentation, I propose to talk about the key global and 
domestic factors that are shaping our growth and inflation outlook, as a backdrop to 
discussing monetary policy actions and their impact. I will then briefly talk about 
challenges to communication. 
II. Global Forces 
There are widespread perceptions and increasing concerns about the recovery in the 
advanced economies losing momentum. High energy prices appear to be feeding into a 
negative cycle of persistent unemployment and depressed housing prices in the US and 
UK, while the prospect of sovereign default and its real and financial consequences 
dominates the European policy discussion. In contrast, emerging Market Economies 
(EMEs) are showing symptoms of demand-driven inflationary pressures, which have, 
over the past several months, been exacerbated by rising global commodity prices.  
Apart from all the other things that are going on in the global environment, commodity 
prices have played a key role in India's inflation over this period. Consequently, their 
likely trajectory is going to be an important factor in influencing India's inflation path.  
Charts 1 and Chart 2 provide some perspective on this. They display the correlations 
between the build-up of non-commercial long positions in four commodities - crude oil, 
copper, cotton and soya beans - and price movements. It appears that that trading

 positions, possibly driven by abundant liquidity, are contributing to recent price 
escalations, except in cotton, where temporary supply disruptions have been the main 
factor. Significantly, in recent weeks, there has been a reversal in long positions, which 
in turn is associated with softening of prices. If this trend persists, it will provide 
substantial relief for global inflation management, particularly for large commodity 
importers, including India. Further, although hardly a desirable way to control inflation, 
slowing global growth, in addition to reinforcing these favourable commodity price 
trends, will also help to moderate demand and keep capacity utilization low. This will 
contribute to moderating inflationary pressures coming from traded or tradable goods. 
III. Domestic Growth Prospects 
2010-11 was a year in which the economy continued its recovery from the impact of the 
financial crisis. Growth bottomed out at 6.8 per cent in 2008-09, the crisis year, picked 
up to 8 per cent in 2009-10 and further to 8.5 per cent in 2010-11. Chart 3 shows two 
pictures of the growth trajectory. With reference to aggregate and sectoral Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) estimates, the trajectory in the graph suggests that the 
momentum is moderating somewhat, as the most recent quarters show decelerating 
year-on-year growth rates. The main contributor to this tendency is the industrial sector, 
which has shown relatively high volatility over the period displayed. It slowed 
significantly during the crisis, recovered sharply subsequently and has recently begun to 
slow down. 
Looking at the industrial sector a little more closely, the graph displaying trends in 
industrial production provide some clues to its dynamics. The most volatile segments of 
the index, both of which are displayed on the graph, are capital goods and consumer 
durables. These are generally seen as being the most interest-sensitive components of 
the index and their recent trends suggest that the impact of contractionary monetary 
policy is having an impact. Along with softening commodity prices, this trend will 
contribute to bringing inflation under control, by helping moderate demand pressures. Of 
course, industry associations, including Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), have 
been consistent critics of the monetary policy stance, arguing that it is slowing growth 
without really impacting inflation, which is being driven by supply side pressures. I will 
address this critique both in the discussion on inflation and the one on communication. 
In short, the domestic growth scenario suggests that the growth rate will moderate 
somewhat in the coming year. The Reserve Bank of India projects growth during 2011-
12 to be 8 per cent in its baseline scenario. From the inflation management perspective, 
this is not an entirely undesirable outcome. If it results in a significant reduction in the 
inflation rate, it will represent a soft landing, which in turn opens up the opportunity for a 
reversal in the interest rate cycle. However, many unknowns stand in the way and 
ultimately, inflation outcomes will determine the monetary stance.

IV. Domestic Inflation Dynamics 
Over the past year, the nature of inflation has changed in significant ways. Chart 4 
provides a broad picture of the dynamics. Headline inflation began to accelerate in the 
second half of 2009-10, at a time when growth was still relatively sluggish. It stayed high 
through 2010-11, actually accelerating in the last quarter of the year. In the first two 
months of 2011-12, that pattern has persisted. However, the relative importance of the 
drivers of inflation clearly changed over the period displayed. Food inflation was the 
predominant contributor in the early phase, but a resurgence of energy prices in the 
post-crisis environment began to play an increasingly important role. The prices of non-
food manufactured products, which the RBI views as a reflection of demand pressures, 
began to rise noticeably in early 2010, but saw their rate of increase stabilize and even 
moderate somewhat in the third quarter of 2010-11. However, that pattern was short-
lived and the rate of inflation for this category surged in the fourth quarter, a momentum 
that has clearly persisted into the current year. 
The changing contributions of different drivers are very sharply brought out in the 
decomposition exercise displayed in Chart 5. The analysis looked at recent patterns in 
terms of three periods of roughly equal lengths over the past 14 months, beginning April 
2010. In the first period, food and energy, reflecting classic supply-side forces, were the 
primary contributors to inflation. Non-food manufacturing inflation, which, to the extent 
that it represents demand pressures, was not insignificant, suggesting that pricing 
power was present. In the second period, the weight of the contribution shifted 
dramatically towards commodities other than energy. The contribution from food 
moderated a bit, as did that from non-food manufacturing, suggesting that the pass-
through or "generalization" risk was moderating. However, this pattern was short-lived. 
In the last period, energy returned as a major contributor and the sharp increase in the 
contribution of non-food manufacturing indicated that producers were able to pass on 
higher input costs without too much difficulty. The strength of the pass-through in this 
period indicated that demand conditions remained quite robust, even as some early 
signs of moderation were coming through the production estimates and feedback from 
industry.  
I want to put particular emphasis on food price dynamics, as I believe that this is likely to 
be a significant factor in the medium term. Although the overall contribution of food to 
inflation moderated over the past year, there are structural demand-supply imbalances 
at work, which will keep the pressure up in the absence of large and sustainable 
increases in supply. This phenomenon is demonstrated in the graph in Chart 6. The 
main point that the graph makes is that the prices of protein sources have deviated 
sharply from their trend in recent years and show no signs of reverting to it. By contrast, 
3 
 the prices of other foods have also shown periodic deviations from trend, but have 
generally reverted. This pattern has, of course contributed to high volatility, as the Chart 
also demonstrates.  
Volatility in food prices does have a welfare-reducing impact, but in the current Indian 
context, the much greater concern is the long-term nutritional impact of elevated protein 
prices. At a time when the combined impact of demographic transition and income 
increases is generating enormous demand for proteins, the supply chain is clearly 
struggling to meet this demand. 
To conclude this part of the discussion, let me bring in the issue of inflationary 
expectations. The persistence and recent acceleration of inflation has clearly increased 
the risk of expectations becoming unanchored. The RBI monitors short-term 
expectations through household surveys. Recent surveys have reinforced the 
perception that household expectations are moving up. Food prices play an important 
role in this process, but whatever the causes, the impact on wage-setting in both explicit 
and implicit contracts cannot be dismissed. However, the relative stability of long-term 
(10-year) yields on government securities suggest that expectations over this horizon 
remain anchored. This is reinforced by our regular surveys of professional forecasters, 
which also indicate no loss of confidence in a moderate inflation scenario over the 
medium and long run. 
 
V. Monetary Policy: Actions and Transmission 
The current cycle of contractionary monetary policy was initiated in the context of two 
important factors.  First, there was an enormous volume of liquidity in the domestic 
financial system, as a result of policy responses to the crisis, which also took policy 
rates to very low levels. Second, even as the early signs of recovery were visible, 
inflationary tendencies had also begun to show. All this was happening in a global 
environment which was still quite turbulent and uncertain in late 2009 and early 2010. 
Chart 7 shows the trajectory of policy instruments - the Repo, the Reverse Repo and 
the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) in the pre-crisis, crisis and recovery periods.  
In contrast to the very sharp and quick actions on rates and liquidity that were taken in 
responding to the crisis, the recovery has been characterized by a much more 
calibrated approach. This was motivated by considerations related to the factors that I 
mentioned earlier. A more aggressive response to the incipient inflationary pressures 
may have been warranted under somewhat more predictable domestic growth and 
global scenarios, but in both these respects the situation in early 2010 was nowhere 
near stable or predictable. A calibrated approach, which was essentially a relatively 
4 
 frequent series of small rate hikes, was seen as the best way to balance the potentially 
conflicting objectives.  
In the early phase of the cycle, surplus liquidity conditions persisted, which, clearly 
made transmission of policy rates through to transaction rates very sluggish. From this 
perspective, the early actions were essentially a signaling effort, accompanied by 
steady moves to eliminate the liquidity surplus through CRR increases. By the middle of 
the 2010, the liquidity scenario had moved to a deficit and transmission became much 
stronger. Chart 8 shows the immediate impact on the call rate, which is effectively the 
operating target of monetary policy, of a change in the liquidity situation. The 
strengthening of transmission was visible across a variety of financial market segments. 
Charts 9 and Chart 10 provide some illustrative evidence of this.  
In Chart 9, the call and Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Operations (CBLO) rates, 
a secured short-term channel of liquidity management, are shown with reference to the 
repo-reverse repo corridor. The transmission intensity is quite clear, with the added 
dimension of movement from the lower bound of the corridor to the upper bound, as 
liquidity conditions tightened. Chart 10 shows the yield on 10-year government 
securities and that on 5-year AAA corporate bonds from the same perspective. 
Transmission is visible here as well. 
Of course, the banking system is by far the more important intermediary in the Indian 
financial context and what banks do matters a great deal. Significantly, a similar 
analysis of transmission through bank lending rates does not suggest that it is as strong 
as that in markets. Chart 11 displays the dynamics of bank lending rates in response to 
policy rate changes in both the expansionary and contractionary cycles. The 
sensitivities do not appear to be very strong. Rates did not come down very sharply in 
the expansionary phase and, while they are increasing in the contractionary phase, the 
magnitudes appear to be small. Aggregation problems may be masking some of the 
impact. In the RBI's consultations with industry, the fact that banks are aggressively 
passing on rate increases is often alluded to, which is undoubtedly intended as a 
complaint, but is entirely consistent with monetary policy objectives. 
Finally, in the context of monetary actions and transmission, let me address the issue of 
real rates. One consistent critique of the monetary stance, that it has been behind the 
curve, is based on the criterion that real rates have been and still are negative. Of 
course, this leads to a usually inconclusive debate on what the deflator should be, but 
widespread perceptions that real rates are negative are likely to impact both spending 
behaviour and expectations. This then leads to the more operational issue of whether 
rates are to be brought into positive territory relatively rapidly or gradually. 
5 
 Charts 12 and Charts 13 provide some perspective on the real rate issue. As Chart 12 
shows, with the recent acceleration in inflation, many real rates, measured in the 
simplest way of subtracting either current headline inflation or core inflation from the 
nominal rate, are negative when the headline rate is used to deflate. The picture 
changes, but hardly decisively, if the core (non-food manufacturing) inflation is used. 
So, going by some of these indicators,  it may appear that the policy stance is not 
contractionary enough. However, when we look at some other measures of real rates, 
specifically bank lending rates as depicted in Chart 13, the picture is a little different. 
Allowing for differences in risk and other differentiating prices, real rates are significantly 
positive. As I said, this is a criterion on which the debate in the Indian context is yet 
unresolved and is keeping some of my colleagues in the research departments 
engaged. The point I would like to make is that, at least in terms of a large proportion of 
financial transactions, real rates are positive. It remains a matter of judgment whether 
they are lower than they should be and, if so, how quickly the necessary adjustment 
should be made.  
This judgment is partly related to the issue of expectations. Looking back over the past 
year and a half, the balancing act between growth and inflation can also be seen in a 
slightly different way. There is also a tradeoff between minimizing the sacrifice of growth 
and not letting expectations run out of control as a result of inflation persistence, 
exacerbated by new shocks.  
In the run-up to its recent Annual Policy statement, the RBI made an assessment that 
this had indeed emerged as a risk. Against a backdrop of firm and possibly rising 
commodity prices, the prospects of inflation going down soon were seen as not being 
very high. This supported the decision to send a stronger signal of commitment to 
bringing inflation under control. However, in our baseline projections, the cumulative 
impact of the tightening that has been done over the past few quarters - the call rate has 
moved up by about 450 basis points over a little more than a year - is likely to soften 
both growth and inflation in the second half of 2011-12. If this trajectory materialized as 
anticipated, the monetary stance could then respond accordingly. But, ultimately, as I 
indicated earlier, the stance is going to be predominantly determined by the actual and 
prospective inflation outcomes.  
 
VI. Issues of Communication 
This is an enormous challenge at the best of times, which becomes even more complex 
in circumstances like the current ones. Let me briefly address two sets of issues, to 
which a lot of thought is being given.  
6 
 First, there is the concern with forecasts going wrong. Having been an analyst in my 
previous position, I am quite used to making frequent changes in forecasts, as new 
information emerges. The difference in this position is that actual decisions, with huge 
national consequences have to be made on the basis of forecasts that might be very 
short-lived. This poses risks to credibility, because actions consistent with one forecast 
may not be equally so with the revised one. Apart from improvements in forecasting 
methodology, which is really a long-term process, there are immediate implications of 
this problem. One is to make better and more explicit assessments of alternative 
scenarios and then make policy decisions, taking into account the risks associated with 
different scenarios materializing. In effect, this is being done, but perhaps the 
communication strategy around it perhaps needs to be fine-tuned. 
Second, there is the issue of communicating the goals of monetary policy. For a variety 
of reasons, we have chosen not to commit to a formal and explicit inflation target, which 
has many advocates in the country. There is a credibility risk to not being held 
accountable to a single target, but there is also a risk to regularly missing that target, 
even if it is due to factors outside the control of monetary policy. But, that does not 
mean that some clear and, most importantly, achievable, goals should not be 
articulated. We attempt to do this with every policy statement and look very carefully at 
feedback and public comments and debate that appear to have read messages different 
from what we intended and how we can sharpen it. 
In this connection, the growth-inflation trade-off and sometimes conflicting perceptions 
of it is a significant issue. Going by theory and empirics, the trade-off is essentially a 
short-term one, with monetary policy aiming to keep growth at close to its long-term, 
structural trend as possible. Contractionary policy will slow growth down only to the 
extent that the economy is growing beyond its capacity, provoking inflation.  It cannot, in 
terms of this framework, have any significant impact on the trend rate of growth. In fact, 
long-term growth can only be helped, not hurt, by low and stable inflation. However, 
much of the debate tends to view any slowdown in growth resulting from an anti-
inflationary monetary stance as a long-term sacrifice, i.e., a downshift in trend. We need 
to articulate the distinctions involved more strongly, which has been done rather 
consciously in recent statements, but again perhaps needs to be sharpened. 
 
VII. Concluding Remarks 
The inflationary situation is India's most significant near-term macroeconomic challenge. 
There are some factors, global and domestic, that are clearly outside the purview of 
monetary influence. But, that doesn't mean that monetary policy does not have a role in 
addressing factors that it does influence - demand pressures and the risks of inflation 
7 
 becoming generalized through expectations and price-setting actions. To the extent that 
growth may be impacted, it must be understood as a short-term tradeoff, with positive 
consequences for long-term performance. Finally, the contribution of supply forces, 
which I have highlighted with the example of proteins, but which also exert pressure 
elsewhere, can only be addressed by increasing supply. Measures to do this are an 
integral part of a long-term inflation management strategy.   
I would like to thank CII and the Brookings Institution for inviting me to speak at this 
seminar and look forward to listening to the comments of the panelists and the 
participants.
