Policy initiatives since 1992 in thisregard have been directed at building strength and ensuring the safety and stability ofthe financial system. Compared to the experience of many developing countriesembarking on financial sector reform we have treaded cautiously and in an orderlyThis, however, should not lead to any complacency particularly in the context of thepresent fluidity of international capital markets and the increased vulnerability ofdeveloping economies to sharp fluctuations in macroeconomic situations.

What has been our experience of financial reforms so far? Where dowe stand in terms of financial stability considerations? What are the tasks  if theIndian financial system were to improve its competitive strength substantially andstrengthen itself to withstand the pressures of instability? What role should the bankThe significance of the financial system for an economy arises from at leastthree major sources. First, it performs various transformation functions relating tointermediation of funds in the economy. Secondly, it provides the mirror image of theunderlying real economy and the basic macro-economic balances. Thirdly, it is oneindustry whose basis of operation is underpinned in public trust.  The strength of thisbond between the banking system and people in general depends on how the financialviability of banking system is perceived.  The organisation and conduct of financialmarkets should be such that they reflect the underlying fundamentals of the economy.The financial system as a whole must remain sound and stable in order to enjoy a highUntil recently, the improvement in various transformation functions of theThe basic issue was how to create a competitive environment for the financial systemand to put in place a policy regime which would lead to improved allocative efficiencyof the financial sector and enhancement of saving and investment activities of theand matured, the two-way interaction between the financial and non-financial policiesgrew in importance. In the recent years, the increased market exposure of the financialsystem and its vulnerability to macro-economic shocks have highlighted the need forgreater internal controls and the need for strengthening prudential norms andregulations. In an environment of rising importance of cross border capital flows,perceptions and expectations play major roles in shaping events and this considerationcan be particularly heightened if the financial system is perceived to be weak andunsound.  It is not surprising that financial reform initiatives globally have now movedreform in the Union budget of 1991-92 to the Second Report of the NarasimhamCommittee in 1998, a considerable ground has been covered in putting in place afinancial system which can meet the requirements of a more competitive and openeconomy. By and large, financial reforms in India have proceeded in four majorFirst, setting the policy conditions right and removing the operationalconstraints of the financial system. What the reform process has tried to achieve is tolower the share of pre-empted resources in the total resources of the banking systemthrough gradual liberalisation of the cash reserve ratio and the statutory liquidity ratio.While the medium term target of 25 percent and 10 percent set for the CRR and SLR,respectively, have been, by and large, achieved, these ratio levels are still higher thanwhat would perhaps look ideal in the international context.

Although theimpact of such cycles on our banking system is quite limited, international experiencesuggests that, unless prudential measures are in place, banks can be potentiallyvulnerable to asset price pressures that can generate systemic risks for the financialThe fourth important element of reform concerns the “safety” aspects of thefinancial system. This is the core of the challenges facing the financial system atpresent. When the reform process was started in 1992, there was a massive problem ofcleaning the balance sheets of banks which had deteriorated over the years. Successivereform initiatives in this area have been aimed at prescribing certain prudentialstandards for the financial system and addressing certain structural weaknesses whichasset classification, meeting minimum capital adequacy standards throughrecapitalisation and devising a supervisory framework are steps in the direction ofThe key indicators of banking sector performance during the past few yearsmark certain noticeable changes. For example, the net profit of the scheduledcommercial banks as a percentage of their total assets has been turned around from anegative figure of -1.0 percent on an average during 1992-93 and 1993-94 to a positiveof 0.5 percent during 1994-95 to 1997-98. In the case of most public sector banks,business per employee and profit per employee have shown improvement in the recenthave achieved the minimum capital adequacy norm of 8 per cent.  The gross and netnon-performing assets of the banking system as percentage of advances have declinedto 16 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively, by March 1998.

The Narasimham Committee has presented adetailed analysis of various problems and challenges facing the Indian banking systemThe Indian banking system is still perceived as a relatively high cost banking.This is because of the relatively high operating cost of the banking system. Acomparative analysis indicates that while the average operating cost of banks as apercentage of assets was about 2.3 per cent in India during 1990-91 to 1995-96, it waslow at 1.1 per cent in China, 1.6 per cent in Malaysia, 1.9 per cent in Thailand, 1.0 percent in Japan and 2.1 per cent in G-10 Europe.  One of the major problems posed by arelatively high intermediation cost in our case is that it gives rise to uneconomicalbanking.  It raises the necessity of maintaining a relatively high interest income spreadOperating costs depend on labour productivity, technology, innovation andfrom the production process. In the economy-wide scale, these factors differentiate theweak from the strong banking system and provide internal strength and stability to thesystem.  Without gaining sufficient advantage in this respect, it is difficult to think of aA key issue relates to banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs).  Theamount of gross and net NPAs have been on the rise, although the rate of their growthdistribution of non-performing assets is skewed across banks.  Still a large number ofpublic sector banks have net non-performing assets ranging between 10 to 20 per centof net advances.  The Narasimham Committee has underlined the need to reduce theinternational presence.  I think this is an important requirement for our banking systemand is crucial to maintaining the viability of the system in future.  A two-prongedstrategy identified by the Committee viz., to reduce the backlog NPAs and improvingthe management efficiency and stricter enforcement of prudential norms, have to beitical aspect is the soundness of the banking system and how this isreflected in the practices and principles followed by banks.  Prudential norms andsupervision are necessary, but they are no substitute for the internal control system andsound business practices. The ability to distinguish between a normal business riskfrom an abnormal one, managing such risks and defining a prudent limit for risks are5essential functions for the bankers.  For long, Indian banking did not have a tradition ofAnother cracted upon to deal with this challenge.average level of net NPAs for all banks to 3 per cent by 2002 and to zero for banks withhas been below the overall rate of expansion of advances.

This annual conference is a testimony to the economiceconomists with long experience in banking and the financial sector.  The issue that Iwould like to pose before this conference is: are we making the best and most effectiveuse of economists working in the banking sector for improving the functioning ofbanks, and for that matter, improving the operational efficiency of the financial sectoras a whole?  In commercial organisations like banks, economics departments have theadvantage of not being excessively burdened with day-to-day problems of running thebanks or ensuring safety and profitability of individual transactions.  They are in aposition to take a strategic or longer term view of the comparative or competitivecosts/benefits of various kinds of services and products offered by them.  They alsohave the opportunity, to study from their vantage point and from a practical angle, theworking of the financial system and various improvements needed to strengthen theHowever, for bank economists to be able to perform these functions, it seemsneed for some “attitudinal” change on the part of economists themselves.  Those whowork in the commercial banking sector have to be prepared to accept operationalresponsibility, to work in the field, and to familiarise themselves fully with thecommercial aspects of their bank’s work.  Their work has to be operationally relevant,and it must contribute to the financial soundness of bank’s operations. This is possibleAt present, th e role of economists in our banking sector seems to be toonarrowly defined.  They are viewed as keepers of data, particularly macro-economicdata, and undertake periodic review or analysis of macro-economic trends in theeconomy.  They are seldom involved in undertaking any operational work or indeveloping strategic policy choices or even in treasury or foreign exchange functions.All over the world, with deregulation and globalisation of the financial sector, the roleof economists in the banking sector has been changing and becoming more and morefocussed on analysis and valuation of risk associated with various alternatives,particularly in emerging economies that are subject to greater volatility in the financial8sector.
