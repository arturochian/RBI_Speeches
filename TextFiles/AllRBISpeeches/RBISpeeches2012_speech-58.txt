Three basic dimensions of an inclusive financial system? Banking penetration? size of the banked population, i.e., number of adult population having abank account? number of bank accounts as a proportion of the total population? Availability of the banking services? number of bank outlets & ATMs (per 1000 population)? number of bank branches per 1000 adult population and also number ofbranches per square km? Usage of the banking system? merely having a bank account does not ensure that the system isinclusive; adequate utilization is imperative? volume of outstanding deposit and credit as proportion of the Net DistrictDomestic Product6State-wise Index of financial InclusionKerala, High Financial InclusionMaharashtra,KarnatakaThe all-India level fallsTamil Nadu, Punjab, in the medium FI Medium Financial Inclusion Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, categoryHimachal Pradesh, HaryanaWest Bengal, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Meghalaya, Tripura, Odisha, Rajasthan, Low Financial InclusionArunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur(Source: RBI Working Paper on Financial Inclusion in India : A case-study of West Bengal by Sadhan Kumar7Chattopadhyay)Need to focus on Policies, Partnership,Processes & Products relating to? SHGs? MFIs? Business Correspondents? Technologyfor meaningful financial inclusion8SHG Bank Linkage Programme? ‘Savings-first, credit later’ model? credit discipline ‘social collateral’ made SHGs bankable.? For banks dealing with groups of people meant? reducing in transaction costs,? reducing the credit risks through ‘peer pressure’ and? making people save? Challenges? inadequate outreach in many regions, delays in opening of SHG accountsand disbursement of loans, impounding of savings by banks as collateral9SHG-2? More focus on voluntary savings? Cash credit system of lending over 3 to 5 years cycle? to minimize the problem of inadequate finance and non-availability ofrepeat loans? Enabling creation of Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) within SHGs? to scale up economic activities by more entrepreneurial members? Improving risk mitigation systems by bringing in third party audit? Building second tier institutions? Strengthening the monitoring mechanism? Addressing training requirements10Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs)? Graduated from an “experiment” to a well-accepted paradigmof rural and developmental financing in India.? MFIs have served the underserved/un-served populace andimproved access to credit? debate on their style of corporate governance and ethics ofconducting business? To sustain existence, business and credibility, MFIs must? revisit their business model –profitability vs. profiteering? re-engineer the customer responsive processes? revisit business strategy? reinvent the sector as a community relevant to public and policy11supportBusiness Correspondents? Recommendations of the Internal Group to examine issues relating to ruralcredit and microfinance? Business Facilitators (BFs) and Business Correspondents (BCs) for ensuringdoor step delivery of financial products and services? Expansion of BC universe? Owned by corporates? Owned by banks? Ultra-small centres of banks? simple brick & mortar structure located between base branch and BClocations? terminal linked to CBS and a pass book printer? Interoperability of BCs? a customer can approach any BC? allow BCs of one bank to service customers of other banks12? transactions and authentications are carried out online on CBS platformIssues & challenges ? Viability of the model? need for more products and more innovations? Remuneration of BCs? Technology related issues? Banks exposed to multiple risks? credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk? Mis-selling of financial products to uninformed & illiterate consumers? Conflict of interest in case of corporate BCs? Difficulty in replacing the BCs? Cash management? people not willing to deposit huge amounts with the BCs13Possible solutions? Deeper engagement of banks? at the corporate and the local levels? Hand-holding by banks by way of orientation/training? Expanding the BC network? cluster approach (?)? Redesigning existing/introduction of innovative products? No Frill Accounts (NFA) replaced by Basic Bank Account? Micro-insurance products bundled with savings/credit products? Appropriate financial literacy initiatives? Awareness about customer grievance redressal mechanism14Tapping technology platform? Key to providing models for efficient delivery of small valuetransactions in large volumes? while reaping economies of scale.? Helps in spreading financial literacy? both as a delivery channel and as an intrinsic part of the learning process? Various platform to choose from? Smart cards, micro-ATMs, ATMs? Mobile technology15? Aadhar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS)Tapping technology platform? Experimentation with mobile based remittance services forreaching the unbanked population? M-Pesa (Kenya), Tigo Cash (Paraguay), Pago Movi (Peru), Nipper(Mexico), (Oi) Brazil? deployment of technology to service low income,financially excluded households? Common thread? most schemes use mobile phones? others use point-of-sale devices in conjunction with magnetic stripecards (mostly in Latin America),? some use both mobile phones and point-of-sale devices (WIZZIT in16South Africa and Smart in the Philippines).Mobile banking? Defined as undertaking banking transactions using mobile phones bybank customers that involve credit/debit to their accounts? Rapid growth in the number of mobile phone subscribers in India? banks in collaboration with telecom companies have developed an alternatechannel of delivery of banking services? Value and volume are increasing? growth rate is low when compared with the mobile subscriber base? banks are yet to fully exploit this technology? Tapping the potential for financial inclusion? bank-led mobile banking model for achieving financial inclusion17Mobile banking? Mobile Network Operator (MNO) based approach? Limitations and concerns (e.g. Safricom)? Banks & MNOs collaborative relationship is preferable? Reserve Bank has provided the policy framework? Plausible reasons for low levels of collaboration? ownership of the customer, control of transactions and developing anappropriate revenue sharing model? Expectations from banks and mobile operators? arrive at appropriate decisions while protecting their mutual interests? a “win win” situation for both and serve the larger public good of18financial inclusionInter-bank Mobile Payment Service(IMPS)? Instantaneous 24x7 electronic funds transfer system?

Pilot scheme in 4 districts of Jharkhand state? MGNREGA wages to labourers credited to their Adhaar enabledaccounts? beneficiaries withdraw the amounts through Micro ATMs whichauthenticate their Aadhaar number21Challenges in using technology? Major constraint has been the technology itself? Non-functional hand-held machines, smart cards, networkconnectivity and availability of power? Limited number of technology service providers to cover theunbanked villages of all banks? Limited service centres for servicing these devices has resultedin banking operations coming to a halt in many villages? Leading to an erosion of confidence on the ICT-based BCmodel22Challenges in using technology? Adequate attention to security features? preventing fraud through robust security measures but not losingsight at ease and efficiency in operations? ensuring proper balance between assurance and accessibility? Measures taken by Reserve Bank of India? Second Factor Authentication? exists for Card Not Present (CNP) transactions? in the offing for the Card Present (CP) transaction – chip & pin orAadhar? encryption of mobile based transactions for value above `5,000/-23Challenges in using technology? Infrastructural limitation? poor internet connectivity slows the pace of banking transactions? Technology challenges for smaller banks like RRBs/Co-opBanks? CBS linkages through sponsor banks? NABARD lending a helping hand? Financial Inclusion Technology Fund? Contribution of NPCI e.g. Ru Pay? Satellite Connectivity Scheme for the NE States? Reserve Bank offers subsidy to branches in the NE states offeringservices of electronic funds transfer free of charge to theircustomers24Challenges in using technology? Banks require partnership and collaboration with otherstakeholders? standardization and inter-operability? technology service providers, mobile network operators, corporatehouses and BCs? For significant investment in? technology applications? R&D efforts? monitoring and evaluation system? To develop delivery models? one private sector bank has approved a mobile service provider to act asits BC and provide services to the unbanked25Way forward? Banks & Technology Service Providers (TSPs) need to develop newproduct lines? rather than merely adopting complex products of urban India? Mobile POS, micro-ATMs, Pre-paid instruments, mobile enabled KCC,variable instalment RD, gold linked products, micro-pension, etc.? provide simple and basic banking services? requires easy-to-understand documentation process? Move from assisted to self-service model in a calibrated manner? More focus on innovative ideas to enhance the staying power of thepoor26Way forward? Policy objective of inclusive growth with financial stability cannot beachieved without ensuring universal financial inclusion? Requires collaboration between across governments, regulators,industry associations and other stakeholders? Coordinated national strategy is needed for success of the financialinclusion initiatives? Spreading awareness about? financial inclusion? tap innovative dissemination channels? training the grass-root level staff of banks/BCs/TSPs? financial technology? e-BAAT – Electronic Banking Awareness And Training27Way forwardFor evolving an effective financial inclusion delivery model?

Bankability of the poor holds a major business opportunity? develops a stable retail deposit base? curbs volatility with a diversified asset portfolio? expands the scope for sale of third party products (e.g. micro-insurance, pension, mutual funds, etc.)30Concluding thoughts? Financial inclusion has to be a subset of wider economic inclusion? important to generate revenue for economic inclusion for sustainableinclusion? financial inclusion would be possible if there is a felt need for financialservices? banks need to have both model and motivation to convert this tosustainable business opportunitiesFinancial inclusion is about viable and sustainable business models with focuson accessible and affordable products and processes, synergistic partnershipswith technology service providers for efficient handling of low value, largevolume transactionsandappropriateregulatoryandriskmanagementpoliciesthatensurefinancialinclusionandfinancialstabilitymoveintandem.31In all our efforts towards financial inclusion we should notforget …“Financial inclusion is not about giving handouts to anyone, it’saboutgettingthepeopletohelpthemselves”Barry WhitesideThank you
