Legislation on Fiscal Responsibility andReserve Bank’s Role : Some IssuesI am thankful to Mr. Mathur for giving me this opportunity to participate in thisworkshop.  Mr. Mathur’s letter of invitation stated that “In India there is an urgent need forimproved management of national finances”, and Reserve Bank of India has been advocatingfiscal prudence, especially since the reform process started about a decade ago.  The subjectis vast and complex, and in this speech, the issues relevant for a legislation on fiscalThe urgency for improving the management of public-finance, both at the Centre andwell- recognised and articulated.  However, there are two recent developmentsFirst, the Central Statistical Organisation has released a fortnight ago, QuickEstimates of National Income, Consumption Expenditure, Saving and Capital Formation for1998-99. There had been a fall in the rate of Gross Domestic Saving as a percentage of GDPat current market prices from 24.7 percent in 1997-98 to 22.3 percent in 1998-99. All thethree constituent sectors, viz., household, private corporate and public experienced lowersaving rates.  The fall in saving-rate is most marked in case of public sector to almost zerofrom 1.4 percent of GDP in 1997-98. The dis-saving of Government administration at Rs.71,939 crore rose so high, as to nullify the savings of both departmental and non-departmentalenterprises resulting in a negligible contribution of public sector of Rs.572 crore.  PrivateFinal Consumption Expenditure as a percentage of GDP, at current market prices fell from64.5 percent in 1997-98 to 63.6 percent while there has been a corresponding increase inGovernment Final Consumption Expenditure from 11.3 percent to 12.3 percent.Further, the fiscal situation, especially fiscal transparency is no longer a matter of domesticconcern alone.  India is important in the world-economy, and has been recognised as such inview of its membership in G-20.  Clearly, we not only influence but are also influenced byglobal economic developments.  We need to benchmark our codes and practices with bestinternational practices.  We are doing it through a Standing Committee constituted byGovernor Jalan, in which both the RBI and Ministry of Finance are represented.  Fiscalaspects are an extremely significant component of the transparency regime. Whether throughspecific legislation or otherwise, our fiscal processes have to meet global standards, while thequality of fiscal management would influence both our growth-prospects and standing in thePeep into the pastate to conclude from the above considerations alone that there isa sudden provocation or favour of sound fiscal management.Mr. Premchand, world-renowned expert on the subject mentions that in the late nineteenthcentury, a Royal Commission on Expenditure in India called Welby Commission explored*1reductions in Government expenditure.realisation in It will not be appropriworld-economy.that necessitate urgent actions.States has been Context and Urgencyresponsibility in India will be addressed with special reference to the role of RBI.Mr. Chairman and friends,There must be many reasons why the strategy has not succeeded, and here also, a reference tonineteenth century India may not be out of place : and I quote from a footnote of Mr.Premchand’s book on Government Budgeting and Expenditure Controls (page 276) “Writingabout the Indian Government’s efforts toward economy in expenditure, Sir Richard Templeobserved ”some who preach economy as a rule seem to think that a favourite project is to bethe exception; the sense of its particular merits causes the general maxims to be forgotten”(India in 1882 (London : Macmillan), p. 449). in pre-independent India, there was a piece by M. K. Gandhi in Young India, inthFinancial and Economic Supplement, Ahmedabad, Thursday 10 May 1923, which reads as“In every modern civilised community the outlay of public funds, collected by contributionsfrom the community in a variety of forms, calls forth the liveliest interest from the tax-payers,and demands the greatest carefulness from the authorities entrusted with the outlay.  Intheory, at least, the layout of these monies must be, like the sowing of the seed by the farmer,in the hope and with the intention that it would be returned a hundred-fold to the sower. Butthis supreme principle of public expenditure seems never to have been learnt by thePandey of Ministry of Finance, who has worked extensively onthe subject, the issue of fiscal management had come up for detailed discussion in theConstituent Assembly also while debating Articles 292 and 293, enabling ceilings onborrowings to be imposed by Parliament.  Among those who advocated more stringentprovisions was Mr. H.V. Kamath who said that “the purpose of the loan goes to the root ofthe matter”, and hoped that “not merely the financial limits but also the purpose of every loanThe issue appears to have been cl inched by the eloquence of Dr. B.R. when he said, “this article specifically says that the borrowing power of the executive shall besubject to such limitations as Parliament may by law prescribe. If Parliament does not make alaw it is certainly the fault of Parliament and I should have thought it very difficult to imagineany future Parliament, which will not pay sufficient or serious attention to this matter andenact a law.  We hope that Parliament will take this matter seriously and keep on enactinglaws so as to limit the borrowing authority of the Union.  I go further and say that I not onlyThe issue of fixing borrowing limits by the Parliament was no doubt, r aised time andagain, by Estimates Committee in 1957-58, and in some of the subsequent reports ofEstimates Committee and Public Accounts Committee. However, no Parliamentary orr, the present thinking on Fiscal Responsibility is slightly different from debt-ceiling and could go either beyond a mere ceiling on borrowings or could fall short of it byfocussing on transparency-issues.  There is a link between ceiling on debt and fiscalresponsibility, but they are not the same and in that sense, the present proposal is differentfrom the debates in past.2Howevelegislative action to fix a limit on borrowing has been taken so far.hope but I expect that Parliament will discharge its duties under this article”.Ambedkarwill come before Parliament for its approval”.As brought out by Mr. Government in India”.follows: EvenIt is useful to explain the role of RBI in the events leading up to the current proposalfor a legislation on Fiscal Responsibility (FR).  Firstly, RBI has been in the forefront ofsensitising the policy makers to the consequences of fiscal dominance.  Secondly, automaticmonetisation of budget deficit by RBI was discontinued. Thirdly, some caution, if not a limit,on RBI’s net support to Government’s borrowing programme has been accepted in thearrangements leading to Ways and Means for Government of India.  Fourthly, RBI hadalready highlighted the importance of a statutory ceiling on debt through a Technical Paperpublished in the RBI Bulletin of December 1997.  Fifthly, RBI has been trying to advocateprudence in extending sovereign guarantees, which has resulted in some States passing legalenactments and Government of India creating a guarantee fund.  Sixthly, State FinanceSecretaries are already working as a Committee assisted by RBI, on issues relating tointegrity of budget process and transparency in budget.  Seventhly, RBI conducted a seminara few months ago, in which senior officials of Centre and State participated, on matersMore recently, Finance Minister announced a decision to pilot a Bill on Fiscal Responsibility,and Government of India, therefore, desired that RBI which is not only the monetaryauthority but also a banker to Government, and a debt manager to Government should have aWorking Group to assist in the preparation of Fiscal Responsibility Bill. In the light of thedeliberations of the Working Group, a Government of India committee on FR has beenconstituted with Secretary (Economic Affairs) as Chairman and Deputy Governor, RBI asone of the members.  The working group of RBI is still expected to provide technical inputsto this process, with two experts, viz. Dr. Lahiri of Institute of Public Finance and Policy andDr. Mitra of National Institute of Law, being members in both the Working Group of the RBIand the Government Committee.The objectives of FR in a specific context could be several of the ma ny possibleobjectives such as : (a) inter-generational equity; (b) macro-stability; (c) fiscal  sustainabilityand  fiscal  solvency;  (d) elimination  of deficit bias; (e) fiscal  transparency,  (f) fiscalaccountability,   including  penal  actions, (g) autonomy of monetary policy, including limitsA legislation on FR may have to focus on a medium term framework in addition toannual budget, methods of promoting prudent fiscal behaviour, enhancing transparency in allThe issues for us are: how to meet these objectives without eroding supremacy ofParliament itself in matters relating to fiscal management; and with suitable flexibility neededto meet emerging situations.  The Parliamentary system and federal nature of our politywould add to the complexities in the design and implementation of a legislation, and some ofThe more important institutional issues would perhaps be: (a) whether there is a needto bring about FR through a new constitutional provision, or a mere law, and if it is the latter,3Institutional Issuesthese have been alluded to in the debates of Constituent Assembly.government policies having a bearing on fiscal management and finally, accountability.on access of Government to central bank credit.Objectivesrelating to fiscal rules and related international practices.Role of RBI in the Processwhether it should be linked to the existing constitutional provisions on ceilings on debt andguarantees; (b) whether the FR would be passed by Parliament to cover only the Centre orwhether it should be made applicable to all States in addition, by obtaining necessaryauthorisations, or whether it should leave the matter to the concerned States with or withoutsome persuasion or through a model law by Centre; (c) whether the law should be sodesigned as to avoid or limit judicial interpretation and jurisdiction; (d) .whether theconvention of secrecy of budgetary process is consistent with the most significant aspect ofFR, namely transparency.  It can be argued that, except where anticipatory actions arepossible, such as specific tax-measures, secrecy is not warranted and indeed secrecy ofbudget process stifles transparency of not only annual exercise, but also medium-term, andThere are universally recognised fiscal policy rules, and legislation incorporates oneor several specific targets or ceilings or conditionalities or even prohibitions.  There arebroadly three types of rules, balanced-budget or deficit rules; borrowing rules and debt orOf direct relevance to the RBI is a borrowing rule that prohibits or limits borrowingThe FR has to balance between a credible rule, quantitatively determined and need forflexibility in fiscal management.  Yet another aspect relates to the time frame within whichthese rules can be implemented.  It is possible to visualise milestones, on these rules,incorporated into the legislation or enabling provisions made in FR to fix milestones fromSignificant operational issues relate to accounting principle s and practices.  Thesewould include budget coverage, adoption of accrual system to some degree, projections ormedium term parameters, explanations for short-term deviations, valuation of assets atmarket value or foreign currency liabilities at current rate of exchange, etc.Illustratively, fiscal management issues in our country comprise: (a) the fact that asignificant part of liabilities are not covered by assets even as per current valuation methods,(b) significant part of current expenditures are “charged”; (c) there is inertial growth ofsalaries, pensions, Dearness Allowance etc.; (d) there are also vertical and horizontal issues.If FR is imposed rigidly on Centre there can be impact on States and differential impactamong States, (e) the overhang of the past makes corrections possible only over the mediumterm, and hence need for delineation of transition path from the current situation to full-The most important issue relates to defining a trigger for what constitutes non-compliance with fiscal responsibility, warranting corrective action, and if so what are the4Procedural Issuesfledged fiscal responsibility, perhaps lasting over several years.Fiscal Management IssuesAccounting Issuestime to time.by government from a central bank.reserve rules.Fiscal Policy Rulesperhaps intra-year measures.corrective actions.  At one extreme, there may just be reputational risk, while at the otherApart from defining trigger and options of automatic sequestration or revenuesurcharges, since the budget is annual, the tracking of intra-year situation becomes critical.This is particularly relevant in view of the acute intra-year mismatches observed betweenThe penalty for non-compliance should be built into the process, recognising that repudiationthrough revision of law itself is not impossible, since this was done by Parliament in severalcases.  Further, a view has to be taken on who should be the monitoring authority orauthorities, i.e., Comptroller and Auditor General, Parliamentary Committee or OversightCommittee of eminent experts.Whether and how budget documentation needs to be altered and intra-year reportingdocumentation introduced (say every quarter) to Parliament would also have to beconsidered.  In particular, a case is made out by some experts for periodical reporting directlyto public, with remarks of Oversight Committee of experts in addition to reporting andaccountability to Parliament.Another issue is whether Oversight Committee, without prejudice to ParliamentaryCommittee, should indulge in a pre-budget review or only post-budget review, and whether it There is, in cases of some countries, personal accountability, of say the Minister forthe estimates and adherence to it.  It has to be seen whether such accountability is feasible inFinally, there are a set of issues relating to RBI itself.   that the ultimate fiscalauthority is with Parliament and that cannot be constrained except by self imposition, shouldFR bar automatic monetisation by RBI or prescribe rules for it and should RBI be bannedfrom participating in primary issues of Government stock and finally should FR promoteProcedural Coordination with StatesInevitably, there would be need for a coordination in many areas of fiscalmanagement, between Centre and States.  This could conveniently extend to even proceduresLet us take an example. States have recently agreed to adopt uniform floor rates of taxin respect of sales tax.  This is only the first step towards having uniform rates of taxation.However, neither uniform floor rates nor uniform rates of tax would be meaningful unlessthere is a standard and universally accepted classification of goods.
