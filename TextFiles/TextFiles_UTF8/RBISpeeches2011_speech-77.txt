Central Bank Governance Issues  1 Some RBI Perspectives   Duvvuri Subbarao  ________________________________________________________    Thank you for this opportunity to speak on some central bank governance  issues from the perspective of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). I will raise some  specific issues. But before getting into them, I want to make two broad comments  about the mandate of the Reserve Bank and our systems of autonomy and  accountability. That will give you the broad context for appreciating the specific  issues that I will raise later.     RBIs Mandate  2. RBI has a mandate that is wider than is typical of central banks. The  2 preamble to the RBI Act, 1934 describes its main functions as "...to regulate the  issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary  stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the  country to its advantage." This preamble indicates the two core functions of the  Reserve Bank: (i) issue of currency; and (ii) monetary authority. The Act also  entrusts other functions to the Reserve Bank such as regulation of non-bank                                                    1  Comments by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the meeting of the  Central Bank Governance Group in Basel on May 9, 2011.  2  The legislation to establish a central bank for India was passed in 1934 and the Reserve Bank of  India came into being a year later in 1935. The Bank was set up on the basis of the  recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission. Earlier in 1913, John Maynard Keynes who  served as an officer of British Administration in India, had proposed a State Bank to be set up in  India, which was to engage in both central banking and commercial banking functions. Keynes  proposed that the Bank be run by a Central Board consisting of the Governor, the Deputy Governor,  a representative of Government and three or more non-voting assessors. financial institutions, management of foreign exchange reserves, management of  sovereign debt - by statute in respect of central government and by agreement in  respect of state governments - and regulation of forex, money and government  securities markets and their derivatives.    3. The legal mandate for our other key functions and responsibilities comes  from specific statutes:   The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 together with the RBI Act, gives us  the power to regulate and supervise commercial banks and cooperative  banks.     The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 empowers the RBI to  regulate the foreign exchange market.        The Payment & Settlement Systems Act, 2007 mandates RBI to regulate  and supervise the payment and settlement systems.    4. All the statutes put together make the Reserve Bank a full service central  bank. We are the issuer of currency and are the monetary authority. We regulate  and supervise banks, non-bank financial companies and segments of the financial  markets. We are the banker and debt manager to the Government. We are the gate  keepers of the external sector. We regulate and supervise the payment and  settlement system. Being both the monetary authority and banking sector regulator  gives us also the principal responsibility for financial stability.    5. Even as the Reserve Banks statutory mandate is wide compared to that of  other central banks, what really sets us apart is the key role the Reserve Bank has had in driving Indias development agenda. Several national level programmes  such as those for the flow of credit to the agriculture sector and for small and  medium industries were initially designed and implemented by the Reserve Bank.  The apex national institutions for agriculture credit (NABARD), industrial finance  (IDBI) are offshoots of what were once departments within the Reserve Bank. The  Reserve Bank has been at the forefront in nurturing institutions and developing  financial markets in India - the money market, the foreign exchange market and the  government securities market. Efforts in recent years have focussed on enhancing  the depth, integrity, transparency and efficiency of these markets.     6. The Reserve Bank pioneered the Lead Bank Scheme in 1969 whereby a  designated bank in each district coordinates the flow of credit from all institutions  in the district in support of the district credit plan. The Reserve Bank also issues  directions and monitors the priority sector lending scheme, whereby all commercial  banks are required to set apart a prescribed share of their total advances to priority  sector. In recent times, the Reserve Bank has been leading the effort towards  financial inclusion and financial literacy with the aim of eventually providing all  households in the country meaningful access to the formal financial sector.     Autonomy and Accountability  7. My second introductory comment is about autonomy and accountability.  Neither the RBI Act nor any rules lay down a formal accountability mechanism. In  the absence of a specific formulation, the fallback is on the general principle  underlying a democracy - which is to render accountability to the parliament through the Finance Minister. The Reserve Bank assists the Finance Minister in  answering parliament questions that pertain to its domain. Besides, the Standing  Committee on Finance of Parliament summons the Governor for testimony on  specific issues including legislations under consideration.     8. As regards autonomy, the Reserve Bank has not been accorded autonomy  under the statute. The RBI Act  lays down that the Central Government may give  directions to the Bank, from time to time, after consultation with the Governor,  where considered necessary in public interest.     9. To an untutored observer, the above arrangements present a picture of a  central bank with limited autonomy, and that too enjoyed at the pleasure of the  Government, juxtaposed with relatively loose systems of accountability.     10. The reality, however, is quite different. RBI in effect functions with a  functionally autonomous mandate and there has been no instance so far of the  Government exercising its reserve powers to issue a directive. This is all the more  remarkable since the  interaction between the Government and the Reserve Bank is  closer and more frequent than is typical in other countries, and this draws from the  key role of the Reserve Bank in financial sector reforms and economic  development. But this close relationship has not spilled over into the Government  encroaching on the Reserve Banks autonomy in making monetary policy and  regulatory policy.    11. The systems of accountability too are not loose contrary to what the formal  picture might suggest. Since we are not an inflation targeting central bank, there is  no formal memorandum of understanding (MOU) or a Results Agreement  between the Government and the Reserve Bank. Nevertheless, we render  accountability for our performance on inflation. We explain the rationale for our  monetary policy stance quite extensively. Importantly, the Governor addresses a  press conference following each policy review in order to disseminate the specifics  of the policy and the expected outcomes, and to respond to questions from the  media. This is followed by structured interviews in the print and electronic media.  Our latest initiative in the dissemination process is a post-policy teleconference  with researchers and analysts where the Governor and the Deputy Governors  respond to questions from them.     12. For most of the other important, non-monetary policy decisions, it has now  become standard practice for the Reserve Bank to consult with stakeholders and  call for feedback on the draft policy before a final decision is taken.     13. One of the determinants of rendering accountability is the quality of  accounting standards and of financial reporting and disclosure. The RBI complies  with best practices in accounting, and marks to market its holdings of domestic and  foreign currency assets. However, only realised gains are recognised as income.    Disclosures provided in the Annual Report of the RBI are fairly comprehensive and  provide disaggregated analysis in respect of all major balance sheet heads including  reserves and income and expenditure.    14. The sum and substance of this is that RBI renders accountability not as a  matter of compliance with a specific provision of law but as a matter of self- discipline required of a responsible public institution, and this self-discipline has  over time got enshrined into a code of conduct.    15. After these introductory comments on the mandate of the Reserve Bank,  and our systems of accountability, let me turn to some specific governance issues.    Formulation of Monetary Policy  16. Monetary policy decisions are made by the Governor. There is no formal  committee structure like the FOMC of the Fed or the Monetary Policy Committee  (MPC) of the Bank of England. The Governor holds structured consultations with  the four Deputy Governors and they constitute an informal MPC although a  committee structure is not enjoined under the law or the rules. By its very nature  there is no voting in this committee and the final call is that of the Governor.    17. We do have a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy  that acts as a proxy policy committee, but it is advisory in nature. It comprises the  Governor as chairman, the Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy as the  vice chairman and other three Deputy Governors as members. Besides, the  committee has five external members, two of whom are experts from the Central  Board of the Bank while the other three are drawn from a wider pool. The external  members are nominated by the Governor. They give specific recommendations on  policy options and these are minuted. We have recently started putting the minutes of the meeting in the public domain, including specific recommendations, without  directly identifying members with their advice.     18. Ahead of each quarterly monetary policy announcement, there is also an  extensive process of structured consultation by the Governor with banks, financial  market representatives, trade bodies and industry associations. We also convene a  meeting of economists and analysts twice a year, ahead of the annual policy in  April and the second quarter policy in October.     19. Finally, close to the policy decision, an established practice for the  Governor is to meet the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister informally, give  them an assessment of the macroeconomic situation and indicate to them his  proposed policy stance. This is only a matter of courtesy, and the process has not  impinged on the autonomy of the Reserve Bank in monetary policy making. The  consultation with the Finance Minister, in particular, should be seen as an avenue  for fiscal-monetary coordination, since on a reciprocal basis, the Finance Minister  too takes the Governor into confidence on the fiscal stance ahead of presenting the  budget to the Parliament.    20. An issue that comes up often is that even as the current system is working,  whether we might be better served by having a formal MPC with its majority  advice becoming binding. My own view is that we should be moving towards an  MPC system, but in a phased manner. There are some pre-conditions to be met.  First, the central bank should be given legally-backed formal autonomy. Second, in  a situation where inflation dynamics are more often dictated by supply side elements, the central banks ability to control inflation is restricted. An MPC  mechanism in such a situation can weaken the coordination between the  Government and the Reserve Bank. However, when our financial markets deepen  further, operating procedures improve and monetary transmission becomes more  efficient, shifting to an MPC system becomes a realistic option.     Inflation Targeting  21. Inflation targeting, by its very nature, is an issue in central bank  governance. The defining features of an inflation targeting central bank are a  precise mandate, a single instrument (the policy interest rate) in its armoury, a  single minded devotion to achieving this target and a principal-agent relationship  with the Government.     22. The Reserve Bank is not an inflation targeting central bank. Nevertheless  there is an influential view that our economy will be better served if the Reserve  Bank becomes one. The argument is that inflation hurts much more in a country  like India with hundreds of millions of poor people and that the Reserve Bank will  be more effective in combating inflation if it is not burdened with other objectives.     23. This argument is contestable. Inflation targeting is neither feasible nor  advisable in India, and for several reasons. First, in an emerging economy like ours,  it is not practical for the central bank to focus exclusively on inflation oblivious of  the larger development context. The Reserve Bank cannot escape from the difficult  challenge of weighing the growth-inflation trade off in determining its monetary  policy stance.    24. Second, the drivers of inflation in India often emanate from the supply side  which are normally beyond the pale of monetary policy. In particular, given the low  income levels, food items have a relatively larger weight in the consumption basket  in India compared to advanced economies and even many emerging market  economies. We have three consumer price indices each covering different segments  of the population with the weight for food ranging between 46-70 per cent.  Monetary Policy, as is well known, is an ineffective instrument for reining in  inflation emanating from supply pressures. It is unrealistic, under these  circumstances, to expect the Reserve Bank to deliver on an inflation target in the  short-term.     25. An alternative that is put forward is that we could target core inflation rather  than headline inflation. That is not a feasible solution either. An inflation index,  with half the basket excluded from it, hardly reflects reality. Moreover, the  exclusion of food from the core index can be justified if average food inflation is  the same as the average non-food inflation. If food inflation is higher, as is  typically the case in many low income countries including India, then we would be  underestimating inflationary pressures on a systemic basis. That would mislead  3 policy prescriptions .     26. Even if, for the sake of argument, we settle on inflation targeting, we have a  problem about which inflation index to target. The headline inflation index is the  wholesale price index (WPI), and that does not, by definition, reflect the consumer                                                    3  In our case, over the last six years average food inflation (8.7 per cent) has been more than double  of non-food inflation (4.0 per cent). price situation. However, getting a single representative inflation rate for a large  economy with 1.2 billion people, fragmented markets and diverse geography is a  formidable challenge. The recent introduction of CPI-Urban and CPI-Rural is  welcome, but it still does not solve the problem of heterogeneity.    27. Finally, a necessary condition for inflation targeting to work is efficient  monetary transmission. In India, monetary transmission has been improving but is  still a fair bit away from best practice. There are several factors inhibiting the  transmission process such as an asymmetric relationship between depositors and  banks, administered interest rates on postal savings that are not adjusted in line  with prevailing interest rate trends and rigidities in the financial markets. All these  factors dampen the efficacy of monetary signals and complicate the adoption of an  inflation targeting regime in India.     28. Importantly, there is a political economy argument too against the Reserve  Bank becoming an inflation targetter. The intellectual basis for central bank  independence draws from Rogoffs conservative central bank construct. The  construct is based on the assumption that governments tend to favour growth and  employment while central banks, left to themselves, would seek to lower inflation.  Precise inflation targeting formalizes this arrangement and dilutes the scope for  interference in each others domain. Such independent policy pursuits by the  Government and the central bank, it is contended, serve the best interests of the  national economy.    29. This assumption does not hold in the case of India because societal  tolerance in India for inflation is low. Given the compulsions of democracy and the  large population of poor, any government in India has always to be, and indeed has  been, sensitive to price stability even if it means sacrificing output in the short- term. So, the argument of divergence of natural preferences as between the  government and the central bank that underpins the inflation targeting framework  does not hold in the case of India. Indeed both the Government and the Reserve  Bank have to factor in the short-term growth-inflation trade off in their policy  calculations.     Macroprudential Regulation and Supervision  30. One of the important lessons of the crisis is that a collection of healthy  financial institutions does not necessary make for a healthy financial system, and  consequently that microprudential regulation and supervision at the individual  institution level have to be complemented by macroprudential regulation at the  systemic level to guard financial stability.  There are several debates that have  surfaced centred around this issue including, what should be the ambit of  macroprudential policies, what are the instruments to be used, should  macroprudential concerns be part of the monetary policy calculus, which institution  or institutions should be given the responsibilities for macroprudential supervision  and what should be the arrangements for coordination.  All the above questions  raise several governance issues with political economy dimensions.    31. Consider the context. As part of the post-crisis reforms of regulatory  architecture, there is an increasing trend of entrusting macroprudential supervision  to central banks as an additional responsibility. Where central banks already have  this responsibility, it is being more explicitly defined.     32. All policy decisions, as much as they are based on analytical constructs,  eventually involve making judgements. But judgement plays a bigger role in  formulating macroprudential policies. This is so because formalizing the analytical  framework for macroprudential policies, demanding as it does defining the metrics  for identifying systemic risk and identifying the appropriate instruments, is  conceptually more challenging than is the case for other policies.      33. Possibly because of this judgement dimension, among central banks that are  new to macroprudential regulation and supervision, there is an apprehension that  performing this task will make them vulnerable to political interference. There is  also an unstated fear that once a culture of political interference into central bank  business gets a foothold, it will rapidly spillover into all areas of central bank  business, including monetary policy, and thus erode the much prized autonomy of  the central bank.     34. The Indian experience does not bear out this apprehension. Macroprudential  regulation and supervision have historically been a part of the Reserve Banks  mandate. Yet there have been no instances of political influence on the macro  prudential policies of the Reserve Bank acting in its capacity as the regulator. In  fact, the Reserve Bank enjoys as much autonomy over its regulatory decisions as it does on its monetary policy decisions, and the political system has not tried to  influence the Reserve Banks stance.     35. Indeed, in spite of India being a vigorous democracy with very little that  remains outside the political domain, the political system has respected the Reserve  Banks autonomy over its domain. This is a testimony of the credibility and  reputation that the Reserve Bank has earned for its professional integrity. The  political system has an incentive in keeping it that way.     Debt Management Office  36. The RBI Act mandates the Reserve Bank to be the debt manager of the  Central Government. The Reserve Bank also manages the debt of state  governments by mutual agreement as provided in law.  There is now a proposal to  shift this function out of the central bank, and this has generated a debate around  several governance issues.    37. To set the context for this debate, it should be noted that the Reserve Bank  has an impressive track record in debt management.  Even as the Governments  borrowing had gone up both in absolute and proportional terms, it has managed to  complete the borrowing programme in a cost efficient manner. With the average  maturity of government debt at around 10 years, India has one of the longest  maturity profiles in the world, which proved to be a source of major strength and  comfort during the crisis.     38. It could be argued that public debt management in India has been effective  because the Reserve Bank, which is the monetary authority, is also entrusted this  task.  Nevertheless, the progress on fiscal consolidation by the Government in the  years before the crisis suggested that there could be operational efficiencies to be  gained by shifting debt management to a separate Debt Management Office  (DMO).  The Government has accordingly set up a middle office of the DMO and  is proposing to move forward with a Public Debt Management Agency of India  Bill.      39. There is need to reconsider the content and pace of this process in view of  the revised circumstances post-crisis. The case for shifting debt management  function out of the central bank is made on several arguments such as resolving  conflict of interest, reducing the cost of debt, facilitating debt consolidation and  increasing transparency. These advantages are overstated.      40. The most potent of these arguments is the one relating to conflict of interest.  The other arguments pertain to mechanics of debt management which can be said  to be model neutral. Let me, therefore focus on the conflict of interest issue.     41. The primary conflict which is generally associated with a central bank  managing sovereign debt pertains to the one between its inherent responsibility as  the monetary authority, and its obligations as a debt manager. In particular, it is  argued that the central bank will be biased towards a low interest regime in order to  reduce the costs of sovereign debt even if it compromises its anti-inflation stance.  A similar conflict may also distort the open market operations of the central bank.    42. The above arguments, though valid in some countries, fail to recognize that  in countries such as India, given the large size of the government borrowing  program, sovereign debt management is much more than merely an exercise in  resource raising. The size and dynamics of government borrowing program has a  much wider influence on interest rate movements, systemic liquidity and even  credit growth through the crowding out of private sector credit demand.   Management of public debt, therefore, has necessarily to be seen as part of broader  macroeconomic management framework involving various tradeoffs. Once this is  recognised, the centrality of central banks in this regard becomes quite evident.  Only central banks have the requisite market pulse and instruments to aid in  making contextual judgements which an independent debt agency, driven by  narrow objectives, will not be able to do.      43. Also, it is not that these conflicts would disappear merely by shifting debt  management out of the central bank. In fact resolving those conflicts could become  much more complicated leading to inferior outcomes. This is because even after the  separation, the central bank would continue to be expected to manage the market  volatility and market expectations arising out of government borrowing.     44. Admittedly, a few years back, the challenges of managing the above  conflicts in the then prevailing context seemed to weigh in favour of separation of  debt management from the central bank. The constraining factor, even then, was  the high fiscal deficit. The fiscal position, which was improving in the years before  the crisis, got off-track during the crisis. The Government is making attempts to get back on to a path of fiscal consolidation post-crisis. The difference as far as the  Reserve Bank is concerned is that the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget  Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 in place which prohibits the Reserve Banks  participation in the primary auction for Government securities. A separate  mechanism for conveying monetary stance in the form of repo and reverse repo  rates under the Banks Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) has been put in place  in 2000. Furthermore, in a situation of excess capital flows requiring forex  intervention from the Reserve Bank and the consequent sterilisation through  issuance of Government bonds by the RBI, the coordination of debt management  with monetary operations needs to continue. This makes the case for separation  much weaker in the revised circumstances.     45. In the Indian context, there is the added complexity of managing the debt of  the states. The sensitivity of the states to entrust debt management to an agency of  the Central Government also needs to be kept in view given the political-economy  dimensions of our federal structure. This is all the more important since market  borrowings have emerged as the dominant source of deficit financing at the sub- national level. Taken together, the borrowing by states has attained a critical mass  vis-a-vis the absorptive capacity of the market. That makes it imperative to  harmonise the market borrowing programmes of the Centre and the States.  Separation of the Centres debt management from the central bank will make such  harmonisation difficult.   46. Thus, on balance, as long as there are institutionalized mechanisms to  negotiate various tradeoffs in a given context within the overarching objective of  achieving monetary and financial stability, separation of debt management from  central bank seems to be a sub-optimal choice. Even internationally, the emerging  post-crisis wisdom recognizes the interdependence between the functions of  monetary policy, financial stability and sovereign debt management and the need  for close association of the central bank with sovereign debt management.        Responsibility for Financial Stability  47. The Reserve Banks mandate for ensuring financial stability arises mainly  from its mandated functions of regulator of the banking system, regulator and  supervisor of the payment and settlement systems, regulator of the money, forex,  government security and credit markets, banker to the banks, as also the lender-of- the last resort. This unique combination of responsibilities for macroprudential  regulation and microprudential supervision, together with an implicit mandate for  systemic oversight has allowed the Reserve Bank to exploit the synergies across  various dimensions. The micro-level information coming from supervision of  individual institutions has been a valuable input for shaping the macro perspective.  On the other hand, the broad understanding from macroprudential regulation has  been effective in instituting prudential safeguards at the micro institution level.     48. Financial stability is explicitly entering the objective function of central  banks post-crisis. In the Reserve Bank though, we had all along pursued financial  stability as an important objective. Indeed, one of the main reasons the impact of the crisis on India has been blunted is because the Reserve Bank tightened the  provisioning norms and risk weights for sub-sectors that experienced rapid credit  growth in the years before the crisis such as real estate and consumer credit.   49. In India, there are other market regulators besides the Reserve Bank such as  the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Insurance Regulatory and  Development Authority (IRDA) and the Pension Funds Regulatory and  Developmental Authority (PFRDA) who contribute to the building block for  financial stability. Nevertheless the Reserve Bank has played an apex role by  tradition and by the fact that it regulates banks in a financial system that is bank- dominated. The channels of interconnection between banks and other financial  sector entities are within the regulatory perimeter of the Reserve Bank.      50. Though the Indian financial system weathered the global financial crisis  relatively unscathed, there was enhanced focus on the regulation of financial  system in India too in the wake of the global financial crisis. While the post-crisis  debate in most countries was on the reform of the regulatory architecture, and what  responsibilities to entrust to the central bank, the focus in India was on coordination  amongst regulators.  With a view to establishing a body to institutionalise and  strengthen the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, financial sector  development and inter-regulatory coordination, in December 2010, the Government  constituted the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) to be chaired  by the Finance Minister. The FSDC is to be assisted by a Sub-Committee to be  chaired by the Governor, RBI. This Sub-Committee has replaced the erstwhile  High Level Coordination Committee on Financial Markets (HLCCFM) under the chairmanship of Governor, RBI. While constituting the FSDC, the Government  held out a clear assurance that the setting up of the FSDC will not in any way erode  the autonomy of the regulators.      51. In terms of governance structure, the two-tier framework of FSDC and the  Sub-Committee presents an interesting case. The crisis has clearly demonstrated the  need for explicit delineation of responsibilities for financial stability across  agencies and the protocol for coordination among such agencies. The crisis has at  the same time brought forth the critical stake of the sovereign in ensuring financial  stability - the spillover costs in a crisis have to be borne by the governments. In the  Indian context, the proposed FSDC structure attempts to strike a balance between  the sovereigns objective of ensuring financial stability to reduce the probability of  a crisis and the operative arrangements involving the central bank and the  regulators. While the Sub-Committee under the Governor, RBI is expected to  evolve as a more active, hands-on body for managing financial stability in normal  times, the FSDC would have a broad oversight and will assume central role in crisis  times.     52. Since the Reserve Bank has historically been a macroprudential regulator,  not all the governance issues surrounding financial stability that have emerged  post-crisis are new to us.  Nevertheless, there are always unknown unknowns and  the system should be able to respond to them.  Now that the regulatory architecture  of the FSDC is in place, it is important for the Government and the regulators in India to develop conventions and practices which will serve the goal of preserving  financial stability without eroding the autonomy of the regulators.
