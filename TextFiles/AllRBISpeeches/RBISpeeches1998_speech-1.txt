I found them wellresearched, thought provoking, analytical, and wide ranging with operational relevance. I alsoread the keynote speeches and heard rapporteur’s reports. It is clear that the speeches anddeliberations were of a very high standard, giving a fine balance between the present and future,In this address, I will share with you my rand om thoughts on the subject of bankingsoundness.  I will start with a general account of financial sector reform, i.e., pace, sequence,components and impact to show how different approaches are possible and also to show thatthere is no settled position. I will, thereafter, briefly recall major features of Indian experience onfinancial sector reform.  Then, we will explore what is new about banking soundness that we hadto have deliberations such as these.   We can then go on to appreciate the link betweenmacroeconomic management and banking soundness, and the feedback effects. Morespecifically, the relationship between monetary policy and banking soundness should beappreciated. I will conclude with some remarks on what could be important areas ofThe term financial sector reform is used interchangeably with the terms financialliberalisation and financial deregulation.  Financial liberalisation is a process ofremoval/reduction of financial market distortions, mainly created by Government or central bankinterventions. There is a debate with regard to financial sector liberalisation as to what should bethe appropriate pace, sequencing, components, etc. It is necessary to recognise that there is nosettled wisdom on many of these aspects.

Experience has shown that countries that liberalised rapidly are more proneto reversals – examples are Chile, Argentina, Turkey.  However, countries that have phased outcontrols gradually, such as South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines have also facedThe sequencing of reform can be analysed with regard to the linkage with generalmacroeconomic situation, ownership, regulatory and supervisory framework, and external sectorFinancial sector liberalisation could be initiated during a period of macroeconomicArgentina and Chile decontrolled interest rates during a per iod of high inflation butundertook a large number of measures during a period of macroeconomic stability.

To broadly generalise, first, there is evidence that efficiency in theallocation of credit improved after liberalisation.  Despite weaker economic conditions, privateinvestment has grown or financial constraints have eased.  Second, financial deepening hasincreased.  Third, evidence regarding the impact of liberalisation on saving and/or consumptionis mixed.  Experience has shown that while liberalisation permitted a consumption boom andreduced saving in many countries, saving did increase in some other countries.  Fourth, theimmediate impact on interest rates was disparate, with rates sometimes rising and in somecountries falling.  Fifth, after liberalisation, financial crises have taken place with some countriesexperiencing more than one crisis.  Sixth, financial liberalisation has generally resulted in moreI will conclude this section by drawing some broad conclusions from experience withfinancial sector First, financial sector reforms appear to have better chances of success in an environmentof macroeconomic stability.

However, the costs of financial-repression were recognised in seventiesand a wave of deregulation and marketisation occurred. Soon, it was realised that both ontheoretical and empirical grounds, financial sector in general and banking sector in particularneed to be carefully regulated – though who should regulate, how it should be regulated, withwhat objectives and instruments are still being debated. There are, without doubt, valid reasonsFirst, the soundness issue is not merely a developing country issue.

It is not inconceivable that private sector banks get intotrouble. If such failures have systemic implications, governments all over the world may bailthem out.  Even if the central bank takes the burden as a lender of last resort, in effect it is at theexpense of transfer of resources to government.  In regard to public sector banks, governmenthas a more direct fiscal stake. Thus, in the interest of soundness, where restructuring eitherthrough recapitalisation or a possible less costly, Asset Reconstruction Company route isattempted, the ultimate cost if any, has to be borne by government.  In brief, whether banks are inthe public or private sector, government has a stake in ensuring bank soundness. Ensuringsoundness of banks is in the long-term interest of fiscal management just as prudent fiscalmanagement is in the long-term interest of bank soundness.
