Sambamurthy) to– study the challenges faced by the banks in providing mobilebanking to customers– examine the options/alternatives including the feasibility of usingencrypted SMS-based funds transfer• Two technical groups have also been constituted to– set standards for on-boarding mobile banking customers– set standards for industry agreements between banks and MNOsfor handling customer grievances• The National Unified USSD Platform (NUUP) of the NPCI offers aninteroperable USSD-based mobile banking service– this holds great opportunity for expanding the mobile banking11outreach in the countryBharat Bill Payment System (BBPS)• The BBPS is proposed to be a pan-India system for running the billspayment system in the country– the entire system operating on a single brand image so as to enjoin theconfidence and trust of the customers.• The BBPS is aimed to provide– convenience of ‘anytime anywhere’ bill payment– an interoperable bill payments for millions of customers in the country– replace the segmented bill payments taking place in silos at present• The proposed system will function as a tiered structure with a singlebrand image under the standards (technical and operational) set bythe centralized unit.– standards will also address the need for uniformity in handling customergrievances, settlement procedures and timelines, etc.• The operating units will link up the billers and the collection agentsand provide the interoperability which is lacking today12Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS)• The TReDS aims at addressing concerns related to efficient financingoptions for the MSME segment– eligible invoices and bills of MSMEs will be placed on the systemfor acceptance by the buyers– financed by financiers so as to ensure financing• The TReDS will – centrally on-board the various stakeholders – buyers, sellers and financiers– handle KYC and documentation related matters– ensure that master agreements are in place– standardize turnaround time for various activities involved in stages from uploading of invoices / bills to final payments on due dates13Role of banks in BBPS & TReDS• Many banks are providing bill payment services and paymentgateway services especially in card payments– network effect and positive impact with these banks joining the BBPS• Other banks will be able to leverage on the inter-operable platformof BBPS and offer enhanced services and bill payment options totheir clientele• Banks can also use their vast BC and agent network for this task• Banks have to work for the success of the TReDS through activeinvolvement and engagement• Banks would be expected to support setting up of desirablestandards for all operational processes and procedure so as to derivesynergy for all participants.The impact of this system for the hygiene in the eco-system will bepositive in the medium and long term for the MSME sector which is akey thrust area of banks’ business.14Security vs Convenience• Recent reiteration of an existing policy related to security and riskmitigation in card transactions has led to some debates– that Reserve Bank has stifled innovation!• Policy measures of RBI are proactive with focus on safety concerns• mandating online alerts for card transactions– now drawing attention of policy makers of other countries• mandating PIN entry for every transaction at ATM• mandating the need for additional factor of authentication forcard transactions– put in place in 2009• strengthening the security of internet banking transactionsincluding beneficiary management, velocity checks, etc.• migration from magstrip to CHIP and PIN cards• strengthening the security of card processing infrastructure• reducing the turnaround time for handling customer grievances15Security vs Convenience .. 2Changing consumer behavior being a challenge, the trade-off betweensecurity and convenience often is not an easy one, given the tenuoustrust placed on electronic payments in this country• Reserve Bank is in favour of innovation and innovative payments butit balances the convenience factor with suitable safeguards forprotecting or limiting customer liability– Focus is on Availability, Affordability & Acceptability yet with anAssurance about Safety & Security16Jan Dhan Yojana: Challenges & Opportunities • Opportunities for expanding business by

of profit versus growth• Harnessing ICT for sustainable financial inclusion• To protect the market share and profitability– Banks need to reposition themselves as niche players based on

services organization – forbanking, banks may not be needed(ala Bank 3.0: Why Banking is no longer somewhere you go, but something you do by Brett King)• Rise of powerful social media platforms– Banks should leverage on the increasing popularity of interactive socialplatforms for effective engagement with their customers18Concluding thoughts : New Possibilities• Leveraging social and mobile capabilities as well as cloud computingand software-as-a-service (SAS) would be the key for traditionalbanks to drive more customer interactions at a lower unit cost• Need for technology-enabled transformation to improve revenuegeneration, operational efficiency and risk management• With lower cost-to-serve capabilities coupled with technology-driventransformation of operating and distribution models, banks can nowreach new customers in new markets• Mining of Big Data can open up new revenue verticals for the banksand help better risk measurement alongwith effective identificationof sales or cost-saving opportunities.• By tapping social networks, banks can access customers’ socialprofiles, and thereby deepen their insights into individual customerbehavior19Concluding thoughts: Partners in Digital India Plan • India is in the cusp of a digital revolution – it may be ambitious butdefinitely achievable• Digital India Plan of the new
