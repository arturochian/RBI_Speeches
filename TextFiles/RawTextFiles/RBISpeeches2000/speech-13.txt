It is currently well recognised that although global capital flows have a potential for
improving efficiency and growth prospects, they also can trigger instability, due to a variety
of reasons. The objective of current deliberations on the international financial architecture is
to enhance efficiency of such flows while avoiding, to the extent possible, instability, and
managing instability if and when it occurs. These issues are assessed essentially from the
view point of developing countries, which, as a group has tended to be more vulnerable to
Though there are some differences of opinion as to whether liberalisation of capital account
would necessarily add to growth prospects of developing countries, there are several
developments in regard to international trade in goods and services, international business,
technology, cross border flows of capital, etc. that would necessitate a more active
management of capital account, with a view to continuously assessing the costs and benefits
In the current debate on international financial architecture, there is no settled position on
several of the actions being considered. In respect of liberalisation of capital account,
however, there appears to be a broad consensus viz.: such a liberalisation is desirable, should
be gradual, well-sequenced and undertaken in conjunction with several other measures at
micro and macro level. In most cases, the desirability of limiting total external debt,
especially short-term is generally advocated.
In other words, there is need for developing countries to choose or prioritise alternative forms
of capital flow on the basis of costs and benefits. In choosing the alternative forms, the costs

universally acknowledged in the current debate. The treatment of individual components of
the capital account and the pace of liberalisation need to vary. Briefly restated, the

It is also clear that while several initiatives are proposed at the global level, the task of
preventing a crisis is essentially a national responsibility though an enabling international
environment is sought to be put in place to facilitate action by individual countries. No doubt,
in today’s globalised world, prevention of crises as well as mitigating the effects require
multilateral efforts, but the social consequences of such crisis are to be met by the national
governments concerned. In this sense, the ultimate responsibility in regard to crisis
The policy makers in developing countries, therefore, have to manage their capital accounts
to ensure an orderly process of liberalisation. In this context, management of the capital
account involves management of control, regulation and liberalisation. Gradualism in
liberalisation implies that the mix between controlled, regulated and liberalised capital
transactions keeps changing gradually in favour of the latter. In fact, if the option of re-
imposing controls to meet an emergency is contemplated, the management of capital account
In India, capital account liberalisation is treated as a process. The medium term objective is
orderly liberalisation, while the short-run challenges are met by flexible use of the control
and regulatory framework In other words, there may be occasions when the pace of
liberalisation needs to be temporarily slowed down, or halted though in some rare cases, the
process has to be reversed albeit for a short period.
Context
Industrial and developing countries do have a common interest in encouraging larger but less
volatile global flows. Since the policy-making in developing countries involves gradual
liberalisation, the pace and sequencing would also depend on the international context as

Third, the potential benefits of liberalisation. For example, in some low-income developing
countries, the capital flow may be restricted to official flows , Foreign Direct Investment and
trade related flows. The immediate benefits of liberalisation in terms of private flows are,
therefore, not evident.
Fourth, the level of development of financial markets and consequently the possible
responses of domestic financial institutions to the liberalisation may be such as to indicate

In India, there is a significant opinion in favour of cautious liberalisation, but at the same
time, there are understandable fears of destabilisation. In India, there is, perhaps a greater
weight attached to stability. This may be in view of the size and structure of the economy and
the uncertain comfort level on international official, and private sector response to a crises on
an apolitical basis. Thus, the policy in India is to approach liberalisation on capital account
cautiously, gradually, in a well sequenced manner, treating it as a process and responding to
domestic monetary and financial sector developments as also the evolving international
financial architecture.
The mainstream thinking till the Asian crises was averse to capital-controls, but in the recent
past, such aversion has yielded to a lively debate on the efficacy of such controls, and
consequently the framework and operation of such controls. The control-framework can be
viewed from different angles , Basically, the control instruments are quantitative or price-
based, including price ceilings or floors and possibly a combination of the two. Controls or
lack of controls may be based on size of a transaction, purpose, or category of participant.
Asymmetrical treatments in regard to applicability and nature of controls are common
between inflows and outflows; between outflows associated with inflows (i.e. principal,
interest, dividend, profits and sale proceeds) and other outflows; resident and non-residents;
and between individuals, corporates, banks and other financial intermediaries. The
instruments of control do vary from non- applicability, to total prohibition with intermediate
regimes, say of approval on an automatic basis, case-by-case or simply price-based. The
In managing the capital account through control framework, there could be a prioritisation of
capital flows - in terms of their desirability or otherwise. Thus, for example, a higher
preference could be to Foreign Direct investment and long term debt compared to portfolio
flows and short term debt.

relatively more or less efficiency gains, compared to the costs of instability.
; efficiency vis-à-vis stability
;It must be recognised that the efficacy of control depends, among many other things, on the
category of flows or participant. For example, it is less complex to control the inflows from
non-residents, since non-residents are keen to have a legal title to their asset. Empirical
evidence indicates that the control over outflows from residents is facilitated more by
It is necessary to make a distinction between control framework and regulatory framework.
An important component of regulatory framework relates to prudential regulation on banks
vis-à-vis external sector. They may include provisioning requirements for net external
positions; limits on open positions, and limits on investments in foreign currency
denominated assets. There could also be differentiated tax regimes affecting the maturity
pattern. Monetary measures such as reserve requirements have both an external sector and
monetary angle. These regulatory instruments are part of package available for influencing
the size and composition of capital flows. Similarly, regulatory restrictions on portfolio
investments by securities regulator would also provide for different degrees of openness from
While controls may have a potential to be inefficient, there is considerable merit in using the
regulatory mechanisms for moderating the ebb and flow in capital movements. The gradual
movement towards liberalisation can be operationalised through a change in the mix and
rigour of controls or regulatory framework, especially taking into account the tendency
In regard to the dynamic of control or regulation vis-à-vis liberalisation, it is clear that a
workable framework appropriate to each country is necessary. The more important aspect of
management of capital account is the flexibility available in the framework to progressively
liberalise the capital-account transactions, depending on the domestic and international
a flexibility could permit quick responses to changes in
magnitudes, direction and composition of flows that may appear to be inappropriate to the
circumstances. This flexibility in operations may, for success, warrant complementarity with
other policies. Finally, there may be a case for retaining the freedom to re-impose controls or
tighten regulations as long as the vulnerability to highly speculative or motivated attack on
the currency exists, since market corrections may be more destabilising to the economy.
Thus, it may be wise, even in the liberalised framework in capital account to retain an option
In India, regulatory framework has been used in several combinations to address problems of
excessive inflows and pressures towards outflows, during the reform-period, implying short
term movements bi-directionally i.e. tightening or loosening controls as also regulations,
while maintaining medium-term progress in liberalisation. Controls, however, continue to
apply mostly to residents.
A qualitative change however, has been brought about in the legal framework for
management of foreign exchange in June 2000 by which the objectives of regulation are
redefined as facilitating trade and payments as well as orderly development and maintenance
of foreign exchange market in India. The legal framework envisages both developmental
dimension and orderliness or stability. The legislation provides power to the government to
reimpose controls if public interest warrants it.

appropriate tax regime and acceptable exchange rates, than through the control framework.It appears that the porous nature of capital controls is minimised if the dangers of capital
flows occurring in the guise of current account transactions are avoided. Among the measures
adopted in India are the twin requirements viz.; repatriation and surrender of current receipts
of the residents (which includes entities) and restricting foreign currency payments only to
genuine transactions, and in reasonable amounts. Furthermore, serious distortions in trade
policy could make the management of capital account difficult. Thus, liberalisation of import
of gold to officialising inevitable import of gold to satisfy the domestic demand was
considered essential to enable liberalisation of capital account in India. Moreover, if there is a
commodity-concentration in exports or imports (oil in the case of India), careful monitoring
is required to assess the impact and respond, if need be, with changes in management of
capital account.
Experience indicates that foreign currency denominated assets within the country and trading
of domestic currency outside the country could have destabilising effects on the balance
The adequacy of forex reserves is yet another important consideration in the management of
capital account. First, adequacy has to be viewed not only in terms of trade needs but also
other short term liabilities. Secondly, it is not merely the long term or short term debt in terms
 maturity that is relevant for reserves, but the  maturity. Thus, in managing
the capital account, the maturity profile of debt, including short term debt becomes important.
Thirdly, a trade-related debt which is in the nature of  debt may be less severe
on reserve-requirements. Fourthly, any addition to portfolio-flows may warrant comfort
through some additions to reserves, which implies that the net contribution to investment in
the country through portfolio flows is, in effect, less than what the magnitudes indicate. This
is not to deny the indirect effects on competition of enhancing efficiency through portfolio
flows. Fifthly, there is usually a cost of maintaining forex reserves and the net cost would
depend on the difference between the marginal cost at which the reserves have been built and
the marginal return from deployment of reserves. The liquidity management including level
of forward liabilities are also relevant. Disclosures of such liabilities, as in India, have proven
to be effective. Finally, while the optimal level of reserves is difficult to quantify, attention to
level of reserves and their management are critical to overall capital account management,
especially to the sentiments prevailing in forex markets. Often, the incremental changes in
level of reserves rather than the level seem to be of significance to market perceptions.
Further, the market perceptions appear to be more sensitive to downward movement in
reserves than upward movements. To the extent, management of capital account tries to
influence the size and composition of capital flows impacting on meeting of current account
deficit as well as movements in reserves , the adequacy of level of reserves is a relevant
factor.
In India, the level of forex reserves is so maintained and increased from year to year as to
cover adequately not only imports but also the short term liabilities, especially short term
debt and portfolio investment. Further, the level of reserves also takes into account the
operational need to enable the Reserve Bank to even out the mismatches between supply and
demand in forex markets and thus ensure orderly conditions in a less developed market

LinkagesOn exchange rate, the possibility of persistent misalignments due to reasons other than
domestic factors cannot be ruled out and correction cannot be left entirely to the market. The
developing countries do need some armoury to address such issues. It appears almost certain
that capital controls would be ineffective if in the popular perception, the exchange rate does
not appear to be realistic. In other words, there is considerable merit in the argument that
capital controls are not substitutes for an appropriate exchange rate regime even though
capital controls facilitate avoidance of excess volatility in the exchange rate that may be
appropriate. The activities in forex markets and its linkages with other markets, especially
money-market, debt market especially government securities market, and equity markets
have to be identified and monitored while managing capital flows. Recognition of linkages,
monitoring the developments, and willingness to intervene credibly in any or all of these
markets, as appropriate may be essential. Perhaps, markets should be aware of the broad
objectives of such intervention. As each of the financial market develops and gets integrated
with others, measures to increasingly liberalised capital account could be considered. Indeed,
it is possible to argue that liberalisation of capital account would aid the process of
development of financial markets, but this is valid only when some informed judgements are
made in respect of each country on the interactions between the management of capital
account and the financial markets. In any case, capital control or regulatory framework or
liberalisation would be ineffective or unstable in the absence of proper appreciation of such
Above all, irrespective of the extent of liberalisation, official monitoring and surveillance of
large international transactions and players would be helpful in effective and credible
management of capital account.
In India, during periods of surges in capital inflows, or pressures on outflows, operations in
the external sector were coordinated with actions by Reserve Bank in money and government
There are several policy areas that have been identified as being critical to the health of
global monetary and financial systems in future. Many of them fall within the jurisdiction of
the countries concerned. There is certainly an implicit recognition that the net benefits from
liberalisation of capital account in respect of any developing country would be enhanced if
the complementary policies are followed. Among the more important of these are: first,
strengthening the banking system, diversifying financial intermediation through both banks

level and among the national level regulators at the international level are also attracting

sector, irrespective of whether banking is in public or private sector. The health of banking
sector is critical for many reasons, one of them being stability in external sector.
In India, the complementary policies considered essential have been identified by the
Committee of Capital Account Convertibility (1997). The Committee observed that while
there were benefits of a more open capital account, it could also impose pressures on the
financial system. Hence the Committee indicated certain sign posts or preconditions for a
more open capital account and these are: fiscal consolidation, inflation-mandate and
Of particular significance in regard to complementary policies that are relevant to
management of capital account are standards and codes being evolved and monitored by
several agencies, including in particular IMF, World Bank, BIS, Financial Stability Forum
etc. (
Each country will no doubt, benchmark their existing practices against the international codes
and standards, and consider their appropriateness, extent of application, nature of adaptation
needed, relative priorities, etc. Several of the actions suggested require tremendous effort in
regard to many developing countries and if full compliance is desirable for further

and codes and an assessment in so far as India is concerned; some of these reports are
Outlook
It is clear that avoiding crises is ultimately a national responsibility. The impact of instability
in times of crises appears at this stage of global environment to largely be borne by the home
or domestic public sector rather than the global private sector. Moreover, the burden of such
an asymmetrical impact is more painful on developing countries, especially the poorer ones.
Hence, in this context, the distinct preference for stability, on the part of some developing
countries needs to be appreciated. Such a preference towards stability also argues for
managing their capital account regime. Such regimes could have a mix of control, regulatory
and liberal elements as appear most appropriate from time to time, to the national authorities
who are accountable to the people for possible crises. In such a mix, there is merit in avoiding
controls, but taking recourse to regulatory measures, while pursuing the liberalisation
Within this overall framework, the progress in capital account liberalisation would perhaps
depend on several international and domestic factors. Some of them are : First, the progress
in global co-operation and understanding on relevant codes and practices to assure financial
stability. Secondly, the quality of assurances and support from international financial
community in general and International Financial Institutions in particular, if crises were to
occur. Thirdly, the nature of burden-sharing arrangements with private sector in case of
crises. Fourth, the progress of institutional and financial market developments in the country
