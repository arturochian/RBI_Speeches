?Challenges and implications of Basel II for AsiaMr. Chairman and friends,I am thankful to the organisers for inviting me to participate in the annualmeetings of the Asian Development Bank and give my views on Basel II in theAsian context. I have a special affinity to the city of Hyderabad. I started in thiscity as a Research Scholar in 1960, then taught as a lecturer in OsmaniaUniversity till 1964, and later, was the Collector and District Magistrate ofHyderabad city in 1976-77. Again, I worked here as Secretary in Finance andPlanning Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh for most part of thedecade of 1980s. So, as a Hyderabadi, I extend a warm welcome to thedistinguished delegates from all over the world.Basel I : Voluntarism and gradualism in IndiaLet me start with Basel I framework for capital adequacy, which wasintroduced in 1988. The Basel I framework was designed to establish minimumlevels of capital for internationally active banks. However, its simplicityencouraged over 100 countries across the world to not only adopt the Basel Iframework but also apply it across the entire banking segment without restrictingit to the internationally active banks. Thus, the voluntary adoption of Basel Iframework by several countries has made it, de facto, a globally acceptedstandard, though not all countries are fully compliant with all the aspects.Adopting our general approach of gradualism, we in India haveimplemented the Basel I framework with effect from 1992-93 which was,however, spread over three years – banks with branches abroad were requiredto comply fully by end March 1994 while the other banks were required tocomply by end March 1996. Further, India responded to the 1996 amendment tothe Basel I framework, which required banks to maintain capital for market riskexposures, by initially prescribing various surrogate capital charges for theserisks between 2000 and 2002. These were replaced with the capital charges asrequired under the Basel I framework in June 2004, which became effective from                                                * Remarks by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor at the Seminar on “Challenges and implications ofthBasel II for Asia” as a part of the Asian Development Bank's 39 Annual Meeting of the Board ofGovernors in Hyderabad on May 3, 2006. He is thankful to S/Shri K. Damodaran, GeneralManager and Anand Sinha, Executive Director for the assistance provided.March 2005. We have gone a step further than the Basel I requirement and haverequired the banks in India to maintain capital charge for market risks on their‘Available for Sale’ portfolio also with effect from March 2006. We continue tosee considerable merit in pursuing a policy of gradualism in harmonising ourregulations with the global standards.Basel II : Benefits and major issuesThe complexity of Basel II arises from several options available and theseare well known. Consequently, many of the countries which have voluntarilyadopted Basel I also view these issues with considerable caution. Compared toBasel I, the revised framework, namely Basel II, is considered to be highlycomplex, making its understanding and implementation a challenge to both theregulatory and the regulated community.Dangers of premature adoptionSince the revised Framework has been designed to provide options forbanks and banking systems worldwide, the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision (BCBS) acknowledges that moving toward its adoption in the nearfuture may not be the first priority for all non-G10 supervisory authorities in termsof what is needed to strengthen their supervision. Each national supervisor isexpected to consider carefully the benefits of the revised Framework in thecontext of its domestic banking system when developing a timetable andapproach for implementation.The views of the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fundclearly indicate that premature adoption of Basel II in countries with limitedcapacity could inappropriately divert resources from the more urgent priorities,ultimately weakening rather than strengthening supervision. They agreed thatcountries should give priority first to strengthening their financial systemscomprising institutions, markets and infrastructure and focus on achievinggreater level of compliance with the Basel Core Principles. Against thisbackground, the IMF has cautioned that Fund staff should avoid conveying theperception that countries will be criticised for not moving to adopt the Basel IIframework. They have urged staff to be completely candid when asked to assesscountries' readiness to move to Basel II and to indicate clearly the risks ofmoving too quickly and too ambitiously.Varying implementation plans across jurisdictions in Asia-PacificThe implementation plans in regard to Basel II, as far as Asia-Pacific isconcerned, may be broadly divided into three ranges – one, where the simplestapproaches and the most advanced approaches are available at the time of firstimplementation (Australia, Korea, Singapore, New Zealand); second, where thesimplest approaches are available initially and at least one of the most advancedapproaches is available within a year or two thereafter (Hong Kong, Japan,Indonesia, Thailand); and third, where the simplest approaches are allowedinitially and the date of availability of the most advanced approaches is yet to beannounced or are available after more than two years (China, India, Malaysia,and Philippines). Further, one might be able to link the choice of the above broadranges to the extent of share of foreign banks in the respective banking sectors.It is observed that the banking systems where foreign banks account for asignificant share in the banking assets (Singapore, Hong Kong) are reflecting adesire to adopt the advanced approaches ahead of those territories where theforeign bank share is not significant (India). One might also see a similar trend inrespect of countries which might remain on Basel I for a longer period beforemigrating to Basel II (China).Implementation in IndiaThe policy approach to financial sector in India is that the ultimate goalshould be to conform to the best international standards and in the process, theemphasis is on gradual harmonisation with the international best practices.Consistent with this approach, for Basel II also, currently all commercial banks inIndia are expected to start implementing Basel II with effect from March 31, 2007– though a marginal stretching beyond this date should not be ruled out in viewof the latest indications on the state of preparedness. While consideringimplementation of Basel II, special attention was given to the differences indegrees of sophistication and development of the banking system and it wasdecided that they will initially adopt the Standardised Approach for credit risk andthe Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk. After adequate skills aredeveloped, both by the banks and also by the supervisors, some of the banksmay be allowed to migrate to the Internal Rating Based (IRB) Approach.As per normal practice in regard to all changes in financial sector, andwith a view to ensuring a particularly smooth migration to Basel II, a consultativeand participative approach has been adopted for both - designing andimplementing Basel II.On current indications, implementation of Basel II will require more capitalfor banks in India due to the fact that operational risk is not captured under BaselI, and the capital charge for market risk was not prescribed until recently. Thecushion available in the system, which at present has a Capital to Risk AssetsRatio (CRAR) of over 12 per cent, provides for some comfort but the banks areexploring various avenues for meeting the capital requirements under Basel II.The Reserve Bank has, for its part, issued policy guidelines enabling issuance ofseveral instruments by the banks viz., innovative perpetual debt instruments,perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, redeemable cumulative preferenceshares and hybrid debt instruments  so as to enhance their capital raisingoptions.Three-track approach for implementation in IndiaIn India, we have 85 commercial banks, which account for about 78%(total assets) of the financial sector; over 3000 cooperative banks, which accountfor 9%; and 196 Regional Rural Banks, which account for 3%. Taking intoaccount the size, complexity of operations, relevance to the financial sector,need to ensure greater financial inclusion and the need for having an efficientdelivery mechanism, the capital adequacy norms applicable to these entitieshave been maintained at varying levels of stringency. One might say that we areadopting a three-track approach with regard to capital adequacy rules.  Giventhe differential risk appetite across banks and their business philosophies, it islikely that banks would ‘self select’ their own approach, which in turn, is likely toengender a stabilising influence on the system as a whole.On the first track, the commercial banks are required to maintain capitalfor both credit and market risks as per Basel I framework; the cooperative banks,on the second track, are required to maintain capital for credit risk as per Basel Iframework and through surrogates for market risk; the Regional Rural Banks, onthe third track, have a minimum capital requirement which is, however, not onpar with the Basel I framework. Consequently, we have a major segment ofsystemic importance on a full Basel I framework, a portion of the minor segmentpartly on Basel I framework, and a smaller segment on a non-Basel framework.It is for the same reasons that, at least initially, a similar diversity may bevisible in the Indian banking segment even after the commercial banks beginimplementing Basel II framework in March 2007. In the post-March 2007scenario we may witness Basel II, Basel I and non-Basel entities operatingsimultaneously in the Indian banking system.  It is useful to note that asomewhat similar choice has been exercised even in the USA where one is likelyto see at least Basel II and Basel I-A entities operating simultaneously. Similarly,even amongst the Basel II entities, it is likely that banks will be implementingvarious combinations of the multiple options available for computing capitalrequirements for the three major risks. Consequently, we may see Basel IIimplementation as a part of a spectrum of frameworks within which there can beprogressive enhancement of quality amongst different categories.It is likely that on implementation of Basel II, some banks might adopt theIRB Approach for credit risk while some other banks in the same jurisdiction,might adopt the Standardised Approach. Since the IRB Approach is more risksensitive vis-à-vis the Standardised Approach, a small change in the degree ofrisk could result in a large additional capital requirement for the banks followingthe IRB approach - which would dissuade such banks from assuming high-riskexposures. From a systemic point of view, therefore, the banks adopting theStandardised Approach, and consequently, having a greater concentration ofhigh-risk assets in their portfolio, could perhaps become vulnerable in times ofeconomic downturns. These issues would need to be appropriately taken intoaccount while deciding on the implementation of the Basel II.Implementation challenges in developing countriesEven though it has been mentioned in several places that over 100countries had implemented Basel I, the assessments done in 71 countries as apart of Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) have revealed manydeficiencies in the areas of risk management, consolidated supervision andcorrective action for undercapitalised institutions, which are considered to becrucial to sound supervision and proper Basel II implementation. While asupervisory system which is fully or largely compliant with Basel Core Principle6, which incorporates Basel I as the capital adequacy standard, is considerednecessary for moving to Basel II, the assessments reveal that about 37% ofthese countries had not complied with this Core Principle. The remainingcountries were at various stages of compliance. Given this level of compliance,the challenges that are likely to be faced by the developing economies inimplementing the Basel II framework, will be daunting.As acknowledged by the IMF, they do not have adequate internalexpertise to assess and assist Basel II implementation in various jurisdictions.Given the complexities of financial regulation and the added complexities of theBasel II framework, which will have to be specifically tailored to suit the domesticeconomies and the domestic banking systems, the regulators are right ininsisting on the freedom and flexibility for adopting and implementing anappropriate roadmap without being constrained by any external pressures, director indirect. The ideal solution for managing a complex task of this nature isthrough mutual cooperation and assistance amongst the central banks.Dangers of asymmetry in financial intermediationA likely scenario, which might arise post-Basel II implementation, is theasymmetry in regulatory regime amongst the competing broad segments of thefinancial sector viz., banking, securities and insurance sectors. While thecommercial banking sector is expected to migrate to the Basel II regimen soon,the other segments are not likely to be subjected to the same or similar disciplineunless they are a part of a banking group, where Basel II regimen would applyindirectly through the parent bank. Hence, we are likely to see some scope forregulatory arbitrage amongst the three broad segments unless the regulators ofthese segments also recognise the need and relevance of a comparableprescription for those segments. The Joint Forum has taken some initiatives inthis direction, which may have to be pursued further to achieve parity in the levelof regulatory burden across the three sectors, which compete amongstthemselves for the business of financial intermediation.Basel II and Social dimensions The three-track theme to Basel II implementation, which I had mentionedearlier, might give rise to scope for regulatory arbitrage within the bankingsystem. This would, however, not be of much concern in the Indian context onaccount of the relatively insignificant size of the non Basel II entities and theirrelevance from the systemic perspective. While the desire would be to reducethe scope for regulatory arbitrage, we may have to strike a delicate balance toensure that this desire does not constrain the non-Basel II entities fromdischarging their respective specified roles in the national economies viz.,achieving greater financial inclusion, playing a developmental role, and acting asconduits for credit delivery to the neglected sectors. I think, the multi-track themefor Basel II implementation and the consequent handling of regulatory arbitrageand stability issues may be reflected in other similarly placed emerging marketeconomies as well.A roadmap approach for implementation of Basel IIIn the light of experience gained by us, it appears that the balanceof advantage would lie in favour of encouraging the central banks / bankingsector regulators to implement Basel II framework at their own pace and in amanner as appropriate to their economies, banking systems and supervisorymechanisms. It is also possible that the multilateral development agencies areyet to get fully equipped to assist in Basel II implementation. Ideally each countrymay devise a road map to be implemented flexibly taking account of the countrycontext. In Telugu, the official language of the State of Andhra Pradesh, we say‘samayam, sanderbham mukhyam’. It means timing and context are vital foranything and, in my submission, it also includes Basel II in Asia.Thank you.
