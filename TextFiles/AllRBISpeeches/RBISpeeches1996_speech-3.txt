1PROSPECTS FOR SAVING AND GROWTHY.V. ReddyAt the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to the organisers for givingme this opportunity to be with you.  Though I belong to Andhra Pradesh, I hadknown Mr. Doshi personally since we interacted professionally.  In fact, a few daysbefore his unfortunate trip to Davos in January 1994, we were together for a coupleof days in Hyderabad in a Retreat for Secretaries to Government of India and ChiefSecretaries of States.  Mr. Doshi displayed in his participation in the deliberations, adeep understanding of developmental issues, especially in the area of industry, anda very friendly, and warm temperament.  It is that memory, apart from thepersuasive skills of the respected Principal who made me accept this invitation.I owe an apology to the organisers and many of you for changing theschedule from 9th to 16th December. Though I had agreed to send the script of myaddress for 9th, I was advised by the organisers to have the pleasure of meetingyou all. I am thankful to them for the courtesy shown to me.Since we know that Mr. Doshi devoted a large part of his life to the issues ofdevelopment, we decided that it would be appropriate to speak on Prospects forSaving and Growth-naturally in our own economy, on the eve of the Ninth Five YearPlan.I would like to start with an account of the performance of our economy interms of saving and growth in the Plan era and more particularly in the post-reformperiod.  We would also see how our performance compares with some otherdeveloping countries.  We could then move on to a detailed assessment of theprospects for household, corporate and public sector saving which togetherconstitute domestic saving, typically financing over ninety per cent of ourinvestment. An assessment of foreign saving is also necessary, both for completingthe picture about investment and for its significances to our growth.  This shouldhelp us in identifying critical issues in determining growth scenarios.  In particular, Iwould like to flag what may be termed as "new realities" that should be noted bypolicy-makers in planning for an appropriate level as well as composition of saving                                               1  Lalit Doshi Memorial Foundation Lecture (organised by  Department of Economics, St. Xavier's College, under the St.Xavier s College Series) delivered by Dr. Y.V.Reddy, Deputy Governor, on December 16, 1996 at Mumbai.and linking them with growth-scenarios.  I hope to conclude by mentioning, what Iconsider as the most critical factor that would make or mar our optimisticprojections.Let me, at the outset, note that there are methodological problems inestimating savings, especially in respect of households and corporates.  Publicsector saving is essentially based on government accounts and balance sheets ofpublic enterprises but we need to also include local governments' financial positions.While the methodological issues are being looked into by an official committeeunder the Chairmanship of Professor Raja Chehlliah,  I would make some use of thedata that we have inured to focus on the logic of assessing prospects for saving andgrowth.Saving PerformanceWhat has been our performance in terms of saving?First, gross domestic saving as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product(GDP) at current market prices doubled from 10.3 per cent in the First Plan to 20.6per cent in the Seventh Plan.  This helped the gross domestic investment rate torise from 10.7 per cent to 23.1 per cent between the First and the Seventh Plan.  Inthe Eighth Plan, the saving rate is 22.3 per cent during the first three years with24.4. per cent in 1994-95.Second, though there has been a long-run rising trend, the saving ratewitnessed a large year-to-year fluctuation.  During the 1950s, the saving rate variedbetween the peak of 13.9 per cent to a low of 8.2 per cent, the range of variationwas 15.3 per cent and 12.2 per cent during the 1960s, 23.2 per cent and 15.4 percent during 1970s and 22.2 per cent and 18.2 per cent during the 1980s. During thefirst half of the 1990s, the degree of variation declined somewhat.  The peak savingrate of 24.4 per cent in 1994-95 was more than 3 percentage points higher than thelow of 21.2 per cent in 1992-93.Third, the household saving has been the mainstay of our domestic savingperformance.  As a percentage of GDP, household saving grew from 8.4 per cent in1960-61 to 19.8 percent in 1990-91 and the average for Eighth Plan so far is 17.70per cent.  Household saving contributed 66 per cent of total gross saving in 1960-61, which increased to 84 per cent in 1990-91 but declined to 79 per cent in theEighth Plan so far.Fourth, saving in the financial assets showed an impressive growth from 2.8per cent of GDP in 1960-61 to 11.1 per cent in 1994-95, which increased its share inthe total household saving from 33.5 per cent to 58.9 per cent during this period.Fifth, the share of private corporate sector in total saving, which fluctuatedwidely during the 1960s and 1970s, showed smart recovery in the 1990s :  its sharedeclined from 13.4 per cent in 1960-61 to 7.9 per cent in 1980-81, but recovered to11.8 per cent in 1990-91, and moved impressively up to 15.6 per cent in 1994-95. Interms of percentage to GDP, private corporate saving which remained almoststagnant at 1.7 per cent between 1960-61 and 1980-81, increased by over onpercentage point to 2.8 per cent in 1990-91 and by a further percentage point toreach 3.8 [per cent by 1994-95.Sixth, perhaps the most disquieting aspect of the saving behaviour in theIndian economy is the trend erosion of public sector saving over the years.  Publicsector saving rate which averaged 2.7 per cent in 1960s, 3.7 per cent in 1970s and3.0 per cent in 1980s, declined sharply to1.3 per cent in the first half of 1990s.  Thedeterioration in the public sector saving performance partly stemmed from theemergence of negative saving of the Government administration since 1984-85 andthe increasing magnitudes of dis-saving since then.  The negative saving of theGovernment administration which amounted to 1.43 per cent of GDP during 1985-86 to 1989-90 increased to 2.6 per cent in the first half of 1990s.Seventh, the non-departmental and departmental public enterprises,however, showed some improvement in their saving performance, with a saving rateof about 4 per cent of GDP during the first half of 1990s.Eighth, foreign saving has played a relatively minor role in financing domesticinvestment in India.  In fact, except for late fifties and sixties, during most of theperiod, foreign saving accounted for less than ten per cent of our investment.Foreign saving as a percentage of GDP averaged 1.5 per cent during the Sixth Planand 2.5 per cent during the Seventh Plan.  It declined to 1.0 per cent in the first fouryears of the Eighth Plan and this is far less than the target of 1.6 per cent envisagedin the Plan.  In the eighth Plan, there is a distinct shift from debt flows to non-debtflows and from short-term maturity debt to longer maturity debt.  The proportion ofprivate capital flow increased as compared to official flows.  The access of privatesector to foreign saving has also increased.There has been a lively debate on the effect of reform measures undertakenrecently, on the domestic saving.  The data available for the three years of the post-reform period would not give a firm basis for reaching any definitive conclusions onthis issue.  For, the limited number of observations is limited and the period exhibitsperverse effects of the initial shock introduced by policy regime shift.  Nonetheless,one could draw some important features of our saving-investment performance inthe post-reform era i.e. from 1992-93.First, the average gross saving rate of 22.3 per cent during 1992-93 to 1994-95 does not seem to be promising against the backdrop of the average saving rateof 23.2 per cent during 1990-91 and 1991-92 and 20.6 per cent during the SeventhPlan.  Excluding 1994-95, when the saving rate shot up to the historical peak of24.4. per cent, the average saving rate would drop to a little over 21 per cent in thepost-reform period.Secondly, for quite sometime, the household saving rate has been hoveringin the range of 17 to 20 per cent, with the peak rate occurring at 19.8 per cent in1990-91.  In the post-reform period, and starting with 199-93, the average savingrate seems to be plateauing off around 18 to 19 per cent.Thirdly, financially saving of the household sector during the period 1992-93to 1994-95 averaged 10.1 per cent of GDP compared to 9.4 per cent during 1990-91and 1991-92 and 7.6 per cent during the Seventh Plan. Therefore, much of whatcould be expected as improvement in household saving rate, would have to come inthe form of financial assets, and the specific policy initiatives to promote saving inthese assets.Fourthly, the saving rate of the private corporate sector averaged 3.4 per centduring 1992-93 to 1994-95, which is about 70 per cent higher than the ratio of 2 percent during the Seventh Plan.Fifthly, the negative saving of the government administrative departmentincreased from 1.43 per cent in the Seventh Plan to 2.7 per cent during the period1992-93 to 1994-95.  This, of course, is a reflection of the rising magnitude ofrevenue deficit in the general government budget, which was 3.3 per cent of GDPfor center alone during this period.  However, the saving of public enterprises sectorshowed a distinct improvement, accounting for 3.95 per cent in the post-reform eracompared to 3.78 per cent and 2.43 per cent in the Seventh and Sixth Plans,respectively.Sixthly, the aggregate investment rate in 1960s was 15.6 per cent, and in1970s it was 19.1 per cent.  It was in the 1980s that this rate went up to an averageof 22 per cent, and as a result, the GDP growth rate also edged up to the range of5.5 to 6.0 per cent.  The eighth Plan envisaged an aggregate investment rate ofabout 23.2. per cent, and in the first three years our performance in fractionallyhigher than planned.  Our rate of growth is close to what we planned so far- around5.5 per cent.  The incremental capital output ratio is virtually stagnant at a little overfour, in the Sixth, S3venth and Eighth Plans. Briefly stated, our rate of growth is determined by investment, given asomewhat constant Incremental Capital-Output Ratio (ICOR); and prospects forgrowth will improve only if the domestic saving rate, which is a predominant portionof the investment rate, is raised and efficiency improved.Some ComparisonsIt would be useful to attempt a comparison of our saving and investmentperformance with some of the fast growing Asian Economies.  I will list some forenabling one to obtain policy insights.(a) The domestic saving rate in the Indian economy is far below ascompared with that of the East Asian economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia,Thailand, Singapore, China and Korea.The newly industrialized economies and most of the countries in South-EastAsia exhibit domestic saving rates of over one-third of GDP, among the highest inthe world.  While the average saving rate in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand andKorea was between 35-38 per cent during 1991-95, that of China and Singaporeranged between 40-48 per cent.  An exception has been the Philippines where thesaving rate fell from 24 per cent in 1995 for several reasons including the politicalturmoil in the 1980s and a series of natural disasters.(b) High domestic saving rates, which have recently been supplementedby large inflows of external capital are major factors in the economic success ofmany of the Asian economies.  However, despite the recent increase in externalcapital inflows, domestic saving continues to finance about 90 per cent ofinvestment.(c) A notable feature of the high saving performance of the East Asianeconomies is the high rate of saving by the government sector in these economies.For instance, in  Malaysia, government saving showed a drastic improvement from1.4 per cent of GDP in 1985 to 5.7 per cent of 1993 and constituted around 16 percent of gross domestic saving rate in the economy.(d) In contrast to the South-East Asian economies, our South Asianneighbors have very low domestic saving rate, ranging between 8.0-15.0 per cent ofGDP in 1995.  In contrast, investment in these countries ranged between 15.5-26.3per cent, reflecting their heavy dependence on external assistance to meet theirinvestment needs.(e) The achievement of high rates of growth in South-East Asianeconomies is mainly explained by the faster rate of capital accumulation.  Theincremental capital output ratios, implied from the Gross Domestic Investment andreal GDP growth rates in respect of Indonesia (5.17), Thailand (5.04), Singapore(5.07) and Korea (5.44) during 1991-95, were higher than that in India.  China withan average ICOR of about 3.6 during the period 1991-95, however showed higherrate of productivity gains than some of the East Asian economies ad India.Nevertheless, on the productivity front, the achievement of the Indian economy inthe recent period is comparable with the East Asian economies and otherdeveloping countries.  This reflects the idea that the constraints to growth of theIndian economy stems mainly from the slow rate of increase in capital stock.  Theconstraint would be greatly eased if there is a simultaneous improvement inproductivity.Household SavingThere are a number of factors that influence the household saving.  It wouldbe useful to recall each of the factors and their relevance to our conditions onjudgmental basis and to focus on those factors that are amenable to policymeasures.First, the growth in income is an important factor in determining the savingrate.  This appears to be equally true in India, particularly on the basis of trends inthe recent past.Secondly, income distribution has an impact on the saving rate.Redistribution policy may temporarily dampen the saving rate.  But the secondary ordynamic effects of such redistribution on efficiency could be different, though thismay not be easily amendable to quantifications.  There could, therefore, be aconflict between policies to bring about immediate improvements in saving andpolicies towards redistribution.  Further, it is often argued that globalisation results inconsumerism which in turn reduces saving rate.  This impressionistic observation is,however, not supported by empirical evidence.Thirdly, macro-economic stability in general and inflation in particular isknown to have an impact on saving.  There are controversies as to the exact natureof the relationship between the two.  However, the rate of inflation beyond a point orvolatility in prices does have a negative impact on saving.Fourthly, the efficiency of financial intermediation has a strong relationshipwith the saving rate.  In particular, financial saving is promoted by ensuring anadequate return relative to other physical and other forms of s saving.  It isnecessary to ensure that savers perceive that there is not erosion in the real valueof their saving:  this will to an extent be taken care of if the interest rate regime is notartificially repressed.  Some studies have shown that in India there is a positiverelationship between interest rate and financial saving.  There are, however, somewho argue that interest rate has no impact on saving; more important there are afew who argues that a large increase in interest rate might even adversely affectsaving, since a target income can be obtained with a lower level of saving.Empirical evidence is not clear on the direction of the impact, but in our case areasonable return on saving seems to enhance the financial saving.Fifthly, it is also argued in some quarters that rapid improvement ingovernment saving dampens the household saving.  Empirical evidence in generaland available findings in India do not indicate such an inverse relationship.Sixthly, it is noticed that higher the proportion of working population to thetotal population, greater is the saving rate.  On this count we must be aiming forlarger employment opportunities which are likely to enhance the saving rate.Seventhly, there are strong social influences such as the role of extendedfamily and the societal values placed on the saving rate in terms of inter-generational obligations.  In this regard we continue to have a strong bias in favourof saving.Eighthly, availability of insurance and tax benefits are also known to have apositive effect on saving.  Studies have shown that tax benefits have contributedsubstantially to the increase in financial saving.Finally, a factor generally contributing to higher saving rate relates to whatmay be termed as contractual saving, mainly PF and other contributions.  There issubstantial scope for increasing contractual savings in our country.  This could bean important instrument for improving long term financial saving.  Such savings,being of long-term tenor, are critical to finance our infrastructural needs now.In brief, therefore, it is clear that the level of saving rate and the improvementin saving rate depend on a number of socio-economic  and other related matters.  Inthe short and medium term, however, it is the policy related aspect that determineshousehold saving.  Assuming a continued output growth of  6-7 per cent, and aninflation rate of about 6 per cent, coupled with improvements in the financialintermediation, it is reasonable to expect the household saving rate to improvefurther.  However, supplementary initiatives in terms of policy instruments providingfor tax incentives and improvements in contractual saving may be required toensure that the household saving rates is around 19 to 20 per cent.Private Corporate SavingThe growth of private corporate saving is determined as much by macro-environment as by micro-conditions at the firm-level.  There are a few factorsrelevant to us in making an assessment of prospects.First, the growth of corporate sector as a whole, which in our case has beenaccelerating in the post-reform period.Second, the growth of corporate income which had seen large increases for awhile was followed by some deceleration.  However, competitive pressures, apartfrom infrastructural bottlenecks, could result in thinner margins for corporate, unlesscompensated by efficiency.Third, the tax treatment has a strong influence on incentives to plough backprofits.  In fact, improvements in corporate saving in the recent past, could beattributed at least in part, to a more favorable tax regime.Finally, macro-economic stability and policy-stance especially in regard tointerest rates and exchange rates would influence a corporate's decision to investand to plough back profits.  In terms of prospects a favorable macro-economicenvironment should help corporate saving to increase substantially from theaverage rate of 3.4 per cent in the Eighth Plan so far - which is itself a greatimprovement over the Seventh Plan average of 2 per cent.  Hence the corporatesaving could be in the range of 4.0 to 4.5 per cent of GDP in the next Plan period.Public SavingPublic sector saving will have an important bearing on the total savingperformance of the country, and the success in this regard would depend on strongfiscal management.  The contribution of public sector saving has to be analysed atthe center, state and local government levels and in terms of government sector andpublic enterprise sector.In regard to government administration, the tax-GDP ratio of the centre hadcome down an average of 11.2 per cent in late eighties to 10.2 per cent during thelast five years.  This is partly explicable by the fact that the adjustment processrequired substantial reduction in customs duty.  Since much progress has alreadybeen made in this area, it should be possible to expect an upward movement in thisratio.  Coupled with efforts to extend the tax base and inculcating basic complianceculture, it should be possible to target a ratio that was achieved in late eighties at11.2 per cent.  With a healthy growth in GDP, it should be possible to achieve ahigher ratio of 11.5 per cent.  However, in regard to state governments, their tax-GDP ratio has been 5.7 per cent and considering the inelastic nature of theirresource base it may be unrealistic to expect any substantial improvement in thisratio and at best 6 per cent could be hoped for.The critical part of the fiscal management relates to expenditure.  In theCentral Government, the non-discretionary expenditures, particularly interestpayments, account for the single largest item.  More important, the debt alreadyincurred is in the overhang and interest rates have already been set on these debts.Hence, the scope for reduction in expenditure on this account is limited and isgoverned by the incremental cost of additional borrowings.  The cost of such freshborrowings would critically depend on inflation, particularly the inflationaryexpectations as well as the extent of fiscal deficit.  Similarly, the wage bill in thegovernment is essentially a committed expenditure except at the increment.  Thedirect and indirect subsidies would appear to be a major area of discretionaryexpenditure. However, there has been a substantial under-funding of maintenancein the past, necessitating adequate provisions in future to avoid erosion of the valueof the capital assets both at the central and state levels.As regards state governments, it will be difficult to envisage substantialreduction in expenditure if adequate emphasis has to be given on education andhealth.  In fact, most of the expenditure on these heads are in terms of wages andhence in the nature of non-discretionary expenditure.  The cost recovery, particularlyin the area of water will be critical to finances of the state.  Overall, however, thefunctioning of the state governments is closely linked to the delivery of services andimprovement in efficiency is more important than reduction in expenditure.  Indeed,since the state governments provide most of the public goods, including law andorder, it would be in appropriate to suggest reductions in this expenditure.In respect of public enterprises, their contribution during the ninth Plan maybe enhanced if efficiency improves and market orientation is assured.  At the sametime, dividends from the equities held by the Government in the central publicenterprises would be reduced to the extent privatization has occurred.  Incidentally,there may be a need to have a higher dividend than in the past to maintain theirattractiveness in the capital market.As regards, state public enterprises, the critical factors relate to user fee orcost recovery, particularly in regard to Electricity Boards and TransportUndertakings which together have about two-third of the investment andemployment instate public enterprises.  Unless there is a dramatic change, theircontribution to saving would continue to be negative.To assess the prospect, it would be necessary to know that the public sectorsaving assumed for the Eighth Plan was 2 per cent of GDP while the realization sofar is 1.3 per cent.  Hence it is reasonable to assume that the public sector savingwould be in the range of 2-2.4 per cent.Foreign SavingThe level of foreign saving will depend as much on our own policyenvironment as on the global developments.  In assessing the prospects, threefactors are important.First, the current account deficit should be such that it can be financed bynormal capital flows.  Since the share of foreign trade is relatively small, we shouldbe cautious in setting the level of the sustainable current account-GDP ratio.Second, the flow of foreign saving would be enhanced if the economicfundamentals are regarded as good.  Since domestic saving forms part of suchfundamentals it being at a comfortable level would be of help.  Foreign saving thuswould not be a substitute but a supplement.Third, the overall creditability and sustainability of macroeconomic policiesmatter a great deal for a sustained flow of foreign saving.  The policy and regulatoryenvironment needed for attracting large foreign saving should also take into accountthe time needed to prepare the local institutions and industry to compete andcollaborate. No doubt, this is a transitional phenomenon, which may affect the earlypart of the Ninth Plan.It may, therefore, be realistic to assume foreign saving in the range of 2.0 to2.4 per cent of GDP as against the Eighth Plan target of 1.6 per cent (and actualbeing far less due to adjustment programme).ScenariosFrom the analysis, it is very clear that, under the most optimistic scenario thesaving would be 20 per cent in respect of households; 4.5 per cent in regard tocorporate sector; 2.4 per cent in respect of public sector and 2.4 per cent in respectof foreign saving. This would give a saving rate of 29.3 per cent. Assuming thatICOR would be four, we could aim for a growth of 7.3 per cent. However, under notso optimistic scenario, the growth rate would be lower. Assuming the ICOR to be 4per cent, a 6.5 per cent growth would be possible even if the overall investment rateis 26 per cent. This is the minimum that one needs to aim at. As Dr. Rangarajan,Governor, Reserve Bank of India has mentioned in Calcutta, "Over the medium termto maintain the growth rate of 6.5 per cent or even better, we need to address twomajor constraints. One is with respect to saving and the other with respect toinfrastructure facilities. Given the need to contain the current account deficit ataround 2 per cent of GDP, a high growth rate can be sustained only if the domesticsaving rate goes up. Among the components of saving, the one that wouldparticularly need attention will be public sector saving."New RealitiesIn making any assessment of saving and growth, it is necessary to recognisethe general reform ambience in which the economy is placed.First, there are constraints on the freedom of action in the context of theglobalisation of Indian economy.Secondly, reform implies larger role for the government in social sector andperhaps infrastructure, and in both, the role of the states would be larger than that ofthe Centre. These should be reflected in investment needs and expenditureprojections.Thirdly, more than direct investment in public sector, the role of policypreconditions and procedures for achieving faster growth with stabilisation needs tobe recognised.Fourthly, the importance of price stability in the context of globalisation andpossible adverse implications for inflationary expectation and the interest ratesshould be appreciated. Price stability is critical not only as an 'anti-poverty measure'but also for maintaining a competitive level of real exchange rate in the economy,since our trade-partners are moving towards low inflation targets. It is alsonecessary for sustaining the desired rate of growth.Fifthly, the analysts of our economy would look at both the quantitative andqualitative dimensions of fiscal reform. Reducing fiscal deficit by constraining capitalexpenditures could harm the growth process, particularly in the transition towardseffective private sector participation. Also, reducing fiscal deficit by constrainingprovision of public goods, especially education and health, would be similarlycounter-productive. In effect, hard choices have to be made between subsidy forpower and primary education as also between subsidy for water and primary health.When we speak of growth scenarios, there is a justifiable concern for povertyissues. Here, we may recall what Professor Suresh Tendulkar has recently said: "Inthe Indian context, however, competitive populism practiced by all political partieswould end up providing short-term palliatives against poverty at the cost of the long-term cure i.e., rapid growth, because the mostly non-poor, politically vocal andinfluential organised sector workers have been successfully evading the pains ofstabilisation and structural adjustment. Obviously, a slow-down in the rate ofeconomic growth is the inevitable consequence, with adverse impact on the long-term cure for poverty." Perhaps Professor Tendulkar is suggesting that policymakers have to tackle what has been described as "the tyranny of ten per cent," i.e.of the proportion of work force in the organised sector.The Critical IssueThe prospects are bright if we can ensure sound macro-economic policiescoupled with effective institutional as well as regulatory measures operating at themicro-level. There is also need to ensure quick responses to global developmentsas well as market realities within the country.In the Ninth Plan period, the rewards of sound macro-economic managementappear to be high. More important, the penalty for inappropriate or delayed policyresponses and ineffective instruments could be severe.
