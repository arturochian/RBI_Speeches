Evolution of Central Banking in India*Rakesh MohanI must congratulate the organizers for choosing this important topic fordeliberation in this seminar. I have great pleasure in mentioning that the themeof the Report on Currency and Finance - 2004-05, prepared by the staff of theReserve Bank of India (RBI), is also that of evolution of Central Banking in India(RBI, 2005a). In going through the process of compilation of the Report, I havefound the evolutionary process of central banking all over the world and also thatin India to be very interesting and informative. The most striking feature ofcentral bank functioning both across time and over countries in acontemporaneous manner, is not how similar their functions are or have been,but how heterogeneous they are and how their functions have constantlyevolved over the changing times. My interest in tracking the evolution of centralbanking in India has also been triggered by the recent publication of the historyof the Reserve Bank of India in three volumes, covering the period 1935 - 1981(RBI, 2005b).I. Global Evolution of Central BankingEvolution of central banking is essentially a twentieth centuryphenomenon as there were only about a dozen central banks in the world at theturn of the twentieth century. In contrast, at present, there are nearly 160 centralbanks. This is not surprising since the need for central banks obviously emergedas banking became more complex, while becoming an increasingly importantpart of the economy over time.  The many vicissitudes experienced by banksand their depositors inevitably led to cries for their regulation.  Second, centralbanks are essentially a nation state phenomenon, and hence proliferated asnation states themselves emerged and multiplied: again a twentieth centuryphenomenon. Third, it is useful to recall some of the reasons for the origin ofcentral banks: to issue currency; to be a banker and lender to the government: toregulate and supervise the banks and financial entities: and to serve as a lender-of-last-resort.This is ironic since much of the current professional thinking is that acentral bank should be independent of government, should no longer be a debtmanager of the government, and should not regulate or supervise commercialbanks. The new objective function assigned to the central bank is to focus onprice stability, with financial stability as an additional objective in some cases.                                                * This is based on the lecture delivered by the Deputy Governor at the seminar organizedby the London School of Economics and the National Institute of Bank Management atMumbai on January 24, 2006. The assistance of Charan Singh and Partha Ray ispreparation of the speech is gratefully acknowledged.This is perhaps not surprising since price stability was historically achieved,along with preservation of currency value, through the gold standard, and laterthrough the dollar anchor and its relation to gold. The world lost its monetaryanchor on August 15, 1971 when the US decided to delink the dollar from gold,and has been floundering ever since in search of a new anchor.After the convulsions of the 1960s and 1970s, mainly related to thefinancing of the Vietnam war, the expansion of world liquidity, and the ensuingsomewhat enduring inflation, along with Latin American fiscal and monetaryexpansion, the new holy grail is  independence of the central bank, a conceptthat is becoming almost synonymous with inflation targeting. And here, though Iam too new to central banking to really offer a definitive view, I have to admit to acertain skepticism related to the current fashion among central bankers. Twopertinent questions are natural to be asked. First, why is it so obvious thatcentral banks should abandon their ‘parents’, the sovereign government? Onequick explanation could be that the central banks have ‘come-of-age’ in recentyears. But then, some instances like the case of two currencies in Iraq in the1990s and that of the Bank of Japan in recent years provide a contrary view tothe ‘come-of-age’ hypothesis (King, 2004). Second, is it really the case thatsupervision and regulation of banks by the central bank leads to conflict ofinterest? In consideration of this conflict, the Financial Services Authority wasestablished in the UK in 2000, and a number of countries have followed suit.What I would like to do today is to explore some of these issues as they relate toIndia at the present time.II. The Historical Antecedents of Central Banking in IndiaIn India, the efforts to establish a banking institution with central bankingcharacter dates back to the late 18th century. The Governor of Bengal in BritishIndia recommended the establishment of a General Bank in Bengal and Bihar.thThe Bank was set up in 1773 but it was short-lived. It was in the early 20century that, consequent to the recommendations of the ChamberlainCommission (1914) proposing the amalgamation of the three Presidency Banks,the Imperial Bank of India was formed in 1921 to additionally carry out thefunctions of central banking along with commercial banking. In 1926, the RoyalCommission on Indian Currency and Finance (Hilton Young Commission)recommended that the dichotomy of functions and divisions of responsibilities forcontrol of currency and credit should be ended. The Commission suggested theestablishment of a central bank to be called the Reserve Bank of India, whoseseparate existence was considered necessary for augmenting banking facilitiesthroughout the country. The Bill to establish the RBI was introduced in January1927 in the Legislative Assembly, but it was dropped due to differences in viewsregarding ownership, constitution and composition of its Board of Directors.Finally, a fresh Bill was introduced in 1933 and passed in 1934. The RBI Actcame into force on January 1, 1935. The RBI was inaugurated on April 1, 1935as a shareholders’ institution and the Act provided for the appointment by theCentral Government of the Governor and two Deputy Governors. The RBI wasnationalized on January 1, 1949 in terms of the Reserve Bank of India (Transferto Public Ownership) Act, 1948 (RBI, 2005b).The main functions of the RBI, as laid down in the statutes are - a) issueof currency, b) banker to Government, including the function of debtmanagement, and c) banker to other banks. The Preamble to the RBI Act laidout the objectives as “to regulate the issue of bank notes and the keeping ofreserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally tooperate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.”Unusually, and unlike most central banks the RBI was specifically entrusted withan important promotional role since its inception to finance agriculturaloperations and marketing of crops. In fact, the Agricultural Credit Departmentwas created simultaneously with the establishment of the RBI in 1935.The RBI, as a central bank, has always performed the function ofmaintaining the external value of the rupee. Historically, the rupee was linkedwith pound sterling, which continued even after the establishment of the RBI. Itwas only in late September 1975 that the rupee was delinked from poundsterling and the value was determined with reference to a basket of currenciesuntil 1991. The exchange rate regime, soon thereafter, transited from a basket-linked managed float to a market-based system in March 1993, after a shortexperiment with a dual exchange rate regime between March 1992 and February1993.  Prior to the Second World War, India was a net debtor country and theBritish introduced exchange controls to conserve foreign exchange. ExchangeControl was introduced in India on September 3, 1939 on the outbreak of theSecond World War by virtue of the emergency powers derived under thefinancial provisions of the Defence of India Rules, mainly to conserve the non-sterling area currencies and utilize them for essential purposes. Even after theWar, the controls continued mainly to ensure the most prudent use of the foreignexchange resources. However, the vast accumulation of sterling balances duringthe Second World War provided an opportunity for repatriation of the sterlingdebt, an initiative which came at the behest of the RBI.The RBI’s responsibility as bankers’ bank was essentially two-fold. First,it acted as a source of reserves to the banking system and served as the lenderof last resort in an emergency. The second, and more important responsibility,was to ensure that the banks were established and run on sound lines with theemphasis on protection of depositors’ interest. A banking crisis in 1913 revealedmajor weaknesses in the banking system, such as, maintenance of low reservesand large volumes of unsecured advances. Thus, regulation of the bankingsystem was considered essential to maintain stability in the economy. In theinitial years, banks were governed by the Indian Companies Act, 1913 followedby ad hoc enactments, such as the Banking Companies (Inspection) Ordinance,1946 and the Banking Companies (Restriction of Branches) Act, 1946. Asdissatisfaction with bank failures increased the need for a statutory bankregulator became more pressing. Consequently, a special legislation called theBanking Companies Act was passed in March 1949, which was renamed as theBanking Regulation Act in March 1966.III. Development Role of the RBIAs in many developing countries, the central bank is seen as a keyinstitution in bringing about development and growth in the economy. In the initialyears of the RBI before independence, the banking network was thinly spreadand segmented. Foreign banks served foreign firms, the British army and thecivil service. Domestic/Indian banks were linked to domestic business groupsand managing agencies, and primarily did business with their own groups. Thecoverage of institutional lending in rural areas was poor despite the cooperativemovement. Overall financial intermediation was weak. In an agrarian economy,where more than three-fourth of the population lived in the rural areas andcontributed more than half of GDP, a constant and natural concern wasagricultural credit. Therefore, almost every few years a committee wasconstituted to examine the rural credit mechanism. There has perhaps been onecommittee every two or three years for over a hundred years.A clear objective of the development role of the RBI was to raise thesavings ratio to enable the higher investment necessary for growth, in theabsence of efficient financial intermediation and of a well developed capitalmarket.  The view was that the poor were not capable of saving and, given thesmall proportion of the population that was well off, the only way to kick start thesavings and investment process in the country was for government to performboth functions.  Thus the RBI was seen to have a legitimate role to assist thegovernment in starting up several specialized financial institutions in theagricultural and industrial sectors, and to widen the facilities for term finance andfor facilitating the institutionalisation of savings.  A special need was felt foraccelerating industrial investment, particularly with the launching of the SecondFive Year Plan in 1956.   Over time, various term lending industrial financeinstitutions were established with varying degrees of RBI involvement: theIndustrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), State Financial Corporations(SFCs), Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and the Industrial Credit andInvestment Corporation of India (ICICI).The traditional concern with agricultural credit continued and theAgriculture Finance Corporation was established in 1963, followed by itstransformation into the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development in1982 for extending refinance for short, medium and long term finance foragriculture.  The Unit Trust of India was established in 1964 to mobilizeresources from the wider public and to provide an opportunity for retail investorsto invest in the capital market, thereby also aiding capital market development.The National Housing Bank was set up in the late 1980s to develop housingfinance and the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) in the late1990s for infrastructure finance. The Reserve Bank also actively promotedfinancial institutions to help in developing the Government securities market.The Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) was set up in 1988; primarydealers were promoted in the late 1990s; and the Clearing Corporation of Indiawas incorporated in 2001 to upgrade the financial infrastructure in respect ofclearing and settlement of debt instruments and foreign exchange transactions.More recently, the Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment andSettlement System has been constituted in 2005, and the Banking Codes andStandards Board of India in 2006 to develop a comprehensive code of conductfor fair treatment of bank customers.  The RBI has been continuously involved insetting up or supporting these institutions with varying degrees of involvement,including equity contributions and extension of lines of credit.Thus, the developmental role of the RBI has spanned all the decadessince independence and is quite different from central banks in developedcountries.  Although the Reserve Bank was actively involved in setting up manyof these institutions, the general practice has been to hive them off as they cameof age, or if a perception arose of potential conflict of interest.  There can be littledoubt that the establishment of these institutions has helped financialdevelopment in the country greatly, even though some of them have been lessthan successful in their functioning.  It can be argued, of course, that similarinstitutional development could have taken place through private sector efforts orby the Government.  The availability of financial sector expertise in the ReserveBank, however, was instrumental in these tasks being performed over time bythe Reserve Bank.Expansion of BankingIn the initial years of the RBI, considerable progress was made inextending the banking system but there was continuing concern about theoverall accessibility of banking to the needy. In terms of coverage, many ruraland semi-urban areas were yet to be covered by banking services. Thetransformation of the Imperial Bank of India into the State Bank of India in July1955 was mainly motivated by the desire to extend branches across the countryto stimulate banking activity. It was in continuation of the same policy to servethe needs of the developing economy that 14 large banks were nationalized in1969 followed by six more in 1980. The nationalization of banks, mainlyattempted to align banking activities with national concerns and norms, as it wasperceived that the private banks neither understood social responsibilities norobserved social obligations. The general inclination in the 1950s, 1960s and1970s was essentially to get Government to become active in economicactivities where it was felt that the private sector was not able or willing toperform actively. As a result of nationalization, the total number of branches rosefrom 8,262 in 1969 - to 60,220 in 1991 and those in rural areas from 1,833 to35,206. The increased network of branches certainly led to a large expansion ofrural credit. This dimension of nationalisation and expansion had its impact onthe functioning and working of the RBI. Despite such vast expansion, it isinteresting that we still have concern with financial inclusion today.Development of the Payments SystemThe development of a payments system is one development role that iscommon to most central banks. It is well recognized that an efficient paymentand settlement system is essential for a well functioning modern financialsystem. Therefore, in recent years, banks have been making efforts to upgradepayments and settlement systems utilizing the latest technology. One of thecharacteristic features of the Indian economy, historically, has been thewidespread use of cash in the settlement of most financial transactions.  Whilethis has been the trend for several years, it is noteworthy that India hadpioneered the use of non-cash based payment systems long ago, which hadestablished themselves as strong instruments for the conduct of trade andbusiness. The most important form of credit instrument that evolved in India wastermed as ‘Hundis’ and their use was reportedly known since the twelfth century.Hundis were used as instruments of remittance, credit and trade transactions.In modern times, with the development of the banking system and higherturnover in the volume of cheques, the need for an organized cheque clearingsystem emerged. In India, clearing associations were formed in the Presidencytowns in the nineteenth century and the final settlement between member bankswas effected by means of cheques drawn on the Presidency Banks.  With thesetting up of the Imperial Bank in 1921, settlement was done through chequesdrawn on that bank. After the establishment of the RBI in 1935, the ClearingHouses in the Presidency towns were taken over by the RBI, and continued formore than five decades.In recognition of the importance of payment and settlement systems, theRBI had taken upon itself the task of setting up a safe, efficient and robustpayment and settlement system for the country for more than a decade now.  Inthe recent past, the RBI has been placing emphasis on reforms in the area ofpayment and settlement system. It was with this objective that the Real TimeGross Settlement (RTGS) system was planned, which has been operationalisedin March 2004.  The system, once fully operational, in its present form, wouldtake care of all inter-bank transactions and other features would be added soon.In view of the positive response to reforms in the financial sector and thebanking segment also coming of age, the RBI has now taken the policyperspective of migrating away from the actual management of retail paymentand settlement systems.  Thus, for a few years now, the task of setting up newMICR based cheque processing centers has been delegated to the commercialbanks. This approach has yielded good results and the RBI now envisions thenormal processing functions to be managed and operated by professionalorganizations, which could be constituted through participation of commercialbanks.  This would be applicable to the clearing houses as well, which willperform the clearing activities, but the settlement function will continue to restwith the RBI. A beginning has been made in the form of the operationsperformed by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. for effecting the clearingprocesses related to money, government securities and foreign exchangemarkets. Under this arrangement, the RBI will continue to have regulatoryoversight over such functions without actually acting as the service provider. TheRTGS, which provide for funds transfers across participants in electronic modewith reduced risk, will continue to be operated by the RBI.IV. Relationship of the RBI with the GovernmentThe RBI is a banker to the Central Government statutorily and to theState Governments by virtue of specific agreements with each of them. The lossof autonomy of the RBI that took place in early decades was not because of anyconscious decision based on the currently prevalent thinking on the relationshipbetween central banks and the Government, but rather as a consequence ofoverall economic policy then prevailing regarding the appropriate dominant roleof the Government in the economy as a whole.  Thus, it is useful to review therelationship of the Reserve Bank with the Government as it has evolved overtime.The Monetary Fiscal InterfaceIt is common for central banks in developing countries to act as debtmanagers of their respective governments. Central Banks have typicallyfinanced governments through monetisation as and when the need arose forexpansionary fiscal policy which has been often in developing countries. Warfinancing through monetization has also been the norm for developed countries.Such financing has normally had predictable inflationary consequences for theeconomy. The Indian experience has been no different and expansionary fiscalpolicy was indeed financed by resort to automatic monetization, accompanied byfinancial repression and effective loss of central bank autonomy with respect tomonetary policy.In 1951, with the onset of economic planning, the functions of the RBIbecame more diversified. As the central bank of a typical developing countryemancipated from centuries old colonial rule, the RBI had to participate in thenation building process. Fiscal policy assumed the responsibility of triggering aprocess of economic growth through large public investment, facilitated byaccommodative monetary and conducive debt management policies. The RBIplayed a crucial role in bridging the resource gap of the Government in planfinancing by monetising government debt and maintaining interest rates atartificially low levels for government securities to reduce the cost of governmentborrowing.The provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 authorizes the RBIto grant advances to the Government, repayable not later than three monthsfrom the date of advance.  These advances, in principle, were to bridge thetemporary mismatches in the Government’s receipt and expenditure and weremainly intended as tools for Government’s cash management.  However, inpractice, the tool of short-term financing became a permanent source of fundsfor the Government through automatic creation of ad hoc Treasury billswhenever Government’s balances with the RBI fell below the minimum stipulatedbalance. This automatic monetization led to the RBI’s loss of control overcreation of reserve money. In addition, the RBI also created additional ad hocTreasury bills whenever funds were required by the Government. As there wasunbridled expansion of fiscal deficits and the Government was not in a positionto redeem the ad hoc Treasury bills, the RBI was saddled with a large volume ofthese bills constituting a substantial component of monetized deficit. Thisprocess continued from the 1950s to the 1990s.By the end of the 1980s a fiscal-monetary-inflation nexus wasincreasingly becoming evident whereby excessive monetary expansion onaccount of monetization of fiscal deficit fuelled inflation. The RBI endeavored torestrict the monetary impact of budgetary imbalances by raising the requiredreserve ratios to be maintained by banks. As the growth of pre-emptedresources was inadequate to meet the Government’s requirement, it had toperforce borrow funds from outside the captive market through postal savingsand provident funds, by offering substantial fiscal incentives and at administeredlow rates of interest. Thus, the economy was pushed into the throes of financialrepression.The logical question that follows is whether the experience of fiscaldominance over monetary policy would have been different if there had beenseparation of debt management from monetary management in India?  Or, werewe served better with both the functions residing in the Reserve Bank?  Whathas really happened is that there was a significant change in thinking regardingoverall economic policy during the early 1990s, arguing for a reduced direct roleof the Government in the economy. A conscious view emerged in favour of fiscalstabilisation and reduction of fiscal deficits aimed at eliminating the dominance offiscal policy over monetary policy through the prior practice of fiscal deficits beingfinanced by automatic monetization. It is this overall economic policytransformation that has provided greater autonomy to monetary policy making inthe 1990s.In pursuance of the financial sector reforms undertaken in 1991, despitethe proactive fiscal compression and efforts made by the RBI in moderatingmoney supply during the early part of the 1990s, the continuance of the ad hocTreasury bills implied that there could not be an immediate check on themonetized deficit. In order to check this unbridled automatic monetization offiscal deficits, the First Supplemental Agreement between the RBI and theGovernment of India on September 9, 1994 set out a system of limits for creationof ad hoc Treasury bills during the three-year period ending March 1997. Inpursuance of the Second Supplemental Agreement between the RBI and theGovernment of India on March 6, 1997, the ad hoc Treasury bills werecompletely phased out by converting the outstanding amount into specialundated securities and were replaced by a system of Way and Means Advances.The participation by the RBI in primary auctions of the Government has alsobeen discontinued with effect from April 1, 2006 under the provisions of FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBM). Other relatedmeasures that have been initiated since 1991 are deregulation of interest ratesand lowering of statutory ratios.The Indian economy has made considerable progress in developing itsfinancial markets, especially the government securities market since 1991.Furthermore, fiscal dominance in monetary policy formulation has significantlyreduced in recent years. With the onset of a fiscal consolidation process,withdrawal of the RBI from the primary market of Government securities andexpected legislative changes permitting a reduction in the statutory minimumStatutory Liquidity Ratio, fiscal dominance would be further diluted.All of these changes took place despite the continuation of debtmanagement by the Reserve Bank. Thus, one can argue that effectiveseparation of monetary policy from debt management is more a consequence ofoverall economic policy thinking rather than adherence to a particular view oninstitutional arrangements.The core issue of the conflict of interest between monetary policy andpublic debt management lies in the fact that while the objective of minimizingmarket borrowing cost for the Government generates pressures for keepinginterest rates low, compulsions of monetary policy amidst rising inflationexpectations may necessitate a tighter monetary policy stance. Therefore, theargument in favor of separating debt management from monetary policy rests onthe availability of effective autonomy of the central bank, so that it is able toconduct a completely independent monetary policy even in the face of anexpansionary fiscal stance of the government.But is this a realistic possibility?  If there is an understanding amongstpolicy makers that expansionary fiscal policy that is financed by monetizationleads to undesirable results would such a policy be pursued?  The Indianexperience has itself shown that as such realisation took place in the 1990s thepolicy response was to arrive at policy conventions between the Governmentand the Reserve Bank that enabled the practice of independent monetary policy,despite debt management continuing to be housed in the RBI.In theory, separation between the two functions would perhaps enhancethe efficiency in monetary policy formulation and debt management, but thedebate in the Indian context needs to recognize certain key dynamics of thefiscal-monetary nexus. First, in India, the joint policy initiatives by theGovernment and the RBI have facilitated good co-ordination between public debtmanagement and monetary policy formulation. Wheres commitment to fiscaldiscipline and reduction in monetized deficit have imparted considerableautonomy to the operation of monetary policy, the proactive debt managementby the RBI also facilitated the conduct of monetary policy, especially through theuse of indirect instruments. In fact, the substantial stock of Governmentsecurities held by the RBI enabled it to sterilize the monetary impact of capitalflows through open market operations since the late 1990s.  In recent years, withthe reversal in the interest rate cycle, the RBI was able to prescribe higher riskweights on assets to protect the balance sheet of the banks. This step certainlyensured financial stability for the economy. Second, the RBI’s experience inmanaging public debt over the years has equipped it with the requisite technicalcapacity of efficiently fulfilling the twin responsibilities of debt and monetarymanagement in tune with requirements of the Government and marketconditions. The RBI has been making efforts to develop the money andgovernment securities market since 1988 and has gained valuable experienceand knowledge about related markets. This may have been difficult toaccomplish if the debt management function had been effectively separate.Third, in the next five years, significant changes are slated to unfold in the Indianfiscal system: operationalisation of the recommendations of the Twelfth FinanceCommission, whereby the Centre ceases to operate as an intermediary formobilizing resources for States with the latter having to raise funds directly fromthe market; the RBI’s withdrawal from the primary market of Government paperfrom April 1, 2006 has implications for the management of interest rateexpectations; and implementation of the proposed amendment to the BankingRegulation Act permitting flexibility to the RBI for lowering the Statutory LiquidityRatio(SLR) below 25 per cent of net demand and time liabilities of banks wouldreduce the captive subscription to Government securities.With all of these changes taking place in the monetary fiscal environmentin the near future, there will be great need for a continued high degree ofcoordination in debt management between RBI and the Government.  In fact, inthe U.S., even though debt management is formally done by the Treasury, theclose co-operation that actually exists between the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York and the Treasury is not very different in function from the relationshipbetween the RBI and the Government in its debt management function.The evaluation of our experience therefore supports the position that apragmatic view needs to be taken on this issue keeping in mind the specificinstitutional context of a particular country in mind.Regulation and SupervisionNormally, there would be little discussion of regulation and supervision ofbanks in the context of the relationship between a central bank and theGovernment.  This issue arises in India because of the predominant Governmentownership of banks after nationalization of banks in 1969 and 1980.  By the1990s, more than 90 per cent of banking assets were in banks owned by theGovernment.  In this institutional setting there was a perception given that bankscannot fail and that depositors are effectively fully protected.Moreover, all management appointments in banks rested with theGovernment, and hence the norms of corporate governance in public sectorbanks.  Furthermore, in the presence of administered deposit and lending rates,credit allocation and other banking decisions that rested with the government,regulation and supervision of banks also effectively became subservient to theGovernment during the 1970s and 1980s.Once again, it was only after the change in banking policy in 1991,emphasizing competition along with interest rate deregulation and elimination ofcredit allocation, that banking regulation and supervision by the Reserve Bankcould become effective. It is the introduction of competition through the entry of new privatesector banks and expansion of foreign banks, along with the idea of equalregulatory treatment of private and public sector banks,  that has necessitatedthe practice of modern regulation and supervision.  The promotion of safety andsoundness of the banking system and protection of depositors have againbecome relevant.The primary justification for financial regulation and supervision byregulatory authorities is to prevent systemic risk, avoid financial crises, protectdepositors’ interest and reduce asymmetry of information between depositorsand financial institutions. The business of banking has a number of attributesthat have the potential to generate instability as banks are much more leveragedthan other firms due to their capacity to garner public deposits. Therefore, theneed for establishing an agency to regulate and supervise the banking activityarose from frequent bank failures in various countries with ramifications for thewhole economy. The central banks had started to focus their attention onensuring financial stability and avoiding a financial crisis, since the latenineteenth century. The experience of the Great Depression had a profoundeffect on banking regulation in several countries and commercial banks sincethen have progressively been brought under the regulation of central banks.The basic objective of bank supervision is to ensure that banks arefinancially sound, well managed and that they do not pose a threat to the interestof their depositors. The emphasis of supervision has been shifting in the recentperiod from the traditional Capital, Assets, Management, Earnings, Liquidity andInterest Rate Sensitivity (CAMELS) approach to a more risk-based approach.Basel II, which encompasses the risk analysis, uses a ‘three-pillar’ concept –minimum capital requirements, supervisory review and market discipline – toensure financial stability.Central banks have traditionally regulated and supervised financialinstitutions, including commercial banks. However, since central banks are alsoregulators and influence the behavior of market participants, supervisionconducted by central banks may pose a moral hazard problem. Therefore, theidea of a separate supervisory authority has gathered some momentum in recentyears. In addition, as a practicing central banker, I can envisage situations ofconflict between monetary policy, and regulation and supervision, especially insituations of economic and financial stress. To illustrate a case of conflict, themounting inflationary pressures in a country may require interest rates to risesharply but then banks would be potentially exposed to write-downs of theirasset valuations.The role of the RBI, in the changing environment, recognises thedifferences among various segments of the Indian banking system andaccommodates appropriate flexibility in the regulatory treatment. The changingrole of financial regulation and supervision of the RBI can be characterised byless accent on ‘micro’ regulation but more focus on ‘prudential’ supervision, andon risk assessment and containment. The Indian approach to banking sectorreforms has been gradual and different from many other emerging marketeconomies, where financial sector reforms resulted in privatization of erstwhilepublic sector financial intermediaries. As the commercial banks are scheduled tostart implementing Basel II with effect from end-March 2007, the RBI willcontinue to focus on supervisory capacity-building measures to identify the gapsand to assess as well as quantify the extent of additional capital, which mayhave to be maintained by such banks, due to operational and market risk.Finally, while recognizing the importance of consolidation, competition and riskmanagement to the future of banking, the RBI will continue to lay stress oncorporate governance, ownership pattern of private banks, expansion of foreignbanks and financial inclusion.Monetary PolicyThe operation of monetary policy in India before 1991 has to be analyzedin the context of nationalization of banks, the then prevalent financial repressionand the closed economy. The banks were nationalized to exercise social controlover their activities. In terms of outcome, nationalization succeeded in spreadingthe network of banks in rural areas and mobilizing private savings.  The savingsso mobilized were used for supporting public borrowing as well as for meetinghitherto neglected genuine credit needs in the rural areas.  This called forsignificant changes in the institutional arrangements, and more stringent controland supervision of the banking system. To accommodate the fiscal requirementsat low rates of interest, interest rates were administered and credit was directedin specific socially preferred sectors. The economy was closed, exchange rateswere fixed and exchange controls were strictly observed. In this situation ofnationalized banks, fiscal dominance and financial repression, operation of themonetary policy was severely constrained.  Monetary policy resumed itsoperational efficiency with increasing liberalization of the economy only after1991. Once again independence of monetary policy is more related to change inthe overall economic policy framework and not from a purist stance of separatingthe central bank from the government.As the financial system got liberalized up and monetary policy becamemore autonomous after the reversal of the previous mechanisms, thecorresponding development of the money market, Government securities marketand the foreign exchange market became necessary.  Appropriate monetarytransmission cannot take place without efficient price discovery of interest ratesand exchange rates in overall functioning financial markets.Earlier, various factors such as administered interest rates, directedcredit programmes, weak banking structure, lack of proper accounting and riskmanagement systems and lack of transparency in operations of major financialmarket participants had hindered market development. The RBI, like othercentral banks, has taken a keen interest in the development of financial markets,especially the money, government securities and forex markets in view of theircritical role in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.  The moneymarket is the focal point for intervention by the RBI to equilibrate short-termliquidity flows on account of its linkages with the foreign exchange market.Similarly, the government securities market has become important for the entiredebt market as it serves as a benchmark to price other debt market instruments.The RBI had been making efforts since 1986 to develop institutions andinfrastructure for these markets to facilitate price discovery. The consciousefforts by the RBI to develop efficient, stable and healthy financial marketsgained importance after 1991. The RBI followed a gradual and well-calibratedpolicy to facilitate the development of markets through institutional and financialinfrastructure development through improvements in market microstructure. Thepace of the reform was contingent upon putting in place appropriate systems andprocedures, technologies and market practices.There has been close co-ordination between the Central Governmentand the RBI, as also between different regulators, which helped in orderly andsmooth development of the financial markets in India. Following the reforms, themarkets have now grown in size, depth and activity paving the way for flexibleuse of indirect instruments by the RBI to pursue its objectives.  In the context ofthe integration of Indian financial markets, with global markets, the RBI has beenconstantly refining the operating procedures and instruments as also variousaspects of financial institutions, markets and financial infrastructure such as riskmanagement systems, income recognition and provisioning norms, disclosurenorms, accounting standards and insolvency in line with international bestpractices (Mohan, 2006).V. Autonomy of the Reserve Bank of IndiaThe trend towards central bank independence is not of recent origin. Inthe process of evolution, globally, while the spectrum of activities of the centralbanks has widened, the stance regarding the independence of central banks hastaken an interesting turn. Before the First World War, the central banks in mostcases were private institutions and were formally independent of theirgovernments. Interestingly, some central banks were established to serve asbanker and debt manager to the government. The position changed around theSecond World War - central banks in a number of countries (e.g., Germany,France, England, Japan, Italy and Sweden) were made subordinate to theirgovernments.  In recent years again, there has been a reversal in the trend.Governments have started granting more autonomy to their central banks: on theargument that a country is more likely to have low inflation if the central bank isindependent. This argument has its roots in the breakdown of gold standard inearly 1970s and the phase of high inflation that followed during the 1970s and1980s. To achieve price stability, increasingly, central banks were grantedautonomy along with an inflation target to meet, implying that independence wassaddled with accountability. To illustrate, the Bank of England, which hadsubstantial independence for much of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, butwas later made subservient to the government, was legally grantedindependence in June 1998 but with an inflation target to achieve. The recenttrend towards central bank independence has been influenced greatly by theexperience of the Bundes Bank and Reserve Bank of New Zealand.In the Indian context, central bank autonomy has to be examined in adifferent context. Initially, since the launch of the Five-year Plans, monetarypolicy was expected to accommodate the expansionary fiscal policy, as I havediscussed, to meet the requirements of the Government. Later, to meet socialobligations, the commercial banks were nationalized and statutory ratios raised,interest rates were administered, credit was rationed and channeled into prioritysector, exchange rate was fixed/managed, the economy was closed andmovement of foreign exchange was strictly controlled. In such an arrangement,there was no scope for autonomy of monetary policy. Since 1991, due toreforms, the situation has changed. The reforms have led to disinvestment inpublic sector banks, encouragement given to private sector banks, deregulationof interest rates, lowering of statutory ratios, cessation of automatic monetizationand implementation of current account convertibility. In recent years, short-termliquidity in the market is being managed successfully by the operation of aliquidity adjustment facility on a daily basis, while longer term liquidity has beenaddressed through traditional OMOs (Open Market Operations) in governmentsecurity auctions. As excess foreign exchange inflows intensified in 2003-2004,cooperation between the Reserve Bank and the Central Government resulted ina rare innovation designed to empower the RBI with new instruments forsterlisation. The government agreed to permit the RBI to issue additionalgovernment securities for sterlisation purposes upto a specified limit. ThusGovernment/RBI cooperation resulted in a new instrument that strengthened theReserve Bank in pursuing its monetary policy objectives.  Monetary policyoperation has also been constrained by the existence of minimum limits, on theCRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) of 3 per cent, and on the SLR of 25 per cent. In orderto provide greater monetary policy flexibility to the RBI the Government hasagreed to eliminate these minimum limits through introduction of amendments tothe relevant acts in Parliament.   Thus, monetary policy has moved from usingdirect instruments to market based indirect instruments, with the development ofthe money and government securities market. These developments since 1991indicate that the RBI already enjoys substantial autonomy in formulation ofmonetary policy.Inflation TargetingCentral banks are divided on the advisability of setting explicit inflationtargets.  Several central banks, such as, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, andthe Reserve Bank of New Zealand, have adopted explicit inflation targets.Others, whose credibility in fighting inflation is long established (e.g., theBundesbank (earlier) and the Swiss National Bank), do not set explicit annualinflation targets. However, concentrating only on numerical inflation objectivesmay reduce the flexibility of monetary policy, especially with respect to otherpolicy goals.High and sustained growth of the economy in conjunction with lowinflation is the central concern of monetary policy in India. The rate of inflationchosen as the policy objective has to be consistent with the desired rate ofoutput and employment growth. An inappropriate choice can lead to losses ofmacroeconomic welfare. Monetary authorities have to continually contend withthe short-run trade-off between growth and inflation. The problem iscompounded by the fact that the association between growth and inflation isnon-linear. At some low rates, inflation could operate in a manner that assists inbringing back unemployed resources into the economy and be beneficial or, atworst, neutral to growth. At higher levels, inflation is inimical to growth. There arealso very low levels of inflation that are associated with no growth or evendeflation. At what level should the policy choice of inflation be or what is thethreshold rate of inflation, if there is one, which is associated with the absence ofharmful effects of growth? There have been various studies that have attemptedto estimate threshold inflation rates. They suggest that the threshold inflation ratedepends upon a number of factors such as the structure of the economy, pastinflation history, the degree of indexation, and inflation expectations. Somestudies suggest that the threshold inflation for developed and developingcountries fall in the ranges of 1-3 per cent and 7-11 per cent, respectively. Anabiding problem with cross-country studies, however, is the risk of beinginfluenced by extreme values since samples include countries with inflation aslow as one per cent and as high as 200 per cent and even higher. Theestimation of such inflation threshold rates, therefore, needs to be done for eachcountry separately, in order to understand the behaviour of the economy inrelation to inflation.A major source of uncertainty in conducting monetary policy is the lack ofa clear understanding of the inflationary process as it has unfolded in recentyears. This has obscured a proper assessment of the nature of shocks impactingon the economy and the resulting risks to price stability. Variations in thetimeliness and reliability of inflation indicators, uncertainty surroundingunobservable indicators like potential output and gaps in the intrinsic knowledgeof the central banks about the state of the economy complicate the making ofmonetary policy. In countries like ours, there are other rigidities related toadministered prices, wage setting procedures, and weather induced supplyshocks that influence prices. Knowledge of the relationship between inflation andits determinants remains limited. Even if there were a consensus on a suitablemodel, considerable uncertainty would remain regarding the strength of thestructural relationships within the model. An even more fundamental problem isthat parameters may vary over time as a result of structural changes in theeconomy. This presumably explains why no central bank uses a formal model toderive its actual policies; for the foreseeable future, models will be an aid tojudgment rather than a substitute for judgment. The simple principle of inflationtargeting thus is also not so simple and, poses problems for monetary policymaking in developing countries.In India, we have not favoured the adoption of inflation targeting, whilekeeping the attainment of low inflation as a central objective of monetary policy,along with that of high and sustained growth that is so important for a developingeconomy. Apart from the legitimate concern regarding growth as a key objective,there are other factors that suggest that inflation targeting may not beappropriate for India. First, unlike many other developing countries we have hada record of moderate inflation, with double digit inflation being the exception, andlargely socially unacceptable.  Second, adoption of inflation targeting requiresthe existence of an efficient monetary transmission mechanism through theoperation of efficient financial markets and absence of interest rate distortions. InIndia, although the money market, government debt and forex market haveindeed developed in recent years, they still have some way to go, whereas thecorporate debt market is still to develop. Though interest rate deregulation haslargely been accomplished, some administered interest rates still persist. Third,inflationary pressures still often emanate from significant supply shocks relatedto the effect of the monsoon on agriculture, where monetary policy action mayhave little role. Finally, in an economy as large as that of India, with variousregional differences, and continued existence of market imperfections in factorand product markets between regions, the choice of a universally acceptablemeasure of inflation is also difficult.VI. The Way AheadThe RBI has, over the years transformed itself continuously functionallyand structurally in response to the changing needs of the economy andGovernment policies. Since 1991, a special period of reforms and change hasbeen ushered in the economy and the RBI has participated in this change veryactively. The RBI continues to pursue the development role but now with somedifference. In recent years, it has made consistent efforts to develop financialmarkets, build institutions and encourage use of technology in the financialsystem.The economy is passing through a new phase due to the enactment ofthe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill, encouraging participationof private and foreign banks, increasing globalisation and continued liberalisationof the capital account. The gross savings rate is nearly 30 per cent of GDP andthe economy is recording a growth rate of about 8 per cent annually, in recentyears. In this situation, a substantial increase in household financial savings isexpected as well as the need for higher credit disbursement in the economy. Theemphasis on financial inclusion will also lead to enhanced need for financialintermediation. The financial institutions would therefore have to prepare forhigher volume of transactions. In view of the expected increase in competition,banking institutions would need to integrate various services like banking, e-commerce, mutual funds, insurance, and money market operations.The new challenges facing the RBI are many. First, if the Indian bankingsystem is to attain international excellence, it will require action on several frontslike introduction of greater competition; convergence of activities and supervisionof financial conglomerates; induction of new technology; improvement in creditrisk appraisal; encouragement of financial innovation; improvement in internalcontrols and establishment of an appropriate legal framework. The role of theRBI in this context amounts to promoting safety and soundness while allowingthe banking system to compete and innovate. Second, as a central bank, theRBI would further need to develop the financial markets, especially the money,government securities and foreign exchange markets to enhance the efficiencyof the transmission mechanism, along with the corporate debt market. Third,price stability and financial stability would continue to be of concern withexpected increase in credit expansion and global integration. Fourth, concernsregarding social security, and investment of pension and insurance funds wouldneed to be addressed.I would like to finish on an optimistic note. As the RBI has successfullyfaced challenges in the past, it can be expected to continue to adapt to thechanging economic environment in future.
