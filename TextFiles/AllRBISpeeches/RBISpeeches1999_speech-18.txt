• •I am happy to be here with you at the first of a series of seminars being organisedby the Primary Dealers Association of India. In fact, this event is in fulfillment of one ofthe roles of the Primary Dealers Association, as a self-regulatory organisation, and asThe number of PDs were just six when I inaugurated the Primary DealersAssociation in March 1998 and the size of the family has more than doubled to thirteen inone year. Primary Dealers will have to play a significantly larger and more effective rolein the Government Securities market this year.  On our part, RBI will continue to offerfull support to PDs in our effort to further develop the financial markets. In fact, the RBIhas been facilitating the operation of PDs through a variety of measures and these areinvariably discussed with them.  The PDs have been in close coordination with the RBIon all matters of contemporary relevance in the Government Securities markets.  Wehave been soliciting their advice on various matters and their advice has providedvaluable inputs to us in fine-tuning some of the policies.  Currently, the Primary DealersAssociation is working closely with the Internal Debt Management Cell of the RBI insetting up the Electronic Dealing System.  I believe that this will be in place by JuneThe Primary Dealers’ presence in the Government Securities market has broughtabout an element of dynamism, both in the primary and secondary segments. Last yearwas a difficult year due to unprecedented international and domestic developments. Withcooperation from PDs as well as other market participants, we were able to complete theIn December 1998, I had spoken on the Development of Debt Markets in Indiaand, this was followed up with another lecture on the development of money market inIndia. The major policy developments were reviewed and a detailed agenda for furtheraction was drawn up.  The Agenda which included technology, regulatory and legalissues and the need for standardisation of practices in debt markets, also underlined theimperative need to generate a strong retail segment of the gilt market. An internal sub-Group of the Technical Advisory Committee on Government Securities Market was setup to look into the various aspects of the repo market. The sub-Group has since submittedits report which is currently being examined by us. Meanwhile, in the Union Budget for1999-2000, the Government has proposed to abolish stamp duty on transfer of debtinstruments within the depository mode. This is expected to improve the volume in repoof PSU bonds and corporate securities. There is also progress in the proposal to amend                                           • Inaugural address by Dr.Y.V.Reddy, Deputy Governor, RBI, at the Seminar on GovernmentSecurities Market, in Chennai, on April, 17, 1999.

I had narrated trends in both nominal and real interest rates in India andanalysed the five important reasons for pressure on real interest rates in India.  Six issueswere flagged of which Government borrowing programme was the first.  Market reformsrelating to Government securities market and money market were also listed.  In bothMy colleague, Mrs. Usha Thorat will speak in detail, on the GovernmentI would, therefore, speak on a sub-sect of the debt market, viz., I will briefly explain for record, the concept of securitisation and highlight theimportance of securitisation in terms of its benefits to the originator, investor and thefinancial system.  The process of securitisation will then be dealt with, of-course, tracingthe Indian experience in securitisation. The major legal and regulatory issues relevant arelisted. Finally, to help operationalising what has been debated so far, I will place beforeSecuritisation is a process through which illiquid assets are transferred into a moreliquid form of assets and distributed to a broad range of investors through capitalmarkets.  The lending institution’s assets are removed from its balance sheet and areinstead funded by investors through a negotiable financial instrument.  The security isSecuritisation as a technique gained popularity in the US in the 1970.  Favourabletax treatment, legislative enactments, establishment of Government-backed institutionsthat extend guarantees, and a pragmatic regulatory environment appear to havecontributed to the successful development of this market. The market for securitisation inthe US which is dominated by home mortgages has diversified to credit cards, homeUK is the second largest market for securitisation after the US.  Areas ofsecuritisation in the UK are broadly similar to the US and include residential mortgages,credit cards, consumer loans, commercial real estate and student loan.  The Bank ofEngland has played a leading role in evolving guidelines for banking and other authorisedinstitutions in its loan transfers and securitisation.

Experience of UK is ofOther countries in Europe have been relatively slow starters, though regulatoryand legislative changes in Germany, France, Belgium and Spain have been fashioned toassist development of securitisation. In Japan, the securitisation market is not welldeveloped since until recently, the Government had restricted securitisation to the assetsof leasing, consumer loan and credit card companies. The Government has, however,Securitisation is designed to offer a number of advantages to the seller, investorand debt markets.  For seller or originator, securitisation mainly results in receivablesbeing replaced by cash thereby improving the liquidity position. It removes the assetsfrom the balance sheet of the originator, thus liberating capital for other uses, andenabling restructuring of the balance sheet by reducing large exposures or sectoralconcentration. It facilitates better asset liability management by reducing market risksresulting from interest rate mismatches. The process also enables the issuer to recycleassets more frequently and thereby improve earning.  Finally, transparency may beFor investor, securitisation essentially provides an avenue for relatively risk-freeinvestment. The credit enhancement provides an opportunity to investors to acquire goodIt also provides opportunity for matching cash flows and managing ALM since asecuritised instrument carries regular monthly cash flows and has varying maturities. TheFrom the point of view of the financial system as a whole, securitisation increasesthe number of debt instruments in the market, and provides additional liquidity in themarket. It also facilitates unbundling, better allocation and management of project risks.It could widen the market by attracting new players on account of superior quality assetsNow, a word of caution. Benefits are possible but there are views that thesecuritisation process, if not carried out prudentially, can leave risks with the originatingbank without allocating capital to back them. While all banking activity entailsoperational and legal risks, these may be greater, the more complex the activity.  It is feltthat the main risk a bank may face in a securitisation scheme arises if a true sale has notbeen achieved and the selling bank is forced to recognise some or all of the losses if theassets subsequently cease to perform.  Also, funding risks and constraints on liquiditymay arise if assets designed to be securitised have been originated, but because ofdisturbances in the market, the securities cannot be placed.  There is also a view that there3being available.prevalence of secondary markets would offer liquidity.quality assets and to diversify their portfolios.improved since securitisation results in identifiable assets in the balance sheet.Features of Securitisationamended laws to allow full-scale securitisaton as recently as in May 1997.special relevance to India, and we should liberally draw on it.is at least a potential conflict of interest if a bank originates, sells, services andFor the uninitiated, let me briefly narrate the process. The proces s begins whenthe lender (or originator) segregates loans/lease/receivables into pools which arerelatively homogenous in regard to types of credit, maturity and interest rate risk.  Thepools of assets are then transferred to a Special Purpose Vehicle ( SPV) usuallyconstituted as a trust.  The originator may float the SPV as a subsidiary in the form of alimited company.  Another option could be for the SPV to be floated jointly by theoriginator/individuals/banks/institutions who are interested in the securitisation deal.Based on these, the SPV issues asset backed securities in the form of debt, certificates ofbeneficial ownership and other instruments.  The securities issued may be with or withoutrecourse.  Interest and principal payments on the loans, leases and receivables in theunderlying pool of assets are collected by the servicer (who could also be the originator)and transmitted to the investors. Credit enhancement can add features to boost investorconfidence.  This could be in the form of a provision of recourse, a guarantee requiringcollateralisation.There could be three basic methods of transfer of assets, viz., assignment and sub-participation. Novation is the clearest way of selling a loan andeffectively transferring both the rights and obligations. In novation, the existing loanbetween originator and borrower is cancelled and a new agreement between the investorand borrower is substituted.  The buyer steps into the shoes of the original lender or sellerwho ceases to have any obligations to the borrower.  The loan, is therefore, excludedAn assignment transfers from the seller to buyer, all rights to principal andinterest.  Assignments for the purpose of disposing of assets may fall into two basic legalcategories.  The first is statutory assignment, transferring both legal and beneficial title.A statutory assignment will pass and transfer from the seller to the buyer all the legalrights to principal and interest.  In most cases, it will also pass on all the legal remediesavailable against the borrower to ensure discharge of debt.   In other words, the buyeracquires the full legal and beneficial interest in the loan. The second is equitableassignment, transferring only beneficial title. It does not transfer legal rights.  Thus, abuyer may not be able to proceed directly against a borrower.  The seller must be joinedSub-participation does not transfer any of the seller’s rights, remedies orobligations against the borrower to the buyer.  But, it is an entirely separate, back-to-back, non-recourse funding arrangement, under which the buyer places funds with theseller.  In return, the seller passes on to the buyer, payments under the underlying loan,Securitisation in India4novation,which the borrower makes to him.  But, the loan itself is not transferred.in action.

Assets to the tune of Rs.1 ,200 crore is in the process ofbeing bought over.  CRISIL is reported to have rated about Rs. 1,200 crore of securitisedunrated transactions.The first widely reported securitisation deal in India dates back to 1990 whenCitibank securitised auto loans and placed a paper with GIC mutual fund.  Since then, avariety of deals have been undertaken.  Asset classes chosen have concentrated mostly onauto and hire purchase receivables of NBFCs.  According to some estimates, 35 per centof all securitisation deals between 1992 and 1998 related to hire purchase receivables ofApart from these, some innovative deals have also been struck. Earlier, in 1994-SBI Cap structured an innovative deal where a pool of future cash flows of high valuecustomers of Rajasthan State Industrial and Development Corporation was securitised.An oil monetisation deal has been structured where the future flows of oil receivablesaccruing to a company was securitised.  Real estate developers have securitisedreceivables arising out of installment sales. The recent securitisation deal of Larsen &Toubro has opened a new vista for financing power projects.  The deal was asecuritisation of lease receivables even before the plant was completed.  Thus, thisNational Housing Bank ( NHB) has made efforts to structure the pilot issue ofmortgage backed securities ( MBS) within the existing legal, fiscal and regulatoryframework.

NHB will act as anissuer of pass through certificates ( PTCs) and as a trustee on behalf of the investors.There is a view that there will be a conflict of interest if NHB, a regulator also acts as atrustee.

In addition, there have been several  securitised debt. The market is unregulated and lacks transparency in terms of volume, price, parties to  Legal and Regulatory Issues in SecuritisationA number of factors, mainly legal and regulatory, appear to have to be addressedThe first relates to stamp duty. Under statutory assignment, securitisation involvestransfer of mortgaged debt, which can be effected only by means of an instrument inwriting.  Every instrument by which property, whether movable or immovable istransferred attracts  valorem stamp duty.  Typically, the rate of stamp duty ranges from0.5 per cent to as high as 4 to 8 per cent of the value of transaction.  Thus, the process ofsecuritisation becomes too expensive. Recently, there has been significant relief sincestamp duty has been reduced to 0.1 per cent in some States.  This is so, in Maharashtra inrespect of transfer of movables; in Tamil Nadu in respect of transfer of housingloans/security created; and in Gujarat and Karnataka in respect of movables andimmovables.Second, under the Registration Act, 1908 transfer requires compulsoryThird, the Transfer of Property Act, according to some legal views, has held thatassignment of a debt should be in whole and not a part assignment.  Further, both theTransfer of Property Act and the Sale of Goods Act hold that only a property currently inexistence is capable of being transferred.  The laws impede development of securitisationin future receivables as transfer of future property does not fall under the definition ofFourth, s ome provisions of the Income Taxt Act, 1961 are reported to have animpact on securitisation.  For instance, Section 60 of the Act, contemplates transfer ofincome without transfer of assets which are the source of the income.  In such a case, theincome so transferred is chargeable to income tax as the income of the transferor and isincluded in his total income.  Similarly, there are other sections in the Act which inhibitFifth, the existing set of foreclosure laws are said to increase the risks of mortgagebacked securities by making it difficult to transfer property in cases of default.

However, in terms of the existingregulatory framework, only companies holding/accepting public deposits are subject toprudential norms and are also required to comply with SLR requirements as a percentageof their public deposits.  Thus, SPVs, which are non-deposit taking NBFCs would not besubject to prudential norms prescribed by RBI on capital adequacy and credit exposureWhether the Pass Through Certificates ( PTCs) issued by the SPV would beconsidered as public deposits under RBI’s NBFC Directions depends upon the class ofsubscribers to the instruments issued by the NBFCs.  If the PTCs are issued to a categoryof subscribers, who are in the exempted category, then these Certificates are not betreated as public deposits. The exempted category of investors include Government,NBFCs, banks and financial institutions.Another important aspect relates to whether NBFC directions apply if only thebeneficial interest on the assets is transferred to SPV issuing the Certificates. As perRBI’s regulations, the nature of assets for securing the deposits raised is not the criteriafor the applicability of the Directions.  However, the definition of public deposits doesnot include debentures/bonds, which are fully secured by the assets owned by thecompany in respect of which a charge has been created in favour of the trustees for suchDevelopment of the market for securitisation in India will need efforts of theCentral Government, State Governments, RBI and SEBI. I had briefly alluded to some ofthe legal and regulatory issues. The provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, StampAct, Registration Act and the Income Tax Act may have to be examined in detail in orderto facilitate securitisation in a cost effective manner.  Legislative amendment to variousActs is a time consuming process.  Some of the issues, particularly the external legalenvironment affecting banks and financial institutions are receiving the attention of theExpert Group set up by the Government under the Chairmanship of Shri T.R.Andhyarujina. In the meantime, it may be useful to identify issues of a short-term naturewhich could be tackled on a priority basis.  An in-house Group has been set up in the RBIto identify these issues and the action points and I want to make it clear that whatever I7Regulatory Frameworksay here is without prejudice to the freedom of the Group to give its recommendations.Legal FrameworkNext Stepsdebenture/bond holders.statutory authorities, companies including norms, although registration is mandatory.Special Purpose Vehicle as a CompanyCurrently, there is no comprehensive regulatory framework forsecuritisation, understandably so, since it is of recent origin even in developed countries.SPV can be formed as a company under the Companies Act, 1956 or as a Trust under theIndian Trusts Act, 1882. Hence, SPV formed as a company will have to be registered asan NBFC under the RBI Act and is subject to RBI’s regulatory framework. Secondly,such an NBFC will also come under the regulations of Companies Act. Thirdly, SPVformed as a Trust will come under the purview of the Indian Trusts Act. Fourthly, to theextent banks and financial institutions are involved in securitisation, they will continue tofall under RBI regulations.
