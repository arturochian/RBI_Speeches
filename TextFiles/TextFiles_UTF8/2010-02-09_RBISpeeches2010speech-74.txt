? The Global Financial Crisis: Genesis, Impact and Lessons   Deepak Mohanty    Respected Dr. Reddy, Prof. T.N.Srinivasan, Prof. S. D. Tendulkar, Prof.  T. Krishnakumar, distinguished invitees and friends. I thank the C.R.Rao  Advanced Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Sciences and the  University of Hyderabad for giving this opportunity to share my thoughts on the  global financial crisis. I am humbled speaking on this subject in the presence of  Dr. Reddy, the distinguished former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India,  who is widely credited for having put in place prudential policies which  shielded India from the worst effects of the global financial crisis.      The world economy today seems to be recovering from the most severe  crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. As you know, it surfaced in the  subprime mortgage sector in the US in August 2007 and took the character of a  global crisis in September 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  It  is also dubbed as the greatest crisis in the history of financial capitalism because  of the way it simultaneously propagated to other countries.    The impact of the crisis can be gauged from the sharp upward revisions to  the estimates of possible write-downs by banks and other financial institutions  from about US$ 500 billion in March 2008 to about US$ 3.5 trillion in October  2009. More than the financial cost, the adverse impact on the real economy has  been severe: in 2009, the world GDP is estimated by the IMF to have contracted  by 0.8 per cent and the world trade volume is estimated to have declined by 12  per cent.                                                     ?  Speech by Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India in Hyderabad on December 30, 2009  at the International Conference on Frontiers of Interface between Statistics and Science organized in honour of   Prof. C.R.Rao on the occasion of his 90th birthday by the  C.

Bhoi is acknowledged.     1 The expanse of the crisis has tested all the limits of conventional and  unconventional policy options available to policymakers around the world. In  fact, the speed and intensity with which the US subprime crisis turned into a  global financial crisis and then into a global economic crisis has led to a whole  new debate on dominant tenets in macroeconomics. It has challenged the  conventional views on the self-correcting nature of financial markets. The  debate on the role of finance in economic growth has again come to the centre  stage.    Against this backdrop, I will reflect on the following set of questions.   How similar or different is the recent crisis from the past crises in terms of its  cause and manifestation?  How did policies in different countries respond to the  crisis?  How and why was India impacted and how did we respond? What are  the key lessons from the crisis? I will conclude with a focus on India.    I. Genesis of the Crisis    The crisis was an outcome of the interplay between both macroeconomic  and microeconomic factors. From a macroeconomic perspective, the crisis has  been attributed to the persistence of global imbalances, excessively  accommodative monetary policy pursued in major advanced economies and  lack of recognition of asset prices in policy formulation. From a microeconomic  perspective, the crisis has been attributed to the rapid financial innovations  without adequate regulation, credit boom and the lowering of credit standards,  inadequate corporate governance and inappropriate incentive system in the  financial sector and overall lax oversight of the financial system.       2 Global Imbalances   It is argued that while the subprime problem was the trigger, the root  cause of the crisis lies in the persistence of the global imbalances since the start  of the current decade (BIS, 2009). Large current account deficits in the  advanced countries mirrored by large current account surpluses in the emerging  market economies (EMEs) implied that excess saving flowed uphill from  developing countries to developed countries (Chart 1 and Table 1). Bernanke  (2005) considered this saving glut as one of the factors leading to the crisis.  Among the advanced countries, it is the US which has a large saving-investment  gap. Among the EMEs, it is China, which has the largest saving surplus. The  causation, however, is not very clear: whether it is excess saving in China or  excess consumption in the US that contributed to the crisis.          3 Table 1: Savings and Investment  (As a percentage of GDP)  Savings Investment Saving-Investment  Gap  Countries 2001200820012008 20012008 1 2345 67 Advanced Economies 20.4 19.5 20.9 21.0 -0.5 -1.5 Of which     United States 16.5 12.6 19.3 18.2 -2.8 -5.6    Japan 26.9 26.6 24.8 23.5 2.1 3.1    Germany 19.5 25.6 19.5 19.2 0.0 6.4    United Kingdom 15.4 15.3 17.4 17.0 -2.0 -1.7    Euro area 21.2 21.4 21.1 22.2 0.1 -0.8 Emerging and Developing Economies 25.0 34.8 24.4 30.9 0.6 3.9 Of which     Developing Asia  31.5 47.7 30.1 41.9 1.4 5.8        China  38.4 49.2 36.3 42.6 2.1 6.6        India  23.5 32.5 22.8 34.9 0.7 -2.4 Middle East  29.7 41.9 23.4 22.8 6.3 19.1 Commonwealth of Independent States  28.8 30.9 21.8 26.2 7.0 4.7 Note: Data for China is from the World Development Indicators Online Database, World Bank; data for India is from  the national source (CSO).

Apart from the saving-investment imbalances, there has been concurrent  accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves by the EMEs, particularly  China, also as self insurance against sudden reversal of capital flows (Table 2).  It is argued that accumulation of reserves, particularly from trade surplus,  resulted in misalignment of exchange rates. This prevented the global  imbalances to adjust.  Moreover, the burden of adjustment was borne  disproportionately by countries with flexible currencies.  While there is merit in  this argument, it is not clear whether movement in exchange rates by itself  could have prevented global imbalances without an adjustment in aggregate  demand  lower consumption in the US and higher consumption in China.    4 Table 2 : Foreign Exchange Reserves    Emerging and Developing Economies   (US$ billion) Countries 2001 2008 1 2 3 Emerging and Developing Economies 857 4,963 Of which  Developing Asia 380 2,538        China 216 1,950        India 46 248 Middle East 135 826 Commonwealth of Independent States 44 504       Russia 33 413 Western Hemisphere 159 498      Brazil 36 193      Mexico 45 95   Source: WEO, October 2009, IMF.    Monetary Policy   In a number of advanced countries, policy rates remained below what  could be considered as neutral rates.  Monetary policies in the US and Japan  were too easy for too long (Truman, 2009). The US federal funds rate was  lowered to 1 per cent by June 2003 while the Bank of Japans discount rate  reached 0.1 per cent by September 2001. Subsequently, though policy rates  were raised, they have been brought down again to their lowest levels following  the crisis (Chart 2).    5   Many critics argue that the current low levels of policy rates may well be  sowing the seeds for the next crisis.  Notwithstanding the arguments on both the  sides, one aspect is clear that monetary policy in advanced countries has  spillover effect on the EMEs.  Monetary Policy is generally conducted with the  domestic objectives in view but the international spillover effects are not  inconsequential.  For example, increase in interest rate differential could  engender excessive capital flows from developed countries to developing  countries with an increasing risk of reversal unrelated to the fundamentals of the  capital recipient countries. This can accentuate asset prices, put upward pressure  on exchange rate, and could have destabilizing effects.     Excess Leverage  A comparison of the current crisis with various episodes of past crises  reveals considerable similarity with regard to the underlying causes  excessive  use of credit, lowering of credit standards, and heavy reliance on leverage.  Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) find that the global dimension of the current crisis  is neither new nor unique to this episode.      6 Apart from perpetuating global imbalances, the easy monetary policy  pursued in advanced economies encouraged excessive leveraging on the part of  investors as well as banks and financial institutions. The sharp rise in the  leverage of financial institutions in the first decade of this century has been  particularly striking (Chart 3).     Source: Global Financial Stability Report, April 2009, IMF.    Search for Yields   The low levels of interest rates led to the search for yields. This  encouraged rapid financial innovations in terms of complex derivative  instruments and structured finance products created through the process of  securitization. Easy credit combined with under pricing of risks created  speculative asset bubbles, especially in real estate. However, domestic  macroeconomic policies in many cases could not take into account the build-up  of systemic risks in the financial system arising from leverage and asset price  bubbles, thereby contributing to the crisis.   7 The financial system also was enlarged with the growth in off-balance  sheet activities of banks through the process of originate-to-distribute model.  This shadow banking sector, however, remained beyond the pale of regulation.  Consequently, both the investors and regulators increasingly relied on the  assessment of rating agencies and independent auditors, who are supposed to  provide a third-party evaluation of the risks embedded in various financial  transactions. However, due to the existing flaws in the financial system and  distorted incentive structures, the rating agencies issued unrealistically high  ratings to new issuances, thereby contributing to the build-up of systemic risks.   The crisis shows that the systemic risks posed by the immensely complex  financial system were masked by the benign macroeconomic outcomes  characterized as the great moderation. This prolonged period of high output  growth and low inflation was essentially attributed to free markets and  successful globalisation. During the golden years, financial economists believed  that free-market economies could never go astray which is belied by the crisis  (Krugman, 2009). The financial system, however, remained vulnerable to the  risks of reversal in easy monetary policy on the one hand and disorderly  unwinding of global imbalances on the other. It is argued that the great  moderation carried the seeds of its own destruction. This stability bred  complacency, excessive risk taking and, ultimately, instability (Minsky, 2008).  Furthermore, multilateral institutions like the IMF which were charged with the  responsibility of surveillance, failed in diagnosing the vulnerabilities both at the  global level and at the level of systemically important advanced economies  (Reddy, 2009).  II. Manifestation of the Crisis   Interbank markets in advanced economies were the first to be affected by  severe liquidity crisis as banks became reluctant to lend to each other on fear of   8 counterparty risks. This was manifested in abnormal level of spreads, shortening  of maturities, and contraction, or even closure, of some market segments (Table  3).  Table 3: Movement in Interbank (3-month LIBOR-OIS) Spreads  (Basis points) Indicator Pre-Crisis LIBOR-OIS End- End- End-March peak level March December  2007 2009 2009 1 234 5 US  8 361 99 9 Euro area 6 199 82 27 Japan  16 80 49 18 UK 11244120 17   Source: GFSR, April and October 2009, IMF and Bloomberg.    Transmission to the Real Sector   With money markets witnessing a squeeze, equity prices plummeting and  credit spreads rising, banks and other financial institutions experienced erosion  in their access to funding and capital. The tightening of credit conditions  combined with deleveraging and risk aversion by banks and financial  institutions led to a sharp slowdown in private sector credit growth, particularly  in the advanced economies, which worked as a channel for transmitting the  crisis from financial institutions to the real economy (Chart 4). At the same  time, the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions affected profitability.   Consequently, the liquidity problem transformed into a solvency problem  leading to bank failures in the US and other advanced economies in Europe. The  attendant wealth loss on account of collapsing asset prices further accentuated  the problem in the real sector.      9 Chart 4: Select Financial Market Indicators        Source: Global Financial Stability Report, IMF.    Transmission to EMEs   The crisis spread to the EMEs through all the three broad channels   confidence, finance and trade  reflecting increased global integration. The  confidence channel worked in two ways. First, although the epicenter of crisis   10 was in advanced markets, exposures to emerging markets were reduced sharply  with the return of risk aversion. Second, with increase in deleveraging, there  was a widespread shortage of US dollar. Consequently, reversal of capital flows  led to equity market losses and currency depreciations (Table 4). The slump in  export demand and tighter trade credit caused deceleration in aggregate demand.  The banking system in the EMEs, however, showed relative resilience during  the crisis because of their limited exposure to the toxic assets as also improved  regulation and supervision in the aftermath of the East Asian crisis.

The resolution mechanisms that came to the fore had to contend  with new and complex web of the financial world involving credit default swaps   11 (CDS), special investment vehicles (SIVs) and credit ratings. Monetary  authorities in the advanced economies were the first to resort to an aggressive  monetary easing first by reducing policy rates and then by using their balance  sheets in unconventional ways to augment liquidity.    The large scale economic downturn accompanying the financial crisis  also led to activation of counter-cyclical fiscal policy of unprecedented  magnitudes. The fiscal measures focused on improving the balance sheet of the  financial and corporate sectors as reflected in large scale bailouts in the US and  other advanced economies.   The EMEs also undertook various policy measures to limit the adverse  impact of contagion and their policy responses became more coordinated with  global efforts. A distinguishing feature, however, is that while for the advanced  countries the policy priorities were to restore normalcy and strengthen financial  regulation and supervision, dealing with the reversal of capital flows and  collapse of trade occupied the policy attention in the EMEs. Notwithstanding  such differences, restoring growth emerged as the overriding objective among  both the set of countries. It was for the first time that EMEs turned out to be  active partners in finding meaningful resolution mechanisms to a global  problem.   III. Impact and Policy Responses in India  Why was India Impacted?   In the initial phase of the crisis, the impact on the Indian financial  markets was rather muted as the direct exposure of banks to subprime assets  was negligible. Nonetheless, India could not remain unscathed for long. As the  crisis intensified in the aftermath of collapse of Lehman Brothers, the global  shocks first impacted the domestic financial markets and then transmitted to the   12 real economy through the finance, trade and confidence channels. This could be  attributed to the global nature of the current crisis on the one hand and  accelerated trade and financial integration of the Indian economy with the world  since the 1990s. Consequently, there has been a shift in the degree of  synchronisation of the Indian trade and business cycles with the global cycles,  which along with increased financial integration in the recent period indicate  that India cannot remain immune to global trends. Thus, global economic  developments now have a greater influence on the domestic economy  (Mohanty, 2009).   How was India Impacted?     Post-Lehman, the impact of the global financial crisis was first felt through  reversal of capital flows and fall in equity prices in the domestic stock markets  on the back of large scale sell-off by the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) as  a part of the global deleveraging process. Simultaneously, there was reduced  access to external sources of funding by Indian entities due to the tightening of  credit conditions in international markets. This shortage of dollar liquidity put  significant pressures on the domestic foreign exchange market, which was  reflected in downward pressures on the Indian rupee along with its increased  volatility. Simultaneously, there was a substitution of overseas financing by  domestic financing, which brought both money market and credit market under  pressure.       The transmission of this external demand shocks was swift and severe  on Indias export growth, which turned negative in October 2008. Imports too  started declining by December 2008 as domestic activity slowed. The overall  impact was reflected in a fall in investment demand and sharp deceleration in  the growth of Indian economy in the second half of 2008-09 which persisted  through the first quarter of 2009-10.    13 Policy Response     In order to limit the adverse impact of the contagion on the Indian  financial markets and the broader economy, the Reserve Bank, like most other  central banks, took a number of conventional and unconventional measures.  These included augmenting domestic and foreign exchange liquidity and sharp  reduction in the policy rates. The Reserve Bank used multiple instruments such  as the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), open market operations (OMO), cash  reserve ratio (CRR) and securities under the market stabilization scheme (MSS)  to augment the liquidity in the system. In a span of seven months between  October 2008 and April 2009, there was unprecedented policy activism. For  example: (i) the repo rate was reduced by 425 basis points to 4.75 per cent, (ii)  the reverse repo rate was reduced by 275 basis points to 3.25 per cent, (iii) the  CRR was reduced by a cumulative 400 basis points to 5.0 per cent, and (iv) the  actual/potential provision of primary liquidity was of the order of Rs. 5.6 trillion  (10.5 per cent of GDP). These measures were effective in ensuring speedy  restoration of orderly conditions in the financial markets over a short time span.  These measures were supported by fiscal stimulus packages during 2008-09 in  the form of tax cuts, investment in infrastructure and increased expenditure on  government consumption. The expansionary fiscal stance continues during  2009-10 to support aggregate demand. While the magnitude of the crisis was  global in nature, the policy responses were adapted to domestic growth outlook,  inflation conditions and financial stability considerations.   Until the emergence of global crisis, the Indian economy passed through  a phase of high growth driven by domestic demand: growing domestic  investment financed mostly by domestic savings and sustained consumption  demand. This overall improvement in macroeconomic performance in India  could mainly be attributed to the sequential financial sector reforms that  resulted in an efficient system of financial intermediation, albeit bank-based;   14 the rule-based fiscal policy that reduced the public sectors drag on private  savings; and forward looking monetary policy that balanced the short-term  trade-off between growth and inflation.   IV. Lessons from the Crisis   The crisis has shown that irrespective of the degree of globalisation of a  country and the soundness of domestic policies, it can be impacted by a crisis in  any other economy due to the interlinkages in the global economy. With the  benefit of hindsight, a number of important issues have emerged which allows  us to draw lessons. I will highlight four key lessons.    First, the policy objectives of central banks would have to be broader than  price stability as conventionally defined. The lesson for central banks that  emerged from the crisis is that financial stability can be jeopardised even if  there is price stability and macroeconomic stability (Subbarao, 2009).   Moreover, the success in stabilising goods and services prices may not preclude  inflation in asset prices, causing unsustainable speculation leading to asset  booms.  Thus, apart from price stability, the central banks would have to take  into account asset prices and focus on financial stability as an explicit objective  of policy.  While there is more of an agreement to recognise financial stability  as an objective, there is less of an agreement about the instrumentalities for  achieving this objective.  There is a broader acceptance of macroprudential tools  for asset prices. It is, however, not apparent at this stage as to what extent policy  interest rates could be used to address asset price inflation.  Second, there is a need for fiscal consolidation to generate the fiscal  space for macro management.  During the crisis, fiscal policy responses have  been unprecedented, although they were conditioned by country-specific  factors. But the massive fiscal support, though appropriate as a crisis response,  has raised questions about debt sustainability. This is reflected in increase in   15 sovereign CDS spreads even for advanced countries which has implications for  macro-financial stability going forward. It is, therefore, important that fiscal  buffers are established in good times to provide the necessary fiscal space for  counter-cyclical fiscal measures in bad times.  Third, financial institutions would have to be less leveraged and better  regulated. This financial crisis brought into sharp focus the interlinkages among  the financial institutions, markets and the payment and settlement systems. It  has shown that market self regulation has limits. Hence, all systemically  important financial institutions, markets and instruments should be subject to an  appropriate degree of regulation and oversight depending on their relative  importance for overall financial stability. At the same time, it needs to be  recognised that regulation in itself can act to magnify cycles. In order to address  the issue of pro-cyclicality, regulators need to focus on: identifying factors that  amplify cycles; improving and diversifying market risk management models;  undertaking more rigorous stress testing; and adopt forward-looking procedures  to capital calculations.  Fourth, the international financial architecture needs to be strengthened to  st address the challenges of the global economy of the 21 century.  The crisis has  exposed fundamental problems, not only in national regulatory systems  affecting finance, competition and corporate governance, but also in the  international institutions and arrangements created to ensure financial and  economic stability.  The IMF, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the G-20  should provide the effective platform for addressing global issues in a more  credible manner. The IMF would have to play a more active role in crisis  prevention, management and resolution. It needs to strengthen its multilateral  surveillance with a greater macro-financial focus. In this context, the G-20  emphasis on modernizing the IMFs governance process is a welcome step  which should improve its credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness. The G-20   16 can provide the necessary political support for implementation of policies which  need a coordinated effort at the global level.  V. Conclusions    India was relatively less impacted by the crisis despite increased global  integration of the Indian economy in recent years. This could be attributed  mainly to the structure of the economy, cautious policies, prudent regulation  and effective supervision.   First, Indias economic growth is largely domestic driven  high  investment financed by high domestic saving.   Second, de-regulation and opening up of the economy was sequenced  appropriately. Along with the opening up of the economy, the financial markets  were also developed to improve efficiency in financial intermediation.  Third, the Reserve Bank also being the regulator and supervisor of the  financial system, information related to financial system always flowed to the  central bank, which helped in fine tuning the monetary policy. In fact, financial  stability as a monetary policy objective in India emerged much before the  unraveling of the current crisis.   Fourth, the multiple indicator approach to the conduct of monetary policy  in India helped in identifying credit market excesses and undertaking counter- cyclical monetary policy measures in a pre-emptive manner.    Fifth, monetary policy was well supported by macroprudential measures  to ensure that it does not impinge on financial stability. Pro-cyclical measures in  respect of capital and provisioning were tried in 2005, much before the crisis.   Sixth, in view of systemic implications of non-banks, they have been  brought within the regulatory framework in terms of prescriptions of capital   17 adequacy and exposure norms. Banks exposures to these entities are subject to  prudential regulations.  Seventh, the liquidity risks are contained by restricting the overnight  unsecured market to banks and primary dealers (PDs), with prudential limits.  The requirement of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) for banks acts as a buffer for  both liquidity and solvency of banks.     Although cautious macroeconomic policies coupled with macroprudential  regulations helped limit the adverse impact on the Indian economy, there is no  room for complacency. As highlighted by Governor Dr. Subbarao, there are  lessons from the crisis for India too, which include: (i) further strengthening  regulation at the systemic and institutional levels; (ii) making our supervision  more effective and value adding; and (iii) improving our skills in risk  management. India has been an active participant at the global discussions, the  task for us will be to reflect our point of view in the global debate and adapt the  global policies and guidelines to the Indian situation on a dynamic basis.  Furthermore, we need to actively pursue the challenge of financial inclusion.   The functioning of global economy in the past three decades suggests that  the process of financial development and globalisation is susceptible to crisis.  Nevertheless, the recurrence of financial crisis has not changed the positive  relation between financial development and growth (Lipsky, 2009). As the  current crisis shows, the problems in finance and financial regulation need to be  addressed at a national as well as global level to ensure that the benefits of  financial developments become more widespread and enduring in nature. Thus,  what is needed is not more regulation but sharper regulation of the financial  system to ensure sustained financial development with stability.          18 Select References  th 1.
