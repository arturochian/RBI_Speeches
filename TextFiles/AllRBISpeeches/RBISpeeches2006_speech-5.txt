Monetary and Financial Policy Responses to Global Imbalances*Rakesh MohanI would like to compliment Bank Indonesia for arranging this conference onthe theme “Monetary and Financial Policy Responses to Global Imbalances” at theAnnual International Seminar 2006. This is an issue that has been among the topconcerns of central bankers in the last few years: so the opportunity to have thisdiscussion at this opportune time is very welcome for all of us.The issue of large global imbalances has been debated at length since thebeginning of this decade, both at international fora and also in regional conferencesand seminars. In India, we have regularly highlighted this issue in our Annual Reportsand Annual Policy Statements. Dr Y V Reddy, the Governor of the Reserve Bank ofIndia has also addressed these issues in two of his recent speeches.It is pertinent to note that whereas the existence of global imbalances is wellrecognised, there are still no definite answers on its possible impact and what policyresponses need to be considered. Therefore, seminars of this kind assume importancein exploring the implications of global imbalances for Emerging Market Economies(EMEs) and developed countries alike.In my talk today, I will first give a brief introduction to the concept of globalimbalances, while highlighting some of the recent global initiatives that have beenundertaken to correct these imbalances. This will be followed by discussion of theefforts that are further required in this direction. Thereafter, I would present the Indianperspective on global imbalances against the backdrop of the strength and resilienceof the Indian economy exhibited in the recent years.I. Global Imbalances: Concept and Contributing Factors ConceptConceptually, from a single country perspective, imbalances arise when theeconomy exhibits, on a sustained basis, large current account deficits or surplusesthat are essentially external manifestations of large domestic saving-investment gaps                                                * Paper presented by Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the BankIndonesia Annual International Seminar, November 16-17, 2006.

From a global perspective, however, the balance ofpayments identity, in principle, should ensure that high surpluses in some countriesare matched by deficits in other countries. Thus, the emergence of a large surplus ordeficit in one country’s external account implies the mirror image elsewhere. Hence,the global concerns are not about the existence of current account deficits orsurpluses per se, but the persistence of large deficits and surpluses, particularly inlarge and systemically important economies.In reality, global imbalances in the international economic system today refersto the large and increasing current account deficits (CAD) of the US andcorrespondingly large surpluses in other regions, particularly in Asia. The extent ofthese imbalances has become large, particularly in the aftermath of the Asian crisisand has generated issues of unsustainability of such global imbalances and chances ofdisorderly adjustment hampering the global economy, in general.  The Contributing Factors(i) Twin Deficits in the United StatesThe current global imbalance is largely attributed to the large and increasingCAD of the US that has been financed by surpluses elsewhere, especially in emergingAsia, oil exporters and Japan. The US has been experiencing a current account deficitin each year since 1982. The US deficit remained below 3 per cent of GDP till themid-1990s. Since then, however, it has risen substantially. The period following thebursting of the information technology bubble in the US was marked by highlyaccommodative monetary policy along with expansionary fiscal policies. On the onehand, the decline in the rate of interest led to the housing boom and increase inhousing and other asset prices while, on the other hand, fiscal stimulation led toincrease in consumption. While real activity in the US did provide a stimulus toactivity in the rest of the world, it has been accompanied by large and growing twindeficits -fiscal as well as current account deficits. In absolute terms, the CAD of theUS has seen a seven fold increase from US $ 114 billion in 1995 to US $ 791 billionin 2005. As a percentage of GDP, the CAD of the US almost doubled itself every 5years since the early 1990s. During 2005, the CAD to GDP ratio was close to 6.4 percent of GDP, the highest ever CAD for the US (Table 1).2Table 1: Macro Parameters of the United States(in per cent, annual average)Period GDP growth CAD/ General Government Savings –InvestmentFiscal Balance/GDP gap / GDPGDP(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)1981-85 3.3 -1.3 -2.9 -1.61986-90 3.3 -2.4 -2.4 -2.21991-95 2.5 -1.1 -3.1 -0.91996-2000 4.1 -2.6 -0.2 -2.22001-2005 2.4 -5.0 -3.5 -3.9Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce             World Bank on-line database             World Economic Outlook, IMF, various issuesIt is widely agreed that wealth effects arising from increasing asset prices,particularly of housing, have also contributed significantly to lower savings rates andhigher consumption rates in the U.S. The large current account and fiscal imbalancesin the US also find its reflection in the savings-investment mismatches that have risensubstantially in the present decade. The private net savings in the US has declinedfrom 8 per cent of GDP in the 1980s to less than 2 per cent in 2005.(ii) Surpluses in the Emerging economiesContrary to the US that has fed the domestic demand, in Asia and otheremerging economies, growth since the late 1990s has been led by external demand.The current account has recorded large surpluses since 1999, particularly for Chinaand other East Asian emerging market economies (EMEs) (Indonesia, Malaysia,Taiwan, Thailand). Surpluses of two island economies viz. Hong Kong andSingapore have also increased significantly. India too registered current accountsurpluses between 2001 and 2004, albeit small.In the post Asian crisis period the savings rate in most East Asian EMEs,which has generally remained higher than the industrialized countries exhibited amodest decline. Investment rates, however, showed sharp declines resulting in the1widening of the savings investment gap in the EMEs (Table 2). India, however,remains an exception to this trend, and still continues to have a negative savingsinvestment gap.                                                1 According to Barro and Lee (2003), the East Asian Crisis has exerted permanent depressing effects oninvestment in these economies.  There has been an investment drought rather than a savings glut.3Table 2: Savings-Investment Gap in Emerging Economies(as % to GDP, annual average)Country 1981-85 1986-90 1991-95 1996-2000 2001-05(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)China -0.1 -0.4 1.5 3.2 2.4*Hong Kong 3.9 9.8 3.2 1.1 8.6India -2.2 -1.5 -0.4 -1.4 -1.3*Indonesia 2.0 1.5 1.5 5.5 6.7Korea -1.7 4.1 -1.1 3.7 2.6*Malaysia -2.7 7.6 -1.6 13.9 19.7*Singapore -2.9 4.6 11.8 16.4 23.6Thailand -4.4 -1.8 -5.3 6.4 4.5Note : * Average for four years  2001-04Source: World Bank online database.(iii) Surpluses in oil exporting countriesThe large current account surplus of the oil exporting countries has alsoemerged as a new source contributing to the global imbalances. The Middle Eastregion recorded current account surpluses of 18.5 per cent of GDP in 2005. Oilrevenues in the Middle East region have risen further in the first half of 2006 becauseof both higher prices and some expansion in production. The surplus for 2006 isprojected by the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook (WEO,September 2006) to rise further to 23 per cent of GDP (almost US $ 280 billion).Higher net savings by oil exporters are also believed to have contributed towards thesoftening of global interest rates and consequent boost to demand in economies withmarket based financial systems such as the US. The depth of US financial marketstogether with rapid innovation of new products for effective risk management havemade US an attractive destination for global investors’ funds. Any correction ofglobal imbalances on this account depends on what oil producers do with theirsurging oil revenues in terms of their domestic absorption.II. Move towards CorrectionCurrently, there is an emerging consensus that US consumers cannot continueto support worldwide demand indefinitely and Asian EMEs and oil exportingcountries cannot continue financing these perpetually. Yet there are differing viewson the process of correction, its nature, pace and consequences. In this context, theInternational Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) Communique, April 22,2006 reiterates "Any action for orderly medium-term resolution of global imbalancesis a shared responsibility, and will bring greater benefit to members and theinternational community than actions taken individually." Key elements of an orderly4global rebalancing which are generally advocated include increase in US savings,structural reforms in the Euro area and Japan and exchange rate flexibility in EMEs.Some developments observed in the recent months may contribute towardscorrecting global imbalances in future.  These are set out below.First, in the US, the fiscal deficit has come down to 2.0 per cent of GDP in thesecond quarter of 2006 mainly because of revenue buoyancy. Federal tax revenueshave remained buoyant in 2005 and 2006 so far and expenditure discipline has beenmaintained, suggesting that the federal budget deficit in fiscal 2006 is likely tooutperform initial budget estimates and fall modestly to 2.25 per cent of GDP (IMF,2006c). The US fed funds rate has risen to reach 5.25 per cent. The U.S dollar in therecent period has depreciated marginally against some other major currencies.Second, higher investment witnessed in some Asian emerging economies maycontribute towards correcting imbalances. China has recently exhibited a very rapidinvestment growth, though concerns have been raised about the possibility of aninvestment boom-burst cycle (World Economic Outlook, September 2006). In thefirst three quarters of 2006, the total investment in fixed assets in China has been 27.3per cent higher than that in the same period last year.  As has been advocatedrepeatedly by the Chinese policy makers, the need now is for Chinese consumption toincrease faster than their investment growth.Third, increased exchange rate flexibility has been observed in some of theAsian countries. The US dollar has seen some depreciation while the non-UScurrencies have appreciated. During 2005 currencies in many developing countrieshave also appreciated steadily against the US dollar accompanied by some movementtowards more flexible exchange rate policies. This is noticed most notably in China,which has revalued its currency against the dollar by around 2.1 per cent. Malayasiahas also taken similar steps. During 2006, there were significant changes in theexchange rate of Euro/US dollar (from US $ 0.84 per Euro in early 2006 to US $ 0.78per Euro by September 2006), yet there has been little significant impact in US Eurotrade patterns. In view of this, the efficacy of the exchange rate as an equilibratingmechanism needs to be investigated. For industrial countries, the exchange rate pass-through to consumer price inflation has been found to have almost halved in the1990s compared to the pre-1990s period (Gagnon and Ihrig, 2001). Furthermore, thepass-through has reportedly declined more in developing countries in the 1990s thanin the advanced economies (Frankel, Parsley and Wei, 2004). Financial innovationssuch as the availability of hedging products have also lowered the degree of pass-through by enabling exporters and importers to ignore temporary shocks and setstable product prices despite large currency fluctuations. Besides, studies have alsoshown that within EMEs, the impact of exchange rate movements on trade balancesvaries significantly depending upon whether they are predominant exporters ofmanufactures, non-oil commodities or oil (Allen, 2006).5The increasing share of non-tradables in GDP has also worked towardscontaining the exchange rate pass through. Non-tradables generally approximated byservices have increased their share in all major industrial countries as also in Chinaand India. As populations age, demand moves more in favour of services than forgoods. Thus, the aging population in industrial countries has provided much of thegrowth impetus for services. With the shift in demand composition in favour ofservices, the extent of exchange rate pass-through, which works primarily throughtradables has been limited. The role of exchange rate movements or policy inducedadjustments in influencing behaviour of economic agents through the domestic pricemechanism appears to have been significantly truncated. If exchange rate depreciation(appreciation) does not appreciably increase (decrease) domestic prices of importedgoods, there would be little reason to expect a reduction (increase) in demand forimported products. Hence small exchange rate changes can scarcely be expected tohelp significantly in effecting changes in the current account (Mohan, 2005).Thus, the following issues assume importance• Will the recent developments see some domestic correction in the US,leading to a decline in its CAD?• Are there chances of investment increasing in the Asian countries andwhether this would reduce their surplus?• Can exchange rate adjustments contribute significantly towards correctingcurrent account imbalances?Further EffortsNotwithstanding the progress that has been made towards correctingimbalances, further efforts are desirable—with every country doing its part—to helpreduce medium-term risks associated with the imbalances.The US will have to try to curb household and government borrowings andstrengthen national savings, without hurting recovery and excessive dollardepreciation. The focus of fiscal consolidation in the US has to remain on theexpenditure side, though revenue measures aimed at broadening the revenue base andtax system with greater emphasis on consumption tax rather than income tax cannotbe ruled out (WEO, September 2006). With the housing market slowing down in theUS, some increase in private savings is expected. This will be further helped by policyinitiatives such as introduction of health savings accounts that would raise incentivesfor household savings and passing of pension legislation.The Euro area needs to pursue structural reforms, especially product andlabour market policies, to boost domestic demand and broad base the recovery. Japanhas started recovering finally. Its current account surplus has begun to narrow downfrom 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2005 and the trend iscontinuing in 2006 with domestic demand strengthening. It is widely agreed that6Japan should further strengthen its financial system and carry out other structuredreforms to provide further flexibility in the economy.Further flexibility in exchange rate policies is desirable for the emergingmarket economies. Any attempt by EMEs to intervene excessively and sterilize theirforex reserves to maintain their competitiveness will further delay the adjustmentprocess. However, as indicated earlier that unless there are substantial changes inexchange rates, it seems that one cannot expect corrections to global imbalances.Studies have shown that with unchanged growth rates in the US and the rest of theworld, the US dollar would need to depreciate by nearly 33 per cent - equivalently,the non-US currencies would have to appreciate, on average, by 50 per cent - tobalance the US trade account (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2004, 2005). Another study haspointed out that dollar should depreciate by 30 per cent in real terms to bring USCAD within 2 per cent (Mussa, 2004).Promoting efficient absorption of higher oil revenues in oil-exportingcountries with strong macroeconomic policies should also be a key element of thiscorrection mechanism. It is suggested that these countries could boost expenditures tosome extent in areas where social returns are high like education, health,infrastructure and social security. Given economic interlinkages, all countries andregions will have a role to play by increasing the flexibility of their economies andadapting to changing global demand patterns.Let me quote our own Mid-term Review of the Annual Policy Statementannounced on October 31, 2006,"Global imbalances have continued to widen during 2006. With some centralbanks actively reassessing their stance now, the potential drainage of globalliquidity would test the resilience of world financial markets and weigh uponthe outlook on the global economy. It is in this context that the IMF’sprojection of the U.S. current account deficit at about 7 per cent of GDP in2007 with large surpluses continuing in Japan, emerging Asia and oil-exporting countries is disturbing. The sharp rise in the net foreign liabilityposition of the US raises the risks of abrupt and disorderly adjustment ofmajor currencies as the global imbalances unwind. However, there is aninteresting lull in the serious concerns expressed both by policy makers andfinancial markets in regard to the global imbalances, possibly on theassumption that universal recognition of the problem would per se lead toharmonised actions that would avoid hard landing."7III. The Indian SettingIn recent years, the Indian economy has seen a massive transformation from aclosed, controlled, slow growing economy to a more open, liberalised and one of thefastest growing economies of the world. Economic reforms in India since July 1991have accelerated growth, enhanced stability and strengthened both external andfinancial sectors. India has remained an attractive destination for foreign investors.Despite high capital flows, India has been successful in managing liquidity. India’sforeign exchange reserves are in excess of the total outstanding external debt of thecountry. The trade as well as financial sector is considerably integrated with theglobal economy. Even during difficult times i.e. the East Asian crisis, the Russiancrisis during 1997-98 and post-Pokhran sanctions, Indian economy has shownsubstantial resilience in withstanding the contagion.Since the 1970s, India's current account has exhibited surplus only on sixoccasions (Table 3). The deficit has been modest and has remained below 2 per centof GDP in most years. Only in 1990-91 on the brink of a balance of payments (BoP)crisis, the CAD to GDP ratio had marginally crossed the 3 per cent mark. Thus, in somany years, India has had a balanced external account that has also been reflected inthe corresponding savings-investment gap.In the recent period i.e. 2001-02 to 2003-04, India experienced a surplus in thecurrent account though the magnitude was small and it was essentially theconsequence of business cycle slow down in early part of the decade along withcorporate restructuring. With a turn around in business cycle, investment picked up in2004-05 and India moved back to a current account deficit scenario. The currentaccount deficit further widened during 2005-06 reflecting the cumulative impact ofthe high level of international crude oil prices and growth in imports emanating fromstrong industrial activity. The sustained rise in its invisibles surplus during 2005-06emanating from the buoyant software exports, remittances and various professionaland business services continued to moderate the impact of a growing merchandisetrade deficit. According to current projections, during the 11th Plan period (2007-08to 2011-12), current account is projected to remain in deficit and the normal andstable capital flows are expected to finance the deficit comfortably.8Table 3: Range of India's Current Account Balance since 1970-71Range of Current account Frequencybalance / GDP(1) (2)Current account surplus 6     equal to 1 per cent 2     between 1 to 2 per cent 4Current account deficit 30     between (-)1 to 0 per cent 15     between (-)2 to (-)1 per cent 11     between (-)3 to (-)2 per cent 3     between (-)3 to (-)4 per cent 1(in 1990-91 when CAD was 3.1 per cent)Source: Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, RBIUnlike in many of the Asian EMEs where current account surpluses havemainly contributed towards greater accumulation of reserves in these economies, inIndia reserve accumulation has been mainly due to large capital flows and the currentaccount surplus had only a minimal role to play in this regard, for a few years. Thus,it is clear that India, as such, has not contributed towards enhancing globalimbalances.India's macro policy has clearly laid a lot of stress on maintaining financialstability. The Indian economy as a whole and the financial sector in particular is nowmore resilient and in a better position to absorb financial shocks. This resilience hasbeen achieved by improving the macroeconomic fundamentals and regulatoryframeworks. Besides, unlike some EMEs that have seen demand to be predominantlydriven externally, the Indian economy is mostly domestic demand driven. WhileIndia’s exports constituted 11.5 per cent of GDP, its share in world trade is only 0.8per cent. Second, India's export basket is fairly diversified (Reddy, 2005).  Hence, itsexposure to volatility in growth patterns across the world is limited than most EMEs.Higher GDP growth in India during last three years has also seen a rise in savingsrate from 23.5 per cent in 2000-01 to 29.1 per cent in 2004-05. A significant turnaround in public sector savings has been a major cause for the increase in domesticsavings. Given the reform initiatives envisaged under the Fiscal Responsibility andBudget Management (FRBM) Act, public savings are expected to improve further.Besides, households in India are the major contributors to savings and given thefavourable Indian demographics over the next 20 years, the savings rate in India isexpected to remain high. This is in sharp contrast to other East Asian countries aswell as in the US, where major contributor to savings are the corporates that largelydepend on the cyclical path of the economy.9IV. Possible Impact of Global Imbalances on IndiaFiscalIndia continues to have a high fiscal deficit by international standards thoughit has declined significantly in recent years. In order to achieve sustainable fiscalcorrection and consolidation, both the central and state governments have adoptedfiscal responsibility legislations i.e., Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management(FRBM) Acts. The combined fiscal deficit of the centre and states is budgeted tocome down to about 6.5 per cent by 2007 (Table 4). Even if it is assumed that thecentre and the states comply with their respective FRBMs, their combined fiscaldeficit would continue to remain above 6 per cent by 2009-10. Generally, one wouldpresume that India remains somewhat vulnerable to the impact of global imbalanceson this account. However, the Indian case is unique as the Government does notresort to external financing to finance domestic debt. This would help India in notbeing subject to the consequences of global imbalances.Table 4: Combined gross fiscal deficit of centre and states(average per annum, as per cent to GDP)Period / Year Combined deficit(1) (2)1980-81 to 1984-85 7.191985-86 to 1989-90 8.881990-91 to 1994-95 7.751995-96 to 1999-00 7.732000-01 to 2004-05 9.002005-06 RE 7.452006-07 BE 6.50RE: Revised Estimate, BE: Budget EstimateSource: Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, 2005-06, RBIIn addition, both Reserve Bank of India and Government of India haveundertaken various initiatives to develop the government securities market. Theearlier features of an administered market with automatic monetisation have beendone away with. The Indian G-sec market today is more broad based, characterisedby an efficient auction process, an active secondary market supported by an activePrimary Dealer system and electronic trading and settlement technology (Mohan,2006).The effect of global imbalances, however, could be indirect through a rise indomestic interest rates as a consequence of rise in international rates. There could be10an increase in the cost of borrowings of the Government. However, since most of theoutstanding debt is at fixed rates and not on floating rates, the rise in the borrowingcost will be incremental. This situation also provides greater headroom for a flexiblemonetary policy to adjust policy rates, as and when warranted, without any excessiveimpact on the fiscal deficit (Reddy, 2005).  Private corporate sectorPrivate corporate external borrowing has been liberalised substantially inIndia. The stock of private external debt rose from about US $ 5 billion at end March1996 to  US $ 15.6 billion at end-March 2001 and has further risen to US $ 32.4billion as at end-March 2006 (Table 5). Potentially, corporates are expected toborrow more in future and hence, could be susceptible to the consequences of globalimbalances. If there are sharp fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates onaccount of the adjustment process, corporates that have borrowed at variable rateswould be subject to both exchange rate and interest rate risk, depending on themagnitude and efficacy of the risk mitigation activities.  However, without fullcapital account convertibility in India, the Government and the Reserve Bank of Indiaadminister the overall incremental debt exposure and put ceilings on total externalcommercial borrowings. Besides, corporates in India are encouraged to hedge theirforeign exchange exposure.Table 5: Exposure to foreign capital of Private Corporates:External Debt of the Private corporate SectorYear in US $ billion as per cent to reserves(1) (2) (3)1991 --1996 5.0 23.02001 15.6 36.92006 32.4 21.4             --: NegligibleSource: India's External Debt: A Status Report, Ministry of Finance, Government of India.Financial IntermediariesIn India, exposure of the financial intermediaries to external debt is limitedand regulated. Their foreign currency borrowings have been subject to the prudentiallimit of 25 per cent of their Tier-I capital. These limits amounted to US $ 2.7 billionas of March 31, 2006. With a view to enabling banks to raise resources overseas, thelatest monetary policy announcement on October 31, 2006 has enhanced this limit to50 per cent of their Tier I capital, or US $ 10 million, whichever is higher. Foreign11currency borrowings by the banks beyond this ceiling are linked to their net worth,exclusively for the purpose of export finance. With a move towards fuller capitalaccount convertibility, banks are likely to access forex markets more, underscoringthe need for further enhancement of the risk management capabilities of the bankingsystem.Banks in India have been financing investment in assets, home loans andretail market as well as equities. Like in many EMEs, asset prices and the equitymarket have seen a rising trend in the recent past in India as well. Should there be anyreversal of capital flows, asset prices could potentially decline as did happen in May2006. The most significant impact on banks’ balance sheet, however, could be feltthrough their investment portfolio. Banks in India hold substantial investments inGovernment and other fixed income securities. To the extent a rise in internationalinterest rates impacts the domestic interest rates, it would entail marked-to-marketlosses on the investment portfolios (Reddy, 2006).To prevent any unforeseen eventualities, the Reserve Bank has beenconstantly monitoring the Banks’ exposure to risky assets and has put ceilings ontheir exposure to equity markets.  In addition to a capital to risk-weighted assets ratio(CRAR) for the sector of 12 per cent, specific steps have been taken to meet theinterest rate risk. Separate provision for capital against market risk has beenintroduced.Conduct of Monetary PolicyMore importantly, one needs to look at the impact on monetary policy. Asindicated in a speech that I made sometime back in Colombo (Mohan, 2004), in aglobalised world, it is difficult to formulate monetary policy independent ofinternational developments. Monetary policy has become more complex and centralbanks will have to take into account, among other issues, developments in the globaleconomic situation, the international inflationary situation, interest rate scenario,exchange rate movements and capital flows while formulating monetary policy.Besides, in developing countries like India considerations relating to maximisingoutput and employment weigh equally upon monetary authorities as price stability.As far as the impact of the adjustment policies on India's monetary policy isconcerned, any significant readjustment of the currencies and rise in interest ratescould affect global growth inturn affecting growth prospects of several emergingeconomies including India. The conduct of monetary policy will have to factor inthese downside risks to inflation and any kind of turbulence to financial markets dueto repricing of risks while maintaining the delicate balance in terms of growth vis-a-vis price stability. A key feature of Indian monetary policy formulation in recentyears has been to look at both domestic and global factors and to guard against12various risks as and when they evolve. The Indian economy now is more resilient andin a better position to absorb a financial shock.As indicated in our Mid-Term Review on Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07 announced on October 31, 2006,"Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments invarious sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment ofthe economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetarypolicy in the period ahead will be• To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that supportsexport and investment demand in the economy so as to enablecontinuation of the growth momentum while reinforcing price stabilitywith a view to anchoring inflation expectations.• To maintain the emphasis on macroeconomic and, in particular,financial stability.• To consider promptly all possible measures as appropriate to theevolving global and domestic situation.”Downside RisksNotwithstanding these positive aspects of the Indian economy, downside risksremain as indicated in the various monetary policy statements released by theReserve Bank of India.First, moderation of demand on account of high oil prices poses the biggestchallenge. The oil market remained highly volatile during 2005 and first half of 2006on account of geopolitical uncertainty and supply disturbances. The averageinternational oil prices increased from about US $ 25 per barrel in 2002 to US $ 54per barrel in 2005 and further to US $ 73 per barrel around mid-July 2006. Thoughoil prices have softened in the more recent period (US $ 61 per barrel duringSeptember 2006), they still continue to remain at high levels. The medium termoutlook also does not give much comfort, especially to the oil importing developingeconomies, in view of the continued geopolitical tensions in the middle-east andpossible disruptions in other major oil producing regions, along with the tight globaldemand supply scenario. Though pass through of the hike in international oil pricesto domestic consumers is limited in the Indian context because of Governmentpolicies, its impact on the trade deficit via increase in oil imports bill cannot be ruledout. This further worsens the global imbalances by creating higher surpluses in the oilexporting countries.13Second, as mentioned before, India has not directly contributed to the globalimbalances and has built in enough stabilizers to keep it insulted from theconsequences of global imbalances. Yet any disorderly unwinding of globalimbalances is likely to have global ramifications and may affect the Indian economyindirectly. The speed at which the US current account ultimately returns towardsbalance, the triggers that drive that adjustment, and the way in which the burden ofadjustment is allocated across the rest of the world have enormous implications forthe global exchange rates. Private corporates and financial intermediaries are boundto get exposed to exchange rate risks if these variables exhibit substantialfluctuations, though the impact might be less than other EMEs.Third, any reversal of global capital flows from emerging and developingeconomies in the case of realignment of interest rates and slow investment growth onaccount of higher interest rates with the tightening of monetary policy stance bymajor central banks remain the other downside risks.Fourth, domestic developments exhibit strength and resilence with somedown side risks. There is a pick-up in the momentum of growth which also appears tobe spreading across all constituent sectors of the economy. Domestic financialmarkets have exhibited stable and orderly conditions. In the external sector, there aresigns of abiding strength and the current account deficit has been well-managed sofar. On the other hand, there are indications of growing demand pressures andpotential risks from rapid credit growth and strains on credit quality. High levels ofmonetary expansion and the evolution of the liquidity situation will need to becontinuously monitored for any signs of risks to inflation. The elevated levels of assetprices also represent a risk to the outlook for macroeconomic and financial stability.In brief, at the current juncture, for policy purposes, the two major issues that exertconflicting pulls are exploration of signs of overheating firming up to warrant apolicy response, and, the impact of lagged effects of earlier policy action on theevolution of macroeconomic developments.V. Concluding ObservationsTo sum up, being a closed economy earlier India had remained relativelyinsulated from global developments and hence, had little experience in dealing withthem. During the last fifteen years, India has opened up considerably, whilesimultaneously reforming the financial sector, improving its fundamentals andcreating some built in measures to ensure financial stability. The overall approach hasgiven the Indian economy enough resilience to withstand some major global risks.Indian growth prospects remain bright in the future and any significant correction toglobal imbalances via abrupt and sharp changes in exchange rates and internationalinterest rates will be taken into account.1415ReferencesAllen, Mark (2006), "Exchange Rates and Trade Balance Adjustment in Emerging marketEconomies", IMF Staff Paper, October 2006.Barro, Robert and J.
