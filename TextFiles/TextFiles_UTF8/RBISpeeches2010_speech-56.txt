RBI-OECD Workshop on Financial Literacy at Bangalore on  March 22-23, 2010 :  Speech delivered by Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Honble FM  _________________________________________________________  Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Ambassador Richard A.  Boucher, Deputy Secretary General of the Organization for Economic Co-operation  and Development, ladies and gentlemen     2. It gives me great pleasure to be here to inaugurate this Workshop on  Delivering Financial Literacy being co-hosted by the RBI and the OECD.  I must  compliment the Reserve Bank of India for thinking of hosting such a learning event  as a key component of its ongoing Platinum Jubilee celebrations. After all,  financial literacy, and education, plays a crucial role in financial inclusion,  inclusive growth and sustainable prosperity as is also being increasingly recognised  and acknowledged globally.   My compliments to OECD for innovatively leading  the effort on financial inclusion in the developing world and for co-hosting this  very important workshop.    3. While the financial sector policies in India have long been driven by the  objective of increasing financial penetration and outreach, the goal of universal  inclusion has eluded us. The network of co-operative banks to provide credit to  agriculture and saving facilities to the people living in rural areas, the  nationalization of banks in 1969, the creation of an elaborate framework of priority  sector lending with mandated targets were elements of a state and central bank-led  strategy to meet the savings and credit needs of large sections of the Indian  population who had no access to institutional finance.     4. This strategy for expanding the outreach of the financial system had relied  primarily on expanding branching, setting up newer institutions like the Regional  Rural banks and setting targets for credit to broad categories of the financially  excluded.  Without doubt, it has had a huge impact and altered many a life,  especially in the countryside. Given the sheer enormity of the challenge, however,  the outcomes of these efforts have so far been mixed.    5. What we need today, therefore, are new approaches to financial inclusion  that build on the lessons of the past but also involve, as the sub-theme of this  Workshop sugggests, trying out newer approaches and instruments. Importantly,  this also requires a change in the mindset on the part of policymakers, practitioners  and other stakeholders alike to figure out and put in place effective ways of  reaching out to the hitherto un-reached and under-reached segments of our  population.    6. Any policy initiative or effort seeking to afford greater access to financial  services to a large segment of the population necessarily involves the associated  issue of bridging the existing knowledge gap in financial education and literacy.  Over the last decade or so, researchers all over the world, especially in the  developed countries, have, therefore, started to study and explore whether  individuals are well-equipped to make financial decisions. Although the focus of  such research undertaken in various countries has varied widely in terms of both  the concerns and the context, it may be worthwhile to look back at some of these  efforts.     7. Financial literacy has also been linked to saving behaviour and portfolio  choice, often connecting financial knowledge to one specific type of transaction.  For example, the financially less literate are found to be less likely to plan for  retirement, to accumulate wealth, and to make wise investment decisions. In fact,  the recent global financial crisis has raised the question whether individuals lack  of financial knowledge led them to take out adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) or  incur credit card debt they could not afford.    8. Research and existing literature in financial literacy have thus typically  related individuals knowledge of economics and finance with their financial  decisions related to savings, borrowing decisions, retirement planning, or portfolio  choice. It has been said, particularly in the context of the developed economies, that  while the young do not save enough and do not fully understand the need for  investments for future, many of the elderly tend to feel the pinch of poverty. Today,  financial competence has become more essential as financial markets offer more  complex choices and, while the policies need to enable access, the responsibility  for saving and investing for the future primarily lies with the individuals.     9. Viewed in this background, financial education and literacy assumes  urgency in any given scenario. No wonder policymakers all over are increasingly  taking note of this and directing their efforts to address it.     10. In this context, I must mention and compliment the OECD for taking a pro- active initiative in generating awareness about financial education. Sometime ago,  it had done a major international study on financial education titled 'Improving  Financial Literacy' encompassing practical guidelines on good practices in financial  education and awareness. These guidelines promote the role of all the main  stakeholders in financial education: governments, financial institutions, employers,  trade unions and consumer groups. In addition, they also draw a clear distinction  between public information provided by the government and regulatory authorities,  on the one hand, and that supplied by the financial analysts, on the other.    11. In a country like India, there is, of course, an obvious case for promoting  financial education at the more basic level, especially in the context of the  development policies and programmes initiated to reduce vulnerability and expand  opportunities for the poor and financially excluded. In our country, financial  education and literacy, could ideally supplement our broader initiatives for efficient   2 and inclusive transmission mechanisms and the case for exploring the potential for  integrating financial education and literacy into our overall endeavour for financial  inclusion cannot be overstated.      12. While India has no nationwide structured financial education programme  either at school level or, in general, but institution-specific initiatives by Reserve  Bank of India, various Self Regulatory Organizations, Indian Banks Association,  commercial banks, Banking Code and Standards Board of India, and more recently,  by the Securities & Exchange Board of India, etc. seek to fill the gaps in financial  literacy and education.     13. I am extremely happy to learn that the Reserve Bank of India has initiated a  "Project Financial Literacy" with the objective of disseminating information  regarding the central bank and general banking concepts to various target groups.  One important instrument in this is the RBI website which is available in 13  languages. The Financial Education web site link offers basics of banking,  finance and central banking for children of all ages. In a series of comic book  initiatives, the Reserve Bank has sought to simplify the complexities of banking,  finance and central banking, with the goal of making the learning fun and  interesting. RBI has also enjoined upon all the banks to set up credible financial  literacy and credit counseling function in their frontline branches.      14. Indeed, financial education and literacy can broadly be defined as the  capacity to have familiarity with, and understanding of, financial market products,  especially rewards and risks in order to make informed choices. Viewed from this  standpoint, financial literacy primarily relates to personal financial education to  enable individuals to take effective actions to improve overall well-being and avoid  distress in matters that are financial. As any attempt at expanding the outreach of  financial education needs to start at the grass-roots, the initiative that RBI is  launching in collaboration with the State Government here for school children in  Karnataka is most welcome and promising indeed.        15. As I had recalled a while ago, pursuant to the process of globalization and  initiation of financial sector reforms here in 1991, the economic and financial  landscape in India has undergone a significant transformation. In the process, the  economy has become more diversified with new drivers and sources of growth. In  tandem with these changes, we have also seen the modernization of the financial  sector that has also become increasingly more diversified to meet the new  requirements of the economy.     16. The financial sector has also increasingly leveraged on advances in  technology which has significantly changed the way financial business is being  conducted. As developments in financial markets make possible a much wider  range of financial products and services, consumers, on the one hand, face   3 multifaceted choices and options in the management of their personal finances and,  on the other, get exposed to a gamut of risks.       17. At the same time, the advances in information technology, especially the  phenomenal growth in access to, and use of Internet, have lowered the costs of  information acquisition and processing as also of searching for a job. This, in turn,  has significantly raised job mobility with attendant implications for family size and  expenditure patterns. In this altered social and economic landscape, having  financial planning capacity has almost become mandatory as only such knowledge  and awareness empowers families to meet their near-term obligations and  maximize their longer-term financial well-being.    18. Taking you back to the country context in development strategy that I had  referred to earlier, as most of you may be aware India has a divergent, multi-lingual  framework. The regional profile in our country is diversified, with most people  across different regions being typically conversant in their vernacular languages.  Moreover, there exists a wide divergence in literacy levels across various States.  Within a State also, there are marked differences between rural and urban areas and  there is also a perceptible variation in the penetration of banking across regions.     19. Taken together, these unique circumstances in our country pose a  particularly crucial and challenging role for the public policy institutions, including  both the Govt. and RBI, to design appropriate delivery mechanisms for financial  literacy and education duly nuancing the regional differences.     20. Idioms and metaphors of development economics keep on changing from  time to time. Today, new financial sector initiatives in a country like ours - be it in  the form of prompt and innovative policy responses from the govt. and the central  bank or be it in the form of implementation efficiency and inventiveness from the  varied players - need to explicitly prioritize both financial inclusion and financial  education and literacy. I am sure this Workshop will throw up illuminating ideas  and fresh insights and provide a platform for sharing replicable cross-country  success stories, experiences and strategies in the area of financial literacy and  education.   21. With these words, I now have the pleasure of inaugurating this Workshop.  My best wishes for the success of this workshop and also for your individual and  collective efforts in promoting financial literacy.    Thank You   4
