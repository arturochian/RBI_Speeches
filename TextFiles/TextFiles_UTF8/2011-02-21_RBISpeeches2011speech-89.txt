Approach to Capital Account Management - Shifting Contours  1 Shyamala Gopinath  1. Thank you for inviting me to this forum once again and that too in these sublime  environs. Only in such sublimity could the deeply spiritual concept of Gross  National Happiness have been crystallised into a national policy mission. The theory  of Gross National Happiness (GNH) established by His Majesty the King of Bhutan  in 1972, defines Bhutans development objective as improvement in the happiness  and satisfaction of the people rather than growth of Gross National Product (GNP).  Included in GNH is a middle path approach in which spiritual and material pursuits  are balanced. I can only hope that after a deep, long standing relationship with Bhutan  over the last several years, we are able to incorporate at least the spirit of this  approach in our economic policies.  2. I have been a inaugural speaker at the FEDAI conferences during past few years, in  person or in absentia and it is always a challenge to select an appropriate topic in line  with the overall theme of the conference. I felt really relieved that the theme for this  Conference attempts to capture a broader canvas, revolving around long-run growth  cycles. I hope the deliberations enable us to focus more closely on the relationship  between the cart and the horse so that foreign exchange flows do support growth.   3. There are several ways in which capital flows and growth are related. First, growth  expectations drive capital flows. In turn, capital flows accelerate growth. If capital  flows are well absorbed by the real economy and do not generate macro-economic or  financial instabilities, they stay. Such capital flows augment growth over the long-run  and may help income levels in developing economies converge towards the income  levels in advanced economies. Second, capital is likely to be attracted towards  countries with high productivity growth and higher marginal productivity of capital.  However, in practice this is found to be not necessarily true. Third, what is generally  missed is the fact that it is not just the net capital flows that drive growth, but also the  gross capital flows contribute to growth. Gross capital flows contribute immensely to  diffusion of technology and international knowledge flows. Fourth growth   1 Keynote Address at the Annual Conference of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association  of India (FEDAI) on February 18, 2011 at Thimpu 1 augmentation can also take place because capital flows enforce macro-economic  discipline and force firms to improve governance. However, the impact of capital  flows on growth ultimately depends on their being stable and less volatile. Durable  capital flows bring durable growth, while non-durable and volatile capital flows not  only bring about non-durable growth but also large output losses in cases of currency  or banking crisis. This however does not make a case for capital controls as in a  globalised world capital account liberalisation is seen as a plus-sum game.   4. According to IMF's World Economic Outlook (October 2010), private financial flows  to EMEs are projected to increase to USD 339.6 billion in 2010 as compared to US  234.8 billion in 2009 accounted for mainly by equity flows. Growth in bank lending,  after the rebound since the crisis lows, is expected to slow down. Going further,  however, the improved growth scenario in developed markets (DM) and the rising  concerns regarding inflation in the EMs has created uncertainty in regard to the  quantum of flows to EMEs. Global imbalances, which have been the driver of capital  flows over the past several years, are expected to continue.   5. Given the inherent uncertainties, most of the capital recipient EMEs are going to find  it challenging to respond dynamically. If the tide of global flows changes, it may not  be easy to change policy gears swiftly though magnitude of impact would depend on  the specific macroeconomic situation, particularly the current account position. Over a  longer horizon, therefore, it makes sense to have a broad framework for capital  account management from a macroprudential perspective.   6. It is this post-crisis shift in regard to the approach to capital account that I intend to  talk about today. Beyond the immediate impact of capital flows on exchange rate  dynamics, the procyclicality of such flows and implications for financial stability are  being clearly recognised. In this context, the underlining theme that I want to bring  out is that irrespective of the stage of liberalisation of capital account, there seems to  be an imperative need for a framework for capital account management which gives  the policymakers sufficient space and instruments to be able to modulate policy to the  different characteristics of capital flows. Not having such a framework only enhances  the disruptive impact of sudden capital control measures when they are announced.     2 Shift in the approach to capital account management    7. The recent crisis has clearly been a turning point in the world view on capital controls.  The issue of regulation of capital flows has slowly but steadily moved to the  centrestage from earlier being confined to the periphery of the mainstream policy  discourse. The hesitancy of policymakers at the helm in discussing this openly earlier  has given way to a welcome openness.    8. Even the Bretton Woods institutions have revisited their earlier approach on the issue  of management of capital flows. There was a time in the nineties that, backed by the  intellectual force of the Washington Consensus, the IMF at one point was  considering including liberalization of international capital movements as a central  purpose of the Fund. The subsequent crisis in East Asia in 1997, however, halted such  moves of the IMF.   9. It seems to have come full circle now. The experience of many EMEs during the crisis  underlined the financial stability implications of volatile capital flows. At the G-20  Seoul Summit in Nov 2010, the Leaders agreed to work on financial stability issues  that are of particular interest to emerging market and developing economies and  called on the FSB, IMF and World Bank to develop and report before the next  Summit. These issues include the management of foreign exchange risks by financial  institutions corporations and households...........   2 10. A recent policy note prepared by the IMF Staff puts the issue of cross-border capital  flows in perspective. It recognises the destabilising impact of capital floods and  droughts particularly on emerging economies, noting that volatile capital flows played  a key role in the recent crisis, both in increasing vulnerabilities and in transmitting  shocks across borders. Recently a group of more than 250 economists have written an  open letter to the US Government, explaining the benign influences of capital controls  and stressing the need for the US to dilute the capital control covenants in the U.S.  trade and investment treaties. Increasingly many EMEs are beginning to impose  capital controls and regulations, both of the traditional kind such as reserve  requirements, URR and restrictions on investment in debt including minimum   2 The Funds role regarding cross-border capital flows, IMF, November, 2010  3 investment period but also more innovative ones such as prudential measures,  administrative measures, tax measures and quantitative limits, particularly targeting  the derivative positions held by banks. Indeed, many of these derivatives were  initially invented to avoid precisely regulations on capital inflows or other types of  financial activity.   11. The key elements of this shift have been the following:   Ex-ante management of capital flows is now accepted as a legitimate  instrument of macroeconomic policy and financial stability. Though exchange  rate appreciation is still considered the preferred ex-post policy option in  dealing with inflows, intervention is now justified if there is major veering  away of the currency from its fundamental value.    The limitations of individual country-specific measures are being articulated.   The IMF policy note seeks to address the issue through development of rules  of the game for global capital flows and in fostering multilateral, non- discriminatory, approaches that look to the interest of both the originators and  recipients of capital. Is such a framework possible? I am not sure but till then  countries impacted by this would need to continue to find their answers.    It is increasingly being recognised that it is gross flows that determine risk  exposures and are therefore important for financial stability. Netting of cross- temporal flows does not capture the real impact of gross capital flows on  exchange rate as well as asset price impacts.     Capital control measures are being designed more innovatively for  effectiveness. Derivative transactions are increasingly being specifically  targeted and many countries are resorting to enhanced supervision and data  reporting to monitor the build up of currency positions in the books of banks.    The issue of capital flows is getting factored in the macroprudential  framework being envisaged for financial institutions globally.  Procyclicality  of capital flows and of wholesale market funding can engender vulnerabilities.  Prudential measures to address asset market volatility such as risk weights,  provisioning, LTV ratios, margin requirements and the build up of foreign  currency liabilities in the financial system are also considered as legitimate  instruments to respond to destabilising capital flows.   4  There is greater recognition of the insurance needs of countries. While it was  commonly argued before the crisis that many Asian countries were incurring  avoidable costs in accumulating large foreign currency reserves, it has been  widely noted that countries with large reserves fared relatively well during the  crisis. Forex reserves have provided self-insurance during the global liquidity  crisis. Those countries that built up precautionary reserve holding were able to  avoid large depreciation in the Panic of 2008 (Obstfeld, Shambaug, and  Taylor, 2009).    The argument for compositional irrelevance of capital flows stands  3 questioned. A recent IMF paper has concluded that the appreciation effect of  private flows differs by type of flow. Portfolio investments, which are more  volatile, have the highest appreciation effect, followed by FDI and bank loans.  Since these flows are potentially related to an increase in productive capacity,  the real appreciation associated with FDI and bank loans is barely one-seventh  of the real appreciation due to portfolio investments. Private transfers (mainly  remittances) are the flows that have the least appreciation effect. This may  suggest that remittances are not procyclical.    12. The cross-country experience of controls on inflows and outflows provides some  conjectures for policy purposes. These are summarised below:   It is evident that while the controls on capital inflows have proved somewhat  effective in containing pressures on foreign exchange markets, the  experiments with controls on outflows by the EMEs, particularly in crisis  situations did not help in alleviating the exchange market pressures.   While controls to limit short-term inflows could be helpful in specific  circumstances, such restrictions in force for longer-term entail costs. However,  temporary uses of controls are more effective and can even improve the  financial environment.   3 Jean-Louis Combes, Tidiane Kinda, and Patrick Plane: Capital Flows, Exchange Rate Flexibility, and the  Real Exchange Rate, IMF Working Paper, 2011   5  It is important to recognize that neither the use of capital controls is uniform  nor the results are identical. In addition, their impact can be subdued by global  conditions.   In case of pressures arising out of capital outflows, the controls in the form of  numerous restrictions on the banks external transactions were not fully  effective as they were circumvented in many instances.   Moreover, the various instruments of controls provided only temporary relief  or contained the initial pressures on forex markets when there were internal or  external imbalances (i.e., high fiscal deficit, weaknesses in the financial sector,  high current account deficit).   Offshore markets for the domestic currency (e.g., NDF markets) proved to be  an important source of speculation and in some instances control measures  could not succeed.    In case of crises countries, the instruments deployed to control outflows were  ultimately replaced by the abandonment of exchange rate band/peg in favour  of float.  Indian context  13. The policy approach in India to the issue of capital flows has evolved from the  broader objective of maintaining financial and macroeconomic stability and not  merely addressing the singular variable of exchange rate. The salient elements of this  framework have been:  (i) an explicitly stated active capital account management framework,  based on  the policy stance of encouraging non-debt creating and long-term capital  inflows and discouraging debt flows;   (ii) having the policy space to use multiple instruments - quantitative limits, price  based measures as well as administrative measures, particularly for foreign  currency borrowing by corporates;  (iii) short term debt permitted only for trade transaction;  (iv) avoiding the original sin of excessive foreign currency borrowings by  domestic entities, particularly the sovereign;  6 (v) prudential regulations to prevent excessive dollarization of balance sheets of  financial sector intermediaries, particularly banks;   (vi) cautious approach to liability dollarisation by domestic entities and    (vii) significant liberalization of permissible avenues for outward investments for  domestic entities.  Recent trends  14. During the past five years, like other Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), India has been  experiencing consistently strong capital flows, barring the crisis year of 2008-09. During the  crisis year of 2008-09, net capital flows plummeted to USD 6.8 (0.5 per cent of GDP) from  USD 106.6 billion (8.7 per cent of GDP) in 2007-08. The net capital flows again surged to  USD 53.6 billion (4.1 per cent of GDP) during 2009-10.  During the first half of 2010-11  (April-September 2010), the net capital flows were USD 36.7 billion, which was 59.6 per cent  higher than the net flows during the same period of the previous year (USD 23.0 billion).   15. The latest trends in capital flows indicate that the net capital flows during 2010-11 are  expected to be higher than in 2009-10. FII investment, ECBs and trade credit dominate  capital flows with FIIs flows remaining as the major driver of capital flows during the current  year so far.  During the period up to February 4, 2011, the net FIIs flows stood at USD 29.6  billion as against USD 22.4 billion during the corresponding period of 2009-10. The ECBs  registered during April-December 2010 amounted to USD 15.8 billion as against USD 13.8  billion during April-December 2009.

FCCBs have constituted a significant part of the ECBs raised during the last few  years, except for the sudden decline in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.   Table 2: Issuance of FCCBs  (USD million)    Total FCCBs  Total ECB Share of FCCB to  Year total ECBs (in per  cent)  2004-05 470 11,490 8  2005-06 2402 17,175 28  2006-07 5,736 25,352 20  2007-08 5,854 30,959 20  2008-09 27 18,362 1  2009-10 3,274 21,678 15  2010-11* 1,265 15,994 8   19,028  100    17. However, with focus on capital flows on a net basis, it is often not realized that  portfolio flows were US$174 billion a year over last three years on a gross basis, far  outstripping FDI flows at US$37 billion a year. In gross terms, over the last five years  (2005-06 to 2009-10) FII flows have accounted for 47% of the gross capital inflows to  India as against 9% for FDI inflows. This of course has more to do with the nature of  these flows with a much larger churn for portfolio capital. High gross flows make  economy more susceptible to such reversals and as such we need to continue to  maintain adequate buffers.  18. In the current context, a high CAD has been absorbing much of the capital flows in  aggregate terms. The concerns, however, arise on account of the composition of flows  coupled with lower order of reserves accretion and faster increase in external  liabilities.   19. The enhanced exposure to external liabilities is reflected in the sharp increase in the  ratio of external debt to foreign exchange reserves from 89.1 per cent of GDP in  2008-09 to 99.1 per cent as at end June 2010. Moreover, the ratio of short-term debt  to reserves has increased from 17.2 per cent to 21.0 per cent during the same period.  Another issue that may come up going forward relates to repayment of FCCBs. The  8 redemption pressures on account of FCCBs would start building up from 2010-11 and  peak in the next couple of years till 2012-13.   Table 3: FCCBs redemption profile (as on December 31, 2010)  FCCBs due for redemption   Year (USD million)  2010-11 1,169.24  2011-12 3622.7  2012-13 3757.74  2013-14 828.11  2014-15 2451.85  2015-16 482.5  Beyond 2016 699  Total 13,011.14    20. The relaxation of buy-back guidelines and refinancing has helped the corporates to  better plan for the impending repayments. The lessons of the crisis will hopefully lead  to better management and accounting of such liabilities by the corporates.   21. As is evident from the accretion to reserves and given the current account deficit,  unlike other central banks from emerging markets, RBI has been the least  interventionist. Indias foreign exchange reserves (excluding valuation effects)  increased by US$ 7.0 billion during the first half of 2010-1. Foreign exchange  reserves as on January 14, 2011 stood at US$ 297.4 billion. Though it is recognized  that foreign exchange reserves can only be partial antidote to capital flow volatilities,  they indeed work as comfort buffers during times of crisis.    Key issues and Road ahead  22. Going forward, the issue in our context is not really about the limited context of  capital flows but a more fundamental one of the capital account management  architecture which is responsive to the needs of the real economy and maintaining  financial stability. The issue of opening up of the capital account fully has become, so  to speak, the last frontier in reforming the financial sector. In some quarters, the  capital account constraint has come to be perceived as impacting other elements,  particularly the development of markets. However, what such arguments fail to  recognise is that the macroeconomic framework is an intricately inter-connected  9 model with several cross-impact elements. One cant touch just one element without  disturbing some other.    23. It thus becomes necessary to progress with liberalisation of different elements of the  capital account within the overall context. We have been measuring our readiness in  terms of certain metrics but these have proved to be contextually variable. The  practical approach seems to be to move towards further liberalisation but retain the  broad principles of the approach pursued hitherto. In this context, let me touch upon  the key issues in  regard to major elements:    FDI flows   FDI contributes to stable growth through transfer, diffusion and spill-over effects  and it is considered stable. Except for a few sectors the policy is liberal and  investments can be made under the automatic route. There have been some  concerns on the declining FDI flows in the recent past though as stated earlier it  has little to do with the regulatory framework per se except in certain sectors.  The  moderation in FDI inflows to India during April-November 2010 has been driven  by sectors such as construction, mining and business services. Certain structural   factors, if addressed expeditiously, could raise the share of India in the projected  FDI flows to EMEs in the near future. According to the IIF, net FDI flows to  EMEs are forecast to increase by 11 per cent in 2011.    In this context, it may need to be recognised that FEMA, in terms of its scope, is  concerned only with the transactions, both capital and current account, and not  with the economic activity per se.  FDI policy is not just a capital account issue  but is linked to Governments regulatory policies governing specific sectors that  are much broader in nature. This too needs to be addressed appropriately.      Portfolio flows   The Report of the Committee on Foreign Investment has recommended  introducing a single channel of foreign investments, QFI, for all foreign investors.  While the regulations for various channels is well appreciated, the Committee has  suggested opening up the QFI route to all foreign investors, including individuals,  subject to compliance with KYC requirements. The issue here is not merely  10 access to stock markets but has much larger implications. In effect, it would imply  permitting all foreign residents to open accounts in India for their transactions and  permitting them access to other market segments for their hedging requirements.  The entire gamut of ramifications needs to be thought through carefully as this  would result in full capital account convertibiity.  Investments in debt   The recent experience of many countries during the crisis as well as the worsening  external sector ratios for India preclude any case for further liberalising the debt  route. However, one issue that has been coming up regularly is that permitting  foreign investment in domestic-currency denominated debt securities poses much  less risks. While it is true that the currency risk in this case would be borne by  foreign investors but it is equally true that the impact-risks of floods and  droughts would be similar. In fact, this route would provide a channel for taking  currency views as well. When currency risks are hedged, in effect the currency  risk is transferred to domestic financial system/entities.    Having a dominant investor class in the short term segment, susceptible to sudden  stops and reversals, is clearly a risk from macreconomic perspective. As  illustrated by the chart below, FIIs have demonstrated a clear preference for short  term tenors, with 40% each of the investment in government and corporate debt  in tenors up to one year.

In case of sovereign borrowing, given the huge market borrowing  requirements, there will be increased susceptibility to global market  developments and rating changes if there is increased participation of foreign  investors. In the recent market turmoil, while the private sector did feel the  adverse impact of worsening global credit conditions, the sovereign borrowing  program was largely unaffected from direct impact on this count.   Outflows   The regime for outward flows by individuals, mutual funds as well as corporates,  has been significantly liberalised over the years.  The most visible manifestation  of this policy has been the increasing cross-border acquisitions by Indian  companies (Table 2).   Table 4: Outward FDI from India (USD MIO)  Year Equity  Loan Guarantee Total  Issued  2007-08 11291.92 2718.88 6959.97 20970.76  2008-09 10730..00 3313.86 3104.87 17148.74  2009-10 6738.85 3627.19 7603.79 17969.83  2010-11 (till 8445.53 6609.73 25233.16 40288.42  17.02.2011)    Liberalising outward flows may not be a solution to offset large portfolio inflows  as is often recommended. The modus operandi of overseas acquisitions is to  undertake acquisitions through SPVs overseas. The funding is often arranged  through overseas banks  backed either by shares or assets of the target company  and/or guarantees by the Indian parent. The actual outflow in the form of equity  and loans is therefore not equivalent to the actual value of the deals. Similarly, we  have allowed mutual funds to invest upto USD 8 billion overseas; only around  USD 1 billion of this limit has been used. Such outflows may potentially take  place at inopportune times from a systemic perspective. It this becomes  12 imperative from a financial stability perspective to have some prudential limits in  place.  Access to financial markets   One of the key arguments favouring a more open capital account has been the  attendant benefits it brings to the development of domestic markets. It was  believed that free capital flows into the financial markets are necessary for  efficient allocation of resources and for completion of markets by providing more  liquidity. The potency of this argument has at least partly been dented by the crisis  which has demonstrated that pursuit of development of financial markets per se  cannot be an end in itself.   However, trying to balance all objectives does bring its own challenges for  policymaking. It has been argued that in todays financial world of complex  derivatives, it is really not possible to have restrictive policies for flow of capital.  The significant increase in the NDF volumes involving INR is a case in point. The  recent BIS Triennial Survey was pretty revealing in this regard. From a regulatory  perspective, the real issue is the impact of this market on the onshore markets.   Our preliminary estimates have not been able to establish a causal relationship  between the NDF and onshore markets but going by the experience of other  countries, the NDF market can indeed be a source of vulnerability. It does raise  certain issues particularly regarding the nature of operations of banks as well as  corporates having cross-border presence which may need to be looked into.  Recently, there were reports that Korea has a similar audit of some overseas banks  over trading in currency derivatives which are suspected of being speculative  moves.     It is often suggested that the way to deal with the NDF market is to bring it  onshore. In other words allow non-deliverable forwards in the Indian market with  free access to all non-residents which have the same impact as full capital account  convertibility. This would essentially imply permitting non-residents access to  domestic markets irrespective of whether they have underlying exposures to  domestic markets or not. In other words allow them to trade foreign exchange  involving the rupee as a separate asset class. This could however lead to excessive  13 volatility in foreign exchange markets. It also has impact on other markets due to  inter-linkages. Such liberalisation makes domestic markets very vulnerable to  speculative attacks.  Is this opportune and advisable?      Another related issue is that of use of Rupee for trade invoicing. It is argued that  rupee invoicing may be a preferred option to help domestic exporters and  importers to deal with currency volatility. Even now, there are no regulatory  restrictions coming in its way. The issues are twofold: first, the acceptability of  rupee invoicing to the overseas trade counterparty; and two, the attractiveness of  rupee for credit facilities. Acceptability may be increased by devising a  mechanism to permit the overseas party to hedge its rupee exposures onshore. The  RBI is willing to examine this and I would urge FEDAI to come up with feasible  suggestions in this regard.    The guidelines on CDS will be released shortly. One of the issues is the access to  this market for FIIs. RBI is examining the suggestion to allow them to hedge the  credit risk in India provided they have invested in the underlying bonds.   Conclusion  24. The balance of costs and benefits of capital flows for recipient countries has started  getting reassessed in the aftermath of the crisis. A similar reassessment happened after  the Asian crisis. Many studies have since concluded that the cross-country evidence  on the growth benefits of capital-account openness is inconclusive and lacks  robustness. The present crisis, however, has led to a shift in the approach to capital  account from its narrow exchange rate implications and management of capital flows  is now accepted as a legitimate instrument of growth, macroeconomic policy and  financial stability. The role of forex reserves in providing insurance is also recognized  particularly since countries with large foreign exchange reserves were better  positioned to weather the liquidity crisis.     25. India has now had some experience with the above model of a framework and the  way forward seems to be continuing liberalisation within this framework.     26. To conclude, I would like to flag a few issues from a systemic perspective:  14  In an open economy like ours, there is need for greater recognition of currency  and interest rate risks and the risk management in banks and corporate firms need  to gear up their risk management practices further in this area. It is our experience  that a large number of corporates still do not have well-designed risk management  policies and practices to take care of volatile exchange rate movements and give  scant regard to tail risks. There is also need for greater disclosure and adherence to   accounting standards for financial instruments.   There is also need to more comprehensively qualitatively assess our external  liabilities to also encompass liabilities of subsidiaries and branches of Indian  financial institutions overseas, not in nominal terms but through a risk-based  approach on the probability of recourse to parent bank liquidity support.    Operations of foreign financial entities in domestic markets also have implications  on capital account due to cross border fund flow and derivative positions. During  the crisis period, funds were held abroad temporarily to support parent bank  liquidity. In India. there are prudential regulations on banks' recourse to overseas  funding markets, including for foreign banks. More local funding of local assets  reduces systemic risk and helps to curb excessive risk taking and credit growth.  27. I hope that we will continue to have constructive engagement with FEDAI and I wish  the conference all success.         15
