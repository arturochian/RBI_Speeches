5/14/2013 2 Seizing the demographic dividend 
“ On the one side is economic policy. On the other side is 
economic welfare. We are a developing country. The link 
between policy and welfare can be expressed in a few words: 
opportunities, education, skills, jobs and incomes. Every 
mother understands this. Every young man and woman 
understands this. My budget for 2013-14 has before it one 
overarching goal: to create opportunities for our youth to 
acquire education and skills that will get them decent jobs or 
self-employment that will bring them adequate incomes that 
will enable them to live with their families in a safe and secure 
environment.”  stated  Indian Finance Minister P Chidambaram 
while presenting the Union Budget for 2013-14.

5/14/2013 13 Main Issues - Challenges Ahead… 
? Literacy level very low mostly in rural / remote areas. 
 
? Dependence mainly on informal sources of credit from moneylenders on 
exploitative terms 
 
? Still perceived more as an obligation than a business opportunity by stake 
holders. 
 
? Appropriate Business Model by banks for enhancing its presence through 
involvement of all stakeholders to make Financial Inclusion & Literacy a reality. 
 
? Lack of Infrastructure necessary for scaling up: Physical and Technical 
Infrastructure. 
 
? Extension from banking products to other financial products
