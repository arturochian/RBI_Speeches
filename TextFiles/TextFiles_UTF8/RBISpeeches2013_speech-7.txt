In this backdrop, FERA, 1947 was replaced by Foreign Exchange RegulationAct,1973.Giventheimportanceofforeignexchange,itisnowonder thatthepurposeofthenewlegislationasstatedinthepreambletoActwas .fortheconservationoftheforeignexchangeresourcesofthecountryandthe proper utilisation thereof. and mandated that any contravention of the provision of the Act was treated as a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment.However,bythelate1970sGreenRevolutionhadaddressedour dependenceonimportedfoodgrainsandbuoyantremittancesfromdiaspora 3Indianshadbluntedtheurgencyofforeignexchangescarcity.Theliberalisationof the exchange control regime was started in the mid?1980s and gathered momentum in the 1990s. The liberalisation process ultimately culminated in replacementofFERA,1973withtheForeignExchangeManagementAct,1999. 8.WhatdidFEMAinvolve?Foraneconomicagentoramarketparticipant,the Actpersedidnotbringanyseachangeinthewayhewasdealingwithhisforeign exchange requirements.

The regulatory framework provided under FEMA has another important ingredient  it casts a great responsibility on the Authorised Persons the immediateandnecessarycounterpartytoeveryagent/participantforanyforeign exchangetransaction.IntheFERAregime,theirjobwasprettymuchsimple;they justhadtocarryoutatransactionaspertheRBIpermit.Asandwhenweattain fullcapitalaccountconvertibility,theirjobwillperhapsbesimpler.Butinthe regimethatobtainsnow,theyhavethedifficultbutimportanttaskofmakinga judgementonpermissibilityofatransaction.Recognisingthis,FEMAempowers authorisedpersonstosatisfythemselvesaboutanyforeignexchangetransaction 4thatthecustomermaywishtocarryout,butatthesametimeprovidesthatin caseanauthorisedpersonformsanopinionthatatransactionisnotpermissible, ithastodosoinwritingandgivingreasons. 10.LetmegobacktothepreambleofFEMA.Aswehaveseenanimportantpart oftheobjectiveofFEMAistofacilitatetradeandpayments.Withcurrentaccount fullyconvertible,almostentirefocusoftheregulatoryframeworkunderFEMAis onthecapitalaccounttransactions.Thequestionthenisthis.Istheregulatory framework that faces an economic agent or a market participant  be it an investororaninvestee,alenderoraborrower?conduciveenoughtofacilitate variouscapitalaccounttransactions?LestIammisunderstood,letmeclarifythatI amnotadvocatingagreaterdegreeofcapitalaccountopennessorbeingmore permissiveinrespectofthisorthatclassofcapitalaccounttransactions.Thepace ofcapitalaccountliberalisationwillbedictatedbyahostoffactorsincluding macroeconomicconditions,financialstabilityissuesandsoon.Mylimitedpointis thatoncethepolicyframeworkhasbeenspeltout,theimplementationhastobe suchthatanyonearesidentormoreimportantlyanon?resident?contemplating acapitalaccounttransactionknowsclearlyandunambiguouslywhatcanbedone, howitcanbedoneandwithinwhattimeframeitcanbedone.Idonotthinkwe havesucceededtoowellinthisobjective,atleastnotasmuchasweshouldhave. Letmeelaborate. 11. Let us start with the regulatory framework. Excluding the 26 original notifications containing Regulations pertaining to mostly capital account transactions, there have been a total of 263 notifications amending the regulations originally made or subsequently amended. Another dozen or so amendmentsareinthepipeline.AfterFEMAwasintroduced,thenumberof directivesissuedtotheauthorisedpersonswas36in2001?02;ithadincreased to138during2011?12,122during2012?13andasmanyas77inlessthan5 monthsinthecurrentyear.ThetwogiganticvolumesofTaxmansExchange ManagementManualinsmallandcloseprints?lookasformidableasany elaboratecommentaryonthemostcomplexlaw.Indeed,Itwillnotsurprisemeif someone points out an inconsistency or contradiction between two different 5directionsornotifications.Sohavewesimplifiedorcomplicated?Isittimefora comprehensivereview?Tomymind,itisanemphaticyes. 12.Animportantfactorinthiscontextisthatcapitalaccountmanagementhas oftenbeenusedasaninstrumentindealingwithrupeevolatility.When,during 2006?2008,wewereinundatedwithcapitalinflowsandmarketinterventionwas unequal to the task of stemming sharp appreciation of the Rupee, we took measurestosteminflowsandspuroutflows.Forinstance,wereducedinterest rates on non?resident deposits, discouraged ECBs, and encouraged capital outflows.Again,betweenDecember2006andSeptember2007,theannuallimit for almost no?questions?asked remittance facility for individuals (under the LiberalisedRemittanceSchemeintroducedin2004)wasraisedinthreestages fromUSD25,000toUSD200,000.Thisfacilitywasusedbyseveralpeopletopool theremittanceallowedtoeachoftheirfamilymembersatermleftundefinedin FEMAortheRegulationsframedthereunder?tobuypropertiesabroad.Indian corporatessettingupsubsidiariesorjointventuresabroadwerepermittedto remituptofourtimestheirnetworthundertheautomaticroute.Imentionthese two because these were the ones that were modified in the wake of sharp depreciation of the Rupee in August 2013, a step which was seen a few commentatorsasharbingerofcapitalcontrols. 13.Similarly,whenRupeeexhibitedastrongdepreciatingtrendcreatingapanic? likesituationinthemarket,wehaverespondedwithsometweakingofthecapital account restrictions. For instance, we have expanded the scope of external commercialborrowingsinregardtoenduseandeligibleborrowers.Wehave increasedthelimitforFIIsinvestmentinsovereignandcorporatedebt.Wehave also deregulated or increased the interest rates on non?resident deposits. Recently,weevenencouragedFCNRdepositsandbanksborrowingfromtheir branches,principals,correspondentsandinternational/multilateralinstitutionsby offeringaconcessionalswapfacility.ThepointthatIwishtomakeisthatsince capitalaccountmeasureshavebeenactivelyusedfordealingwithturbulencein foreignexchangemarkets,hasitperhapscontributedtoacomplexandifImay sayso,atime?inconsistentregulatoryframework?Doesthisapproachtherefore requirere?calibrationafterareview? 614.ThesecondissueIwishtoemphasizeonistheevolutioninthewaybusinessis doneandfinancialinnovation.Letusrememberthatmuchoffinancialinnovation isindeedwhatisoftencalledregulatorybypass.Marketparticipantsalways explorewaystocircumnavigatearoundtheregulatoryroadblocks,towhichthe regulatorsrespondwithalagbyerectingmoreroadblocks.Inthisgame,itis inevitablethattheregulatoryframeworkendsupbeingcomplex.Whiletoolittle regulation,particularlyinthefinancialsector,runstheriskoffinancialinstability, too much regulation throttles enterprise, makes innovation impossible and squeezestheeaseofdoingbusiness.AsTSEliotobserved,albeitinadifferent context,thedangeroffreedomisdeliquescence;thedangerofstrictorderis petrification.So,thequestionis:howtoachievetherightbalance? 15.Letustaketheareaofinboundforeigninvestmentforexample.Thetwoways ofinvestmentinanenterpriseareeitherthroughdirectinvestmentorthrough portfolioinvestment.Directinvestmentisdefinedintermsoflastinginterest which implies the existence of a long?term relationship between the direct investorandthedirectinvestmententerpriseandasignificantdegreeofinfluence onthemanagementofthelatter.Aclassicwayofforeigndirectinvestment wouldbewhenanon?residententitysetsupawhollyownedsubsidiaryorforms ajointventureinthehostcountry.Theequitysharesareacquiredsimultaneously astheyarecreated.Whataboutanon?residentacquiringalastinginterestina residentcompanythroughmergers,acquisitionsandtake?overs?Supposeanon? resident FDI investor wishes to increase its stake by progressively buying up shares in the stock exchange within the framework provided by the security regulator;shoulditbetreatedasFDIorportfolioinvestment?Recentlywhenthe Anglo?DutchmultinationalUnileverincreaseditsstakeinHindustanUnileverby about14.8%atacostofUSD3.6billionthroughanopenoffer,theextentof equitysharestenderedbyForeignInstitutionalInvestorswasexcludedfromFDIin oursystem,thankstothereportingsystemsetupinlinewiththeregulatory provisions. 16.IntheoriginalFEMAregulations,itwasprovidedthatitwasinordertoissuea partially convertible debenture against foreign direct investment. In 2006?07, when external commercial borrowing was discouraged, companies responded 7withanobviousdodge:apartiallyconvertibledebenturewithanominalpart slated to be converted to equity was used to camouflage a commercial borrowing.Werespondedbyexcludingapartiallyconvertibledebenturefromthe listofsecuritiesthatcanbeissuesagainstFDIandtobetreatedasadebt.Iam afraidthegameisnotyetoverbecausetheviceoftreatingapartiallyconvertible debentureasdebtisthatsomeday,whenappropriateincentivesarethere,itcan beusedtocamouflageanequityinvestment. 17.Whataboutportfolioinvestment?Itistruethattherehasnotbeenmuch changeintheregimeasfarasportfolioinvestmentinequityisconcernedevenas thelimitofinvestmentinfixed?incomemarkethasbeenprogressivelyincreased.

Thusitmaynotbesufficienttolubricateourmarketsinthehopethatforeign investorswouldevinceagreatdealofinterest.Atimehascomeperhapsforus, withinthebroadcontoursofourcapitalaccountmanagement,totakeourassets to off?shore markets through appropriate institutional framework.
