Asia's Urban Century: Emerging Trends*Rakesh MohanI. Urbanisation: A Recent PhenomenonWidespread all pervading urbanisation is a truly twentiethcentury phenomenon. Although cities have always existed, even citiessuch as Memphis, Babylon, Thebes, Athens, Sparta, Mohen-ja-daroand Anuradhapura existed in antiquity, there is little evidence ofwidespread urbanisation in the early years of civilization. Rome wasperhaps the first settlement to reach 1 million people in BC; only in1800 did London become the second city to reach this population size.In 1800, only 2 per cent of the world’s population was urbanised.By the year 1900, out of a total world population of close to 1.5 to 1.7billion, only 15 percent of the population, about 250 million, lived andworked in urban areas, a number lower than the total urban populationof India alone today.  By the year 1950 the proportion of urban to totalglobal population had risen to 30 per cent, with Europe, North Americaand Oceania having the highest levels of urbanisation then. By the year2000, 2.8 billion people lived in urban areas equaling approximately 49percent of the world's population.  So the pace of urbanisationwitnessed in the twentieth century was truly unprecedented, and it is awonder that the world has coped as well as it has.  We are now at aturning point in human history: the number of people living in cities isabout to exceed those in the countryside, perhaps in this calendaryear.The last 50 years have been truly remarkable in terms of thenumber of people who have been successfully absorbed in cities in atime period that is incredibly short by historical standards. While theworld’s urban population grew by approximately 500 million between1900 and 1950, it grew by 2.1 billion in the next fifty years; and isexpected to grow by a similar magnitude in just the next thirty years.The speed of urbanisation in Latin America in the second half of thetwentieth century was spectacular, vaulting from a just over 40 percenturbanisation level to 75 percent by the end of this period which wasalso a period of rapid population growth and demographic transition. Asmay be seen (Table 1) the focus of change is now in Asia with theurban population expected to double in the next 30 years or so. Thisphenomenon of such rapid urbanisation is indeed unprecedented and it                                                * Keynote Address by Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Conference on LandPolicies and Urban Development, organised by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,Cambridge, Massachusetts on June 5, 2006.

In the process thecomplexion of development objectives and processes has alsoundergone significant change.In the last two centuries, cities have consistently provided theenvironment for institutional and technological innovation, and haveoften been referred to as “engines of economic growth”; “agents ofchange” and “incubators of innovation”.  Between 1960 and 2000 worldoutput went up four fold, while urban population almost tripled, takingthe world from 33 percent urban to 47 percent urban in forty years(Table 2).Table 1: Urban Population Growth across the GlobeUrban Urban Urban UrbanRegion Population Population Population Population1900 1950 2000 2030in Per in Per in Per in PerMillion cent Million cent of Million cent of Millions cent ofs of s total s total totaltotalAfrica 32 14.7 295 37.2 787 52.9Asia 244 17.4 1376 37.5 2679 54.1Latin 70 41.9 391 75.4 608 84.0America &CaribbeanOceania 8 61.6 23 74.1 32 77.3Europe 287 52.4 534 73.4 540 80.5North 110 63.9 243 77.4 335 84.5AmericaGlobal Total ~25 ~ 15 751 29.8 2862 47.2 4981 60.20Increase 501 14.8 2111 17.4 2119 13.0Source: United Nations (2002)Table 2: Global GDP and Growth in Urban Population1960 1970 1980 2000World GDP (constant 1995 $ trillion) 7.9 13.5 19.5 34.3Share of agriculture in world GDP - -  6.5  3.9Share of industry in world GDP - - 38.0 20.8Share of services in world GDP - - 55.5 66.3World population (mm) 3020 3675 4428 6053Per cent urban population 33.3 36.5 39.3 46.7Source: World Bank database.The twenty-first century will therefore be an urban century.  Forthe first time in human history, more people will live in cities than in thecountryside. The urban situation will get more pronounced as thecentury unfolds. As in the last fifty years, developing countries will beurbanising at a much more rapid pace than developed countries.A review of the regional dynamics of urbanisation revealsinteresting developments (Table 3). There has been a dramatic shift ofthe fulcrum of urban population away from Europe and North Americato the developing regions of the world. During the period 1950-2000,the growth rate of urban population in Europe and North America wasabout 1.5 per cent.  The share of Europe and North America in globalurban population declined from about 53 per cent  in 1950 to 27.5 percent  in 2000 and is expected to decline further to about 17 per cent  by2030.  Africa has experienced consistent high growth in its urbanpopulation, which grew at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent  during 1950-2000, and its share in global urban population is expected to rise to 16per cent  by 2030 (from 4.3 per cent  in 1950). Latin America has nowbecome predominantly urban, surpassing urbanisation levels in Europeand will almost be at par with North America by 2030. Interestingly,Asia is where almost half of urban population of the world lives andsoon it will have the majority of the world's urban population.Table 3: Global Urbanisation Trends: Level of Urbanisation(Per cent)Region 1920 2030World Total 19 61Less Developed Regions 10 57Africa 7 54Asia 9 55Latin America 22 85More Developed Regions 40 85Europe 46 83North America 52 85Oceania 47 75Source: Mohan and Dasgupta (2005)It is now well established that the acceleration of urbanisationgenerally takes place with corresponding acceleration of economicgrowth. Urbanisation is promoted by (i) economies of scale inproduction particularly in manufacturing; (ii) the existence ofinformation externalities; (iii) technology development, particularly inbuilding and  transportation technology; (iv) substitution of capital forland as made possible by technological developments.  Informationasymmetries contribute to agglomeration economies.  As economies ofscale in production begin to take hold larger size plants becomenecessary, thus contributing to the need for larger settlements ofpeople.  The services needed by the rising agglomeration of peoplegives rise to an even greater number of people living together: thuscities are born and how they grow.  As technology develops and capitalis substituted for land, taller buildings become possible, intensifyingpopulation densities further.  Similarly, technology development intransportation, enabling faster speeds, enables people to live at greaterdistances thus contributing to the expansion of city size.  The existenceof agglomeration economies gives rise to continuing accretion ofpeople in a settlement, thus promoting city growth.  These linkagesbecome more prominent with economic growth thereby promoting theacceleration of urbanisation.  With the growing weights of industry andservices in developing countries, urbanisation has proceeded apaceover the last 50 years. As we will see, the relatively concentratedpattern of Asian urbanisation that has occurred along with a very highrate of economic growth perhaps best illustrates the economic gainsaccruing from agglomeration economies and economies of scale.II Asia Becomes UrbanPresently the highest rates of economic growth are beingwitnessed in Asia, and hence high urban growth.  This is particularlynoticeable in China and India, which today have the largest ruralpopulations but are urbanising rapidly.  Even in other Asian countrieswhere a large number of cities are witnessing high rates of economicgrowth, the growth in their urban population is also going to be higher.Of the 10 most populous countries, 6 are in Asia (Table 4). Even asmore than two billion people will be added to Asia’s population in thenext 30 years many of these countries will still be rapidly urbanising.This phenomenon has now gained such prominence that even popularnews magazines have begun to take note (Newsweek, 2003). This isalso reflected in Figure 1 which shows that rural population in Asia isexpected to decline, in absolute terms during 2000-2030, yet anotherunprecedented event, while urban population will almost double duringthe same period. Therefore, while thinking and thought processesrelated to urbanisation were dominated by the growth of urbanisation instLatin America between 1950 and 2000, the 21 Century will be the“Asian Urban Century”.Table 4: Emergence of Mega Cities:Population of Cities with 10 million or more inhabitants(in Millions)1950 1975 2000 2015New 12.3 1 Tokyo 19.8 1 Tokyo 25.2 1 Tokyo 27.2York2 New 15.9 2 Sao Paulo 18.3 2 Dhaka 22.8York3 Shangh 11.4 3 Mexico 18.3 3 Mumbai 22.6ai City4 Mexico 10.7 4 New York 16.8 4 Sao Paolo 21.25 Sao 10.3 5 Mumbai 16.5 5 Delhi 20.9Paulo 6 Los 13.3 6 Mexico 20.4Angeles City 7 Kolkata 13.3 7 New York 17.9 8 Dhaka 13.2 8 Jakarta 17.3 9 Delhi 13.0 9 Kolkata 16.7 10 Shanghai 12.8 10 Karachi 16.2 11 Buenos 12.1 11 Lagos 16.0Aires 12 Jakarta 11.4 12 Los 14.5Angeles 13 Osaka 11.0 13 Shanghai 13.6 14 Beijing 10.8 14 Buenos 13.2Aires 15 Rio de 10.8 15 Metro 12.6Janerio Manila 16 Karachi 10.4 16 Beijing 11.7 17 Metro 10.1 17 Rio de 11.5Manila Janerio  18 Cairo 11.5  19 Istanlbul 11.4  20 Osaka 11.0        21 Tianjin 10.3Source: United Nations (2002).Figure 1: Growth in Urban and Rural Population in Asia overthe YearsSource: UN, 2002By 2030, Asia alone will have about 2.7 billion urban peopleaccounting for over 50 per cent of its total population.  All the otherregions of the world will have a combined urban population of about 2.3billion.  Six of the 10 countries with the largest urban populations are inAsia. Urbanisation in Bangladesh has been among the fastest  in theworld (5.6 per cent during 1950-2000). The only African country in thetop 10 list, Nigeria, has also urbanized very rapidly in the past 5decades (World Urbanisation Prospects, 2001).  Interestingly, by 2010,Lagos is projected to become the third largest city in the world.Moving to the city level urbanisation trends, the growth of urbanagglomerations in developing countries has far exceeded that indeveloped countries. In 1950, there was only one city with a populationof over 10 million people : New York City. In 2000 there were 17 citieswith a population above 10 million, 22 cities with population between 5and 10 million; 402 with a population of 1 to 5 million; and 433 in the0.5 to 1 million category.  An important characteristic of urbanisation inAsia has been the emergence of mega-cities – large multi-nuclearurban agglomerations of more than 10 million people.  There were nosuch agglomerations in Asia in 1950, two in 1975 and by 2000, 10 ofthe 17 global megacities were in Asia.  It is expected that 12 out of the21 mega cities in the year 2015 will be in Asia (Table 4).Of the 21 cities expected to reach 10 million plus by 2015, 17 ofthem will be in developing countries. Of these 17 cities, 11 of them willbe in developing countries in Asia  and those will be Dhaka, Mumbai,Delhi, Jakarta, Kolkata, Karachi, Shanghai, Metro Manila, Beijing,Istanbul and Tianjin (Table 5).Table 5: Out of the 10 Most Populous Countries 6 are Asian  1950 2000 2030  Per Population Per Population Per Population Countrycent (mn) cent (mn) cent (mn)urban urban urban1 China 12.5 555 35.8 1275 59.5 14852 India 17.3 357 29.0 1009 40.9 14093 USA 64.2 158 77.2 283 84.5 3584 Brazil 36.5 54 81.2 170 90.5 2265 Indonesia 12.4 79 41.0 212 63.7 2836 Nigeria 10.1 30 44.1 114 63.6 2207 Pakistan 17.5 40 33.1 141 48.9 2738 Mexico 42.7 28 74.4 99 81.9 1359 Japan 50.3 84 78.8 127 84.8 1211 Banglade 4.3 42 25.0 137 44.3 2230 shSource: United Nations (2002)The historical pattern of urbanisation suggests that countriestend to urbanise very slowly until they attain urbanisation levels ofaround 25 to 30 per cent.  The pace of economic growth and overalldevelopment then quickens, with rapid structural shifts occurring in theeconomy, away from agriculture to industry and services.  The pace ofurban growth between urbanisation levels of 25 to 30 per cent and 55to 60 per cent has typically been observed to take place in a very shorthistorical time frame of 25 to 50 years.  This happened in Europeancountries and North America at different times in the late nineteenthcentury and early twentieth century, and in Latin America during thelatter half of the twentieth century.  Japan went from about 25 per centurbanisation level in 1930 to over 70 per cent in 1970; and Korea fromabout 25 per cent urban in 1955 to 50 per cent by 1975. During thisrapid phase of urbanisation, the demand for urban infrastructureinvestment is massive and countries have usually been observed toneed external savings to supplement available domestic resources tofinance such investment.  So far, the world has been able to cope withsuch demands as the scene of urbanisation has shifted from oneregion to another and the overall magnitude of increase in urbanpopulation has been manageable.  What is new in the next 25 to 30years is that three of the world's most populous countries, China, Indiaand Indonesia, with combined total population of about 2.5 billion willbe undergoing this process simultaneously, with Pakistan andBangladesh not much far behind.  The magnitude of the increase inurban population in Asia in this period will be unprecedented and willundoubtedly give rise to unforeseen problems as well as opportunities.The popular view of towns and cities in developing countries,and of the urbanisation process, is a negative one, despite the benefitsit brings.  For many, the emergence of such cities connotesenvironmental degradation, the generation of slums, rampant urbanpoverty and unemployment, loss of control and traffic chaos.  But whatis the reality?  Given the unprecedental increase in urban populationover the last 50 years from 300 million in 1950 to 2 billion in 2000 indeveloping countries, the wonder really is how well the world hascoped, and not how badly.  In general, the urban quality of life hasimproved in terms of availability of water and sanitation, power, health,education, telephones, and the like, and poverty has fallen.  Theseimprovements must be viewed against the fact that they have beenachieved in the presence of rapidly increasing population, underdifficult fiscal situations, and with strained human resources for theemerging needs of public management.By way of illustration, we can look at the coverage of water andsanitation services in Asian cities.  As presented in table 6 a largenumber of urban residents have been provided with improved water inurban areas in Asia’s largest countries. Although in some countriessuch as China, Indonesia and the Philippines, the access to improvedwater in terms of percentage of total urban population seems to havedeclined from 1990 to 2000, in absolute numbers, millions of additionalcitizens have actually been provided improved services.  Although thedefinition of urban areas as well as the concept of improved waterservices varies across the different countries referred to in the followingtables, the increase in access is documented by each country withintheir own definitions as presented here. In the four countries takentogether, an additional population of approximately 262 million hasbeen provided with improved access to water in urban areas during the1990s, which is a population greater than that of most countries today.Table 6: Improvement in Access to Water in Urban Asia Per cent  of urban population with AdditionalCountry access to people Improved water provided(million)1990 2000 1990 to 2000China 99 94 115India 88 95 107Indonesia 92 90 27Philippines 93 91 12Korea, Rep. 97Source: World Bank database, 2003These countries in Asia have made significant progress in theprovision of sanitation services too, together providing for an additionalpopulation of more than 293 million citizens within a decade. In thisparameter there has been a consistent increase in the percentage ofurban population covered in all the countries (Table 7).This general improvement in access to urban infrastructure andservices in the Asian cities can be observed in other sectors too suchas health services, education and housing. Looking at the change inpoverty levels too is revealing; in terms of both nutrition levels and lifeexpectancy most of the Asian urban areas have seen consistentprogress. However, in income poverty terms the experience has beenmixed, bringing to the fore the importance of macro-economicmanagement of a country, and its relevance for urban povertyreduction. In India, a steady macro economic environment andeconomic growth in the 1990s has led to steady improvement inincome poverty levels.Table 7: Improvement in Sanitation Facilities in Urban AsiaCountry Per cent  of urban Additionalpopulation with access to people provided(million)Improved sanitationfacilities1990 2000 1990 to 2000China 57 68 130India 44 61 96Indonesia 66 69 23Philippines 85 93 15Korea, Rep. 76 29Source: World Bank database, 2003Progress in the provision of essential urban services has beensignificant. Unlike the popular view that urbanisation causesdeprivation, urbanisation has been relatively well addressed in Asiancities and has led to an increase in living standards and quality of life ofits residents. Given the (i) vast increase in urban population in thesecountries, (ii) low per capita income, (iii) constrained fiscalcircumstances of governments, leading to low expenditure on urbaninfrastructure, and (iv) the existence of weak local governments in mosturban areas, the progress achieved is indeed quite noteworthy.  In allprobability the quality of life in developing Asian urban areas isth thsignificantly better than the situation witnessed in the 18 and 19centuries in European cities, which had grown under similarcircumstances, but perhaps at higher prevailing income levels. We mayalso recall that they did not have to cope with mega cities during theirphase of rapid urbanisation.  These achievements have probably beenenabled by the availability of better technology and systems now.III. Some Distinctive Features of Asian Urban GrowthThe rapid economic growth of Asia in the last half century mustbe amongst the most spectacular periods of development in recordedhuman history. The magnitude of population that has benefitted fromthis growth far surpasses that of the rest of the world, and in particularof Western Europe and North America. Broadly speaking, the evolvingpattern of Asian urbanisation has naturally corresponded to the shiftingfocus of economic growth over this period.Economic growth in Asia was kindled by the remarkable postWorld War II recovery of Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, and stretchinginto the 1980s when Japan became the second largest economy in theworld. A particular characteristic of Japanese economic and urbangrowth was the heavy concentration of economic activity in theTokkaido region (Tokyo - Nagoya - Osaka corridor), which was aidedand abetted by an apparent conscious choice of concentratedinfrastructure investment in this region. The Japanese economybenefited from high savings and investment rates (almost 40 per centof GDP by 1970) during this period, which provided the resourcesnecessary for the heavy transportation and urban infrastructureinvestments that were made. The rapid increase in manufacturinginvestment and production gave rise to high growth in manufacturingemployment that was responsible for very high rates of rural urbanmigration.  The Japanese countryside was literally drained of peopleduring this period and the Tokkaido region became one of the mostdensely populated urban corridors in the world. Between 1950 and1970 Japan's rural population fell from its peak of about 52 million toless than 30 million; by then almost 40 per cent of Japan's totalpopulation, and as much as 60 per cent of its urban population wasconcentrated in the 500 km Tokkaido coastal corridor (Mills and Ohta,1970).  The kind of economic concentration that emerged was perhapsinstrumental in economizing on infrastructure investment that wouldhave been larger had it been spread out over a larger part of thecountry. The geographical proximity of different activities gave rise toagglomeration economies that aided rapid productivity growth and alsoenabled innovation in traditional production processes through theintroduction of new systems such as  Just-in-Time (JiT) modes ofinventory management.  Such innovations enabled much moreoutsourcing of components, a process that contributed to the drasticreduction in manufacturing costs that was the foundation of Japan'scompetitiveness.  The more efficient inventory management resultingfrom JiT and overall supply management has also enabled significantreduction in corporate need for bank financing, leading to significantchanges in bank portfolios.  Creativity and innovation have beenamong the distinctive characteristics of Japanese economic and urbangrowth.The focus of growth began to shift later to the Asian tigers: HongKong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. What is noteworthy is thatthe overall pattern of growth was similar in these countries. Singaporeand Hong Kong being city states were, of course, somewhat differentand had to exhibit concentrated growth. But South Korea and Taiwanalso concentrated on specialising in manufacturing.  Like Japan theyfirst specialized in labour intensive low technology goods productionand then began to move up the technology chain.  While Koreanmanufacturing production was concentrated in large manufacturingconglomerates, that of Taiwan was spread over a large proportion ofsmall and medium enterprises. However, they both exhibited a strategyof concentrated spatial development in urban concentrations,Seoul/Pusan in Korea and Taipei/Kaohsing in Taiwan.  The Seoul andPusan metropolitan regions accounted for almost 70 per cent of SouthKorea's urban population by the mid 1970s (Mills and Song, 1979p.188).  Each of the Tigers adopted an export-oriented and outwardorientated strategy, which also necessitated heavy investments in keytransportation and communication links with the rest of the world. Theeconomic activities located in these cities were as connected with therest of the world as with their hinterlands, if not more.  This commonheavy spatial concentration in these countries, Japan, South Korea andTaiwan, can perhaps also be attributed to the fact that they are amongthe most densely populated countries in the world.Given the success of the tigers, it was then the turn of the cubs,the South East Asian countries of Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysiaduring the 1980s. Once again, the pattern of concentrated heavyinvestment was repeated in the metropolitan cities of Bangkok, Jakartaand Kuala Lumpur. The orientation here was also export oriented andhence, again, heavy investment had to be incurred in transportationand communication links, and in urban infrastructure. The urban development pattern that emerged in Asia was thatof concentrated development around coastal regions of each country.Moreover, the transportation links that grew between these coastalcities in terms of economic linkages of communication, transportationand commerce, contributed to the emergence of trans-border virtualurban corridors. In fact, a look at the Asian urbanisation pattern as ithas emerged reveals a long almost continuous urban coastal corridorstretching from Tokyo to Sydney, through Seoul, Taipei, Shanghai,Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Jakarta (Douglas, 1998).Interestingly, early Chinese economic and urban growth in the1980s and 1990s was also the result of a similar strategy: export-oriented labour-using manufacturing located in the coastal areas;initially in and around Shanghai and in the whole Pearl River DeltaRegion.   Once again, infrastructure investment was concentrated inthe Special Economic Zones and, as in the other countries, heavy ruralurban migration ensued.  Given the size of China it is, of course, noteasy to portray its pattern of urbanisation.  Until the 1990s, rural urbanmigration was heavily constrained through the urban residence permitsystem, which has since been loosened considerably.   Although thereis a great degree of debate on the actual level of Chinese urbanisation,in 2000 it was somewhere between 30 and 36 per cent.  It now hasabout 90 cities with more than 1 million population.  The Chineseauthorities have a clear priority objective of accelerating urbanisation toabsorb surplus labour from rural areas into more productive urbansystems (Webster, 2005).In contrast to this common experience, the Indian strategy wasalmost a mirror image of the East and South East Asian strategy.  Theethos was of dispersed development: urban concentration was frownedupon and actively discouraged; and the import substituting inwardoriented manufacturing approach persisted till the 1980s.   Investmentin infrastructure, particularly urban infrastructure has been of lowerintensity.   As I have documented elsewhere, unlike the East and SouthEast Asian countries, during the period of accelerating economicgrowth in India in the 1980s and 1990s, although industrial growth washigh, manufacturing employment and urban population growthdecelerated (Mohan and Dasgupta, 2004).  Despite being a peninsulawith a long coastline, there was no attempt to concentrate economicactivity in the coastal areas: in fact growth in the old concentrations ofCalcutta, Madras and Bombay (now Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai)slowed down in the 1980s and 1990s while, interestingly, inland citiessuch as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi prospered.  There haveperhaps been few such examples of inland cities growing faster thancoastal cities and regions.The fulcrum of global economic growth has now shifted to thelarge economies of China and India.  In the case of China, with theinitial growth impetus having come from the coastal zones, theemphasis is now shifting to inland cities.  Although economic growthhas perhaps now got more concentrated regionally in India, there is stilllittle evidence of strategy shifting to the promotion of greater urbanconcentrations.  So the export led, coastal urban growth that has beencharacteristic of Asian urban growth in the last 50 years can now beexpected to move inland in the large land masses of India and China.Such a pattern of urban growth will probably necessitate higher degreeof infrastructure investment - both intra-urban and inter-urban in orderto ensure international economic competitiveness.IV. Emerging Issues for the Next Wave of Asian UrbanisationBy all accounts Asia has coped well with the unprecedentedmagnitude of urbanisation that it has experienced in the last 50 years.The Asian habitat pattern has been transformed over a historically brieftime period: an Asian is now almost as likely to be found living in anurban area as in a rural area, with a high probability of being found in acity of significant size. Because of the particular economic strategyfollowed over much of Asia, its cities are engines of economic activityexhibiting ever increasing productivity gains and prosperity. This hasenabled Asia to finance its urban infrastructure investment withoutexcessive international borrowing. In fact, the financial surplus that theregion is now exporting to other regions of the world has come as a bitof a surprise, given its own resource needs for continuing investment,particularly in the infrastructure needed for further urbanisation.Although the rate of urbanisation will, no doubt, slow downoverall, the magnitude of urban population accretion in Asia over thenext 30 years will be roughly equal to that experienced in the last 50years.  In fact, this next wave of urbanisation in Asia will be the largestin magnitude over any 30 year period in human history. The keyquestion that arises is whether the region will have enough resourcesto cope with this magnitude of urbanisation. It is the most populouscountries of China, India and Indonesia, along with Pakistan andBangladesh, which will undergo large urbanisation during this period,even though the pace of change may well be faster in other countriessuch as Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.China seems to have invested adequately in infrastructurealready and there would appear to be little doubt of its ability togenerate enough internal resources to finance its investment needsover the foreseeable future and its ability to attract external resources ifneeded. In fact, given the current magnitude of its current accountsurplus, coupled with the flow of external savings into the country, andthe large magnitude of forex reserves invested elsewhere, it hasenough of a cushion to meet most if not all its needs in the foreseeablefuture. As I have discussed, the change that can be expected is that ofa change in focus towards inland cities. The question that then arises iswhether these cities will be productive and competitive enough toproduce the economic surpluses necessary for their continuedsustainability. The attainment of such productivity will necessarily meangreater inter-urban infrastructure investment, so that these cities arewell integrated with their coastal cousins. Furthermore, given theinformation technology and communication revolution, along with thesecular decline in per unit air transportation costs, they can now alsobe connected to the rest of the world without intermediation of thecoastal cities. But this would also mean that they will need to specializemore in service industries, rather than in manufacturing; the latter couldbe handicapped in global competitiveness because of excessivetransport costs. Thus, it is certainly the case that much greater inter-urban infrastructure investment will be necessary to make these citiescompetitive.  It would appear that this has already begun in China in allthe various facets of infrastructure: road, rail, airports andtelecommunications.The Indian story is somewhat different with relatively lowattention being paid to urban development over the years, and slowingurbanisation over the last quarter century. There have been systematicpolicy biases against labour using industrialization, location ofindustries in urban areas, and against urban concentrations.Correspondingly, India has severe problems in both the managementand financing of cities. With the new found economic resurgence ofIndia, a result of consistent economic reforms since the early 1990s,the importance of urban infrastructure investment has finally begun tooccupy the minds of key policy markers and a new "National UrbanRenewal Mission" has been launched. However, the biases againstlabour using manufacturing remain in overall economic policy making,in the industrial regulatory regime, labour regulations and in urban landpolicy. Thus employment growth in manufacturing remains low. As Ihave argued elsewhere, these polices could have contributedsignificantly to the slow down observed in Indian urbanisation over thelast quarter century (Mohan and Dasgupta, 2004).Industrial competitiveness in India has now recovered after theshock of competition having been absorbed through significantfinancial and business process restructuring in Indian firms.  The exportorientation of Indian industry at large has also increased significantly inrecent years.  On average (since 2000-01), about 14 per cent of salesof Indian firms is now exported and this proportion continues to grow,as compared with 7 per cent in 1991-92.  Consequently, the continuedhigh growth of the Indian economy would get strengthened if theefficiency of Indian cities improves.  It is noteworthy that those citiesthat have shown great economic vigor over the last decade in India,such as Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune and Chandigarh exhibitcertain common characteristics.  They have an unusually largeendowment of educational institutions at all levels, and researchinstitutions. As it happens, a good number of relatively high technologypublic sector industries were also located in most of these cities. Withthe availability of such an educational and technical ethos, these citieshave a knowledge base that is significantly superior to that of othercities. Consequently, they have been able to lead the Indianinformation technology revolution and to benefit from all the higheconomic growth that has followed.  The lack of appropriate physicalinfrastructure and transport linkage inland or with rest of the world hasnot come in the way since the information technology exports are notdependent on these elements of infrastructure. All they needed wasappropriate communication infrastructure, which has indeed beenprovided progressively.  However, the prosperity brought by thesuccess of the IT industry in these cities has itself resulted in greaterpressures being placed on the existing infrastructure. Trafficcongestion has arisen due to much elevated levels of auto ownership;housing demand has escalated in both quantity and quality leading torapid increases in land and housing prices; and much increased powerdemand is putting great stress on existing power supply systems.Businesses are therefore beginning to look for other locations. Thecompetitiveness of these cities will therefore depend on acceleration inurban infrastructure investment and improvement in urban governanceand management.  The successful financing of such an enhanced levelof investment will depend crucially on the financial viability of suchprojects.Given that the level of Indian urbanisation is still less than 30 percent, and that 60 per cent of the Indian total population is stilldependent on agriculture, the continuation of high economic growth willdepend on the success of a higher rate of labour absorption by cities.This will need much higher growth in labour using manufacturing,higher levels of urban infrastructure investment, along with knowledgebased forward looking city management.  Thus, the Indian situation isquite different from that of China.  If Indian urbanisation does speed upas it surpasses the 30 per cent mark and as Indian per capita incomeapproaches US $1000, in normal circumstances we should expectacceleration in Indian urban growth.  This will need significantacceleration in urban infrastructure investment and hence in themobilisation of financial resources for such investment.   Although sofar India has not relied significantly on external savings for itsinvestment needs, it is possible that the demand for urbaninfrastructure investment will necessitate greater usage of externalsavings during this phase of India's urban growth.The other large country in Asia is Indonesia, which is spreadover a large number of islands.  Till the Asian financial crisis in 1997,Indonesia also exhibited economic policy characteristics similar tothose of other East-Asian countries in terms of openness and exportorientation, although it had more of a mix in economic policy, whichwas also concerned with promotion of import substituting industriesand conscious dispersal of economic activities beyond the naturalconcentration in Java.  Nevertheless, the greater Jakarta region, knownas the Jabotobek region, exhibited a high degree of urbanconcentration where a high proportion of Indonesian economicactivities got concentrated despite the large size and dispersed natureof the Indonesian archipelago.  Given the somewhat lower level ofIndonesian per capita income and the very rapid growth of theJabotobek region, the extent and proliferation of slums has been highin the region.(Webster, 2004)  Furthermore, Indonesia was perhaps themost highly affected of the Asian countries from the 1997 East Asianfinancial crisis.  It has still to fully recover from that shock and is yet toregain earlier economic dynamism. Thus the persistence of slums andthe accompanying urban distress is likely to persist in Indonesia longerthan its other South East Asian counterparts. The urban future ofIndonesia is more beset with uncertainties, reflecting the paralleleconomic uncertainties that it faces.How do we then look at Asia's evolving urban future over thenext 30-50 years?  How will it be different from the experience of thelast half century?  The one key difference is that with increasingglobalisation and ever higher levels of income that the region as awhole is now blessed with, the residents of Asian cities will now bemuch more demanding relative to their predecessors in terms of thequality of urban services that they deem to be their right and the urbanamenities of living that are now seen as normal.  Hence it is likely thaturban investment will be different in terms of its composition andintensity. Second, with increasing globalisation and reduction in tradeprotection, each Asian city will have to be more competitive on a globalscale than has been the case in the past.  In the larger countries therewill be inevitable tension between the claims of coastal urban areasthat possess natural comparative advantage and the vast hinterlandthat will need greater infrastructure investment for attainingcompetitiveness.  Hence, policy makers probably need to give greaterexplicit attention to the ingredients of competitiveness, thecorresponding public investment that will be appropriate in this regard,and the modes of financing that will need to be mobilised.  Third, asdiscussed, Asian urbanisation in the last half century has been baseddisproportionately on rapid city-based manufacturing growth in labourintensive industries that have pulled in labour from rural areas, therebyrelieving rural areas of excess labour and hence enabling growth inboth rural and urban productivity. With the changes in technology thathave now taken place it is an open question whether labour intensiveindustry will continue to survive and grow in the manner andexperience of the previous 50 years, and whether it will be as easy asin the past for urban areas to absorb the kind of rural urban migrationexperienced earlier.This issue is of great importance to India since the share ofmanufacturing in its economy is somewhat lower than could beexpected at its current level of economic development (Mohan, 2002).If India is not able to change its economic and urban specific policies toencourage labour using manufacturing in and around urbanconcentrations, and if the global economic imperative is that suchpatterns of industrialization are no longer feasible, how will its citiesgrow and absorb the large rural population that needs to get off thefarm so that both rural and urban productivity can grow faster? Thus,we can expect the pattern of Indian industrialization and urbanisation tobe different from that of East and South East Asian countries.It must still be understood that for successful and sustainableurbanisation the share of manufacturing will still need to increase, butwith somewhat different characteristics (Yusuf and Nabeshima, 2006).The manufacturing process has itself changed significantly so thatmany activities that were earlier concentrated in one location in oneplant are now often outsourced to many different locations within anurban concentration and even across borders. Often product design isnow increasingly information technology dependent and typicallylocationally divorced from the core manufacturing plant.  Moreover,product development and design is now increasingly being outsourcedon a global basis.  The availability of competent engineering skills at alower cost in India is contributing significantly to the relocation ofproduct development and design from developed countries to India(Marsh, 2006, a,b,c).  Conversely, Indian manufacturers are alsooutsourcing their product development and design in the reversedirection.  Second, increased global competition is also leading firms tolook for continuous reduction in core manufacturing costs in whateverways that are practical. Local outsourcing of components andprocesses is one of the common practices that has been found to beuseful in this regard. The requirements of inventory control andmanagement require the location of such outsourced manufacturingactivities to be in close proximity to the mother plants.  Thus,successful industralisation in this manner in India would increasinglyrequire greater concentration of these activities than has beenexperienced in the past. With the quality of manufactured goodsimproving all the time, it is becoming clear that the demand for lowskilled labour is unlikely to accelerate.  Hence, a core component ofeconomic and urban policy would have to be enhancement of skills ofthe labour force at all levels.  The provision of vocational training hasbeen difficult in most countries since successful training needs to bemarket determined; but the private sector often finds it difficult todesign an appropriate revenue model and public provision is typicallynot market sensitive. The need is for public private partnership, whichis not easy to design. Successful urbanisation in the future will becrucially dependent on the availability of labour with appropriate skills.Thus for Asian cities growing in the next 30 to 50 years it isbecoming increasingly clear that the key to their success will indeed liein the continuous enhancement of human resources.  In the globalizingworld, creativity and entrepreneurial dynamism will be the essence ofsuccessful cities (Yusuf and Nabeshima, 2006).  All the East-Asiancities, such as, Bangkok, Beijing, Singapore, China, Seoul, Tokyo andothers exhibit high levels of educational attainment, and haveimpressive endowments of educational and research institutions.  Infact, it is noteworthy that some of these cities, such as Hong Kong andSingapore, which did not traditionally have higher education institutionsthat were particularly noted for high quality, have in the last twodecades consciously invested intensively in higher educationinstitutions in terms of both quantity and quality.  Each of these majorAsian cities now houses large numbers of universities.  Illustratively,Tokyo has 113 universities and Beijing has 59 although, there is agreat deal of variation in the quality of these universities (Yusuf andNabeshima, 2006).  Similarly, in India, it is the southern region where alarge number of private colleges and universities have emerged tocater to the increasing demand from industry for technical personnel.Thus, apart from the traditional needs for physical urban infrastructureinvestment for successful urbanisation, similar attention now has to begiven to the soft infrastructure that is related to the creation, production,and retention of knowledge, along with facilities that enable continuousskill enhancement.Openness to the outside world does not just mean increase intrade in goods and services.  It also means greater openness to ideasand new practices.  In a recent conference on "Urban Dynamics in NewYork City" organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Yes,Central Banks are interested in city growth), Kenneth Jacksonattributed the great success of New York city to its openness to newwaves of immigrants over time.  "The constant infusion of new energyand ideas into the metropolis over the years enabled New York to meeteconomic and technological challenges that destroyed the prospects ofcompeting cities" (Jackson, 2005). It is quite remarkable that most ofthe successful East and South-East Asian cities have remained veryopen to the presence of foreign citizens with high levels of educationand skills.  There are said to be almost 100,000 foreign citizens inBeijing alone (Yusuf and Nabeshima, 2006). Such presence offoreigners contributes greatly to the economic vitality so needed bygrowing cities, as it provides new competition to residents, whilefacilitating the flow of new ideas in both directions.  In fact, a largenumber of universities and other technical institutions in the developedworld have also begun to realize that it would be increasingly efficientfor them to relocate some of their activities to Asian cities rather thandrawing Asian personnel to their parent campuses.  Thus,enhancement of human capital at different levels will evolve differentstrategies and increasingly greater openness to cross-border flow ofinstitutions and personnel.V. The Challenges of Urbanisation in the Twenty First CenturyOf the total projected increment to world urban populationbetween 2000 and 2030 of about 2.1 billion people about 1.3 billion orabout 60 per cent, will be in Asia (Table 1).  In the second half of thetwentieth century the total accretion to urban population in the worldwas similar in magnitude (about 2.1 billion), but the Asian share wassomewhat lower at about 53 per cent. As I have repeatedlyemphasized, it is this expected magnitude of urbanisation expected inAsia that is unprecedented and hence the management of it is the keychallenge facing us in all its multifaceted aspects.I have attempted to speculate about the possible changes inurbanisation patterns and requirements that may emerge in the future.Just as the structure of American cities is different from that ofEuropean cities depending on their vintage, we can expect the 21stcentury Asian city to also exhibit different characteristics. The olderEuropean or Asian city is typically more densely populated and lessspread out than the American cities, reflecting in particular the differentdegrees of motorization that existed at their inception. American citiesare much more dependent on privately owned motorized transportationthan cities in the older continents. Even as early as the early 1970s,nearly 80 per cent of US urban commuters traveled by car, ascompared with only 15 per cent in Japan.   In fact, 65-70 per cent ofTokyo commuters and 60 per cent of those in Seoul traveled by publictransit in the early 1970s (Mills and Ohta, 1976; Mills and Song, 1979).With increasing incomes and aspirations the pace of growth in autoownership in Asian cities is awesome as is the growth in trafficcongestion.The current increase in oil prices is sharpening the kind oftensions that are typical in debates related to urban transportation.With the emergence of increased private motorized transportation therehas been a noticeable intensification of investment in intra-urbanexpressways in many Asian cities. This typically leads to acceleratedurban sprawl, a still faster increase in auto ownership and consequentdemand for oil, and higher pollution. Over time, road traffic congestioninevitably catches up leading to further demand for road investment orfor mass transportation that is then expected to reduce road trafficcongestion and pollution. The current trends suggest that the result ishigh investment in both modes of transportation. Given the higherlevels of income that already exist, and expected rapid increase inincome growth, the emergence of these patterns is perhaps inevitable.The demand for both financial and physical resources will clearlyintensify, and the question is whether it will be possible for Asian citiesto impose appropriate taxation systems and user charges that canfinance the investments required.It is widely accepted that the current surge in oil prices is moredemand related than to disruption in supply as was the case earlier.With the expected pace of Asian urban growth over the next 30 yearsdo we then expect ever increasing oil price increases in response toever increasing demand? Or will there be corresponding supplyresponse, as has been the case in the past, which will contribute to oilprices falling again? In either case, appropriate petrol pricing and urbantransport pricing will be as crucial for urban policy as for economicpolicy as a whole. As is well known the emerging transportation patternalso affects city structure crucially: so urban transport policy will be ofgreat importance to the kind of growth that we observe in Asian cities inthe coming years.  Will the growing Asian cities be a new amalgam ofthe typical old densely populated city centre, co-existing with suburbansprawl characterised by motorized transportation modes, shoppingmalls akin to the American pattern.   In some Asian cities, the old citycentres are beign completely reconstructed as in Beijing and KualaLumpur, whereas in others the tension between the old and newcontinues.Another general issue affecting the pattern of urbanisation willbe the nature and pace of rural urban migration. In the case of China,because of the long standing one child policy, natural growth of urbanpopulation is low and hence the same rate of urban population growthgives rise to a much higher order of rural urban migration than in othercountries such as India where the natural rate of urban populationgrowth is higher. In the former, household size is presumably smallerand hence, for the same population size, investment in housing andassociated infrastructure will have to be higher per capita. Furthermore,the cultural problems associated with first generation migrants arelikely to be greater. Conversely, it is also possible that with highernatural urban population growth there could be greater local resistanceto in-migrants giving rise to associated problems in economic andsocial policy. Thus policy makers also need to give attention to thespecific nature of economic demographics in their respective countriesas it affects urbanisation.As the South East Asian countries urbanized fast in the 1970sand 1980s the problems of slums and associated deficiencies in urbaninfrastructure services related to water, sanitation, sewerage and solidwaste disposal received great attention. Because of the high economicgrowth these problems have taken care of themselves in manycountries. However, in still low income populous countries such asIndia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia the existence of slums andlack of services remain a serious issue. Given the large numbers ofpeople involved, issues related to change management are asimportant as those related to financing and resource management.Flexibility in urban land policy and zoning, the working of land markets,availability of housing finance, and facilitation of urban landdevelopment all need focused attention. The availability of sympatheticpolicy makers and professionals in these areas is at a premium inthese countries. Generating skills and professionalism in urbanmanagement in all its aspects will therefore be among the keychallenges that Asian urbanisation will bring in the coming years.One of the consequences of globalisation, more open trade inboth goods and services, and the vastly increased trans-border mobilityof the professional classes, has led to the prevalence of internationalcompensation levels for these groups despite lower average incomelevels in Asian cities, and hence to greater inequality in these cities.Members of these "creative classes" (Yusuf and Nabeshima, 2006)also seek an assortment of urban attributes that were not demandedearlier. They are much more demanding in terms of quality of housingand urban services, health and education services. Knowledge workersare also very interested in the availability of recreational amenities,cleanliness of environment, efficient and comfortable transportation,and international level communication services. Thus, in order to attractand retain the very people who are essential for city competitiveness,Asian cities will have to prematurely invest in world class facilities atmuch lower average income levels. The most competitive of Asiancities have clearly recognized this as is evident in cities such asShanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul, withBangkok fast attempting to catch up.The task for policy makers for managing Asian urbanisation inthe next thirty years is therefore more complex than in the previousfifty. In -addition to the traditional problems of providing, financing andmanaging basic physical infrastructure, they have to be moreconscious of the emerging demands resulting from globalisation interms of creating knowledge based cities that also boast of competitiveurban amenities. Increase in the sheer number of large cities over anycut off point, one million, five million, or ten million, will also stretch thecapability of government authorities of finding people with appropriateskills for city management. Here, it is perhaps correct to say that therehas been some decline in international attention to the generation ofsuch skills, and may well be an area for coordinated internationalattention.Finally, being a central banker, I can hardly conclude thisaddress without making some remarks on the financing needs of Asianurbanisation over the next thirty years.  Urban infrastructure typicallylasts for long periods of time.  Hence, while urban infrastructureinvestment has to be made ex-ante at the time of rapid urban growthover a period of 10-15 years, benefits may well flow for periods as longas fifty years or more.  Life would be easy if financing sources weresuch that civic authorities could raise resources in such a manner thatthe repayment schedule matched the benefit schedule.  A scan ofurban financing systems across the world does not reveal anyuniformity in pattern.   Germany has used its mortgage banks to sellPfandbrief bonds that enjoy high credit quality next only to the Bond,and then intermediate the funds to states and municipal authorities forinfrastructure investment.   There is a complex system of creditenhancements that makes it feasible to raise long term funds.  But thiscredit quality has been earned over more than a century over which themunicipal authorities have made sure that their tax and user chargessystems are such that they can redeem the resources raised.  In theUnited States, it is the decentralised municipal bond system that haslargely financed urban infrastructure.  Here also, since the ability toraise resources depends on the retention of healthy credit ratings,municipal authorities have a very strong incentive to stay solvent andservice their bond holders.  In principle, therefore, such systems havebeen successful since they have ensured that towns and cities face onincentive structure that encourages them to remain creditworthy andare essentially self-financing.In Asian countries, financial markets have not beensophisticated enough to allow for such financing methods yet.Financing for urban infrastructure has usually come for higher tiergovernments who raise resources from taxes, or from banks andfinancial institutions that have been typically government owned orsponsored.   Such systems are not well designed to avoid moralhazard: the recipient towns and cities do not have as strong anincentive to be essentially self financing.   The 1990s have seenincreasing attempts to privative the provision of urban infrastructure,but this has met limited success at best.  Given the magnitude of urbanpopulation accretion expected over the next thirty years, I see littlechoice.  If Asian cities are to thrive and prosper, they will have todevelop self sustaining local taxation and user charge systems so thatthey can tap national and international financial markets for theirfinancing needs.This brings me to the international dimension of urbaninfrastructure financing.  It is usually the case that, when a countrybegins its rapid urban growth phase its financial markets are yet todevelop, the only way to tap long term funds is to take recourse toexternal savings, which are then to be repaid over a long period oftime.  The typical historical experience has been that the regionsundergoing intensive urbanisation had to mobilise external savingsintensively; followed by periods of balance of payments crises and debtdefaults.  In Asia, too, the 1997 financial crisis was also partiallyreflective of large external resource flows earlier that suddenly gotreversed, as was the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s.  Sincethen, however, it is puzzling that the region as a whole is exhibitingfinancial surpluses that are being invested in Europe and NorthAmerica. In the great current debate on global imbalances, theassumption seems to be that these imbalances seem to be of a relativedurable nature, partly reflecting the favourable economic demographicsof Asia and the converse in the West.I remain somewhat puzzled by this financial turn of events. Iwould have expected that, the demands of infrastructure investment,particularly that of urban infrastructure, would be such that regionaldomestic savings will not be adequate to finance the requiredinvestment. Perhaps the explanation really lies in the Asian reaction tothe 1977 financial crisis and that we may expect higher investmentlevels in the years to come.  The magnitude of urban population growthexpected in China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladeshexpected over the next 30 years is such that pressures on internationalresource mobilization are bound to arise.  Urban infrastructureinvestment would then exceed available savings in these countries andthe current alleged savings glut will disappear over a period of time.Will there then be enhanced competition among Asian countries fromavailable international savings? With the emerging adversedemographics in the West, and hence low savings rates there, will thiscompetition lead to the emergence of higher real interest rates in theyears to come: the exact converse of the current situation of excessworld liquidity and low interest rates? If that happens, the task of urbanpolicy makers and central bankers alike will become that much moredifficult. The efficient intermediation of financial savings withincountries, and across countries, will therefore be as important for urbandevelopment as for financial market development per se and formonetary policy makers in the years to come.ReferencesDouglas, Mike (1998), "East Asian Urbanization: Patterns,Problems, and Prospects", The 1998 Walter H.
