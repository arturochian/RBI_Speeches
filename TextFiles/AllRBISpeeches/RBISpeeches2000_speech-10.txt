It gives me great pleasure in being with you, today, to share some thoughts relating tomoney and government securities market where the Reserve Bank of India has a pivotalrole to play not only as the debt manager to the Government but also as the monetaryauthority of the country. I am indeed thankful to Shri M.R.Ramesh for giving me thisAs all of you are aware, in order that the Central Bank conducts the monetarypolicy effectively with the help of market based instruments, a well developed money andgovernment securities market is an important  prerequisite. The effective presence ofsuch markets is felt, once a well- developed financial system is in place, wherein bothfinancial markets and financial institutions have important roles to play. As it is wellknown, the East Asian crisis is an outcome of the lack of well-developed money andcapital markets.Crises are part and parcel of the financial world we live in, resulting in financialstress not only in the respective market segments but also calls for dexterity on the part ofthe Central Bank, since it is the Central Bank that takes up the onus of such crisismanagement. Evidences suggest that during times of financial stress there is likely to be alarge demand for liquidity which only deep and liquid markets can provide. Let me at thisjuncture remind you that the Indian financial system went unscathed by the onset ofAsian crisis because of the cautious and gradual reform measures taken by the ReserveBank and Government of India.  We could also come out rather easily from the situationKargil incident.These instances would corroborate the inherent soundness of the policy decisionsthat the authorities have contemplated in the past.we were in a year ago during the opportunity to participate in this Seminar.Securities MarketCurrent Developments in Money and GovernmentBefore I touch upon the micro aspects in the development of Money andGovernment Securities Markets, let me briefly make a mention of the economicfundamentals.  The market analysis is now placing heavy reliance upon technicalities andthe  short term I think it has to focus on the fundamentalsin order to take a long term view.  Evidences show that in the recent years, the IndianEconomy has exhibited strong degree of resilience. Economic growth continued to bebuoyant and monetary conditions were supportive of growth.  The monetary policyefforts in ensuring availability of sufficient credit and softening of interest rates werefacilitated by general absence of inflationary pressures.  The external sector gained inIn the above context, I present before you the fact sheet. The overall economicperformance during 1999-2000 remained healthy with the GDP showing a growth of 6.4per cent. This compares favourably with the trend growth rate of 6.7 per cent during1995/96 - 1998/99 and 5.1 per cent during the period 1990/91-1994/95. This is in spite ofsome weaknesses in the agricultural growth. It is a welcome feature that growth rate ofindustrial sector is showing clear signs of revival from 3.7 per cent in 1998-99 to 7.5 percent in 1999-2000. On the price front, notwithstanding the year-end spurt, the low orderof inflation during the major part of 1999-2000 led to the decline in the average rate ofinflation (measured by WPI) on a weekly basis to a low of 3.3 per cent in 1999-2000 asagainst 5.9 per cent in 1998-99 and the average of 9.0 per cent during 1990/91 -1997/98.The inflation rate as measured by CPI also moved in tandem and reflected a steepdecline, as the average inflation rate for the year moved down to 3.4 per cent in 1999-2000 from 13.1 per cent in 1998-99. The external sector continued to be comfortable andthe resilience of the Indian economy was again demonstrated notwithstanding thesignificant increase in oil import payments. The current account deficit (CAD) wasrestricted to less than 1 per cent. Strong capital flows led by a turn-around in portfolioinflows, resulted in an overall balance of payments surplus for the fourth successive year.This enabled an increase in foreign exchange reserves by US $ 5.5 billion during 1999-2000 to US $ 38.00 billion by end-March, 2000. Net investments by FIIs was buoyantstrength with the enlargement of invisible surplus and capital flows.sentiments and taking a view on during 1999-2000 and resulted in a large net inflow of around Rs.10 ,000 crore as againsta net Financial markets in India remained relatively stable during 1999-2000. Therecovery of South East Asian market economies has had a favourable impact on domesticfinancial market conditions. Let me emphasise that a significant feature of the financialmarket activity during the nineties has been the growing inter linkages among the money,foreign exchange and government securities markets. Furthermore, according to theReport on Currency and Finance, 1998-99, there is an increased integration of differentsegments within short-term financial market which is reflected in the co-movement ofinterest rates.Let me now turn to the developments in the money and government securitiesmarket. The activity in the call money market is largely driven by the cash reserverequirements. Recent years have been witnessing a relatively higher level of activity inthe call market and this could partly be attributed to the evolution of a new institutionalchannel in the form of Primary Dealers. The average daily turnover in the recent period ismore than Rs.30 ,000 crore. The turnover and interest rates in the call money marketgenerally reflect varying liquidity conditions. The monthly average call rates for a greaterpart of fiscal 1999-2000 ruled in the range of 8-10 per cent. The pressure on call rateshowever continued during the month of June in the current fiscal and stabilisedafterwards.Among several recent developments, Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) hasreceived much attention. By now every one is familiar with the scheme and it hasstabilised.   It would be appropriate to continue with the scheme as originally envisaged.The scheme would eventually meet its ultimate objective of providing desirable quantumof liquidity according to the needs of the system with flexible rates and help impartgreater stability. Let me say that we have carefully noted all the suggestions received andshall address all the relevant issues taking into account the suggestions. One suggestion isadvancing the time of announcement of results.  Let me inform you, we shall announcethe LAF auction results by 12.30 p.m. and this measure would give the marketcrore during 1998-99. disinvestment of around Rs.800 participants sufficient time to assess their funds requirements and act appropriately. Weshall implement this with effect from Monday, July 31, 2000.Turning to the Government borrowing programme, in 1999-2000 Government'sprogramme was well managed without exerting an upward pressure on interestrates.  In fact, interest rates generally moved down during the year particularly at the longend of the market.  The debt management operations helped in moderating the interestrates and in influencing the maturity pattern of the debt issues towards medium to longduration. The borrowing cost to the government was stabilised at a relatively low level asreflected in the weighted average interest rate of 11.77 per cent as against 11.86 per centAs all of you are aware, the net market borrowing programme for the currentfiscal was budgeted at a Rs.76 ,383 crore. Considering the repayment obligations at,321 crore, the gross borrowing requirements of the Central Government  amount toRs.1,17,704 crore. So far, Government has raised an amount of Rs.56 ,683 crorerepresenting 48 per cent of the gross amount (budgeted). Our own assessment at thisstage is that the market borrowing would not overshoot this budgeted amount. On ourpart, we are quite confident of completing the Government's market borrowingA word on policy measures.  The monetary measures recently announced by theReserve Bank are warranted by technical factors to address  what are otherwise construedas transitory developments in the market. The fact is, even before these announcementsby RBI , there was an upward movement in the yields.  I would urge you to consider andrationalise all the developments contextually.  Any interpretation out of context will notbe helpful.  It is our endeavour to make our policy approaches more and more transparentand we welcome all comments and suggestions in this regard.On the question of short-term and long-term paper, let me say that the results ofsale of two securities of 6 and 10 year  yesterday i.e., on July 28, 2000 clearlymaturitiesprogramme without much difficulty.Rs.41in 1998-99.borrowing indicate the good appetite for the long term paper, as evidenced from the market interestfor the ten year paper.  There is demand for long-term paper by institutional investors likeLife Insurance Corporation (LIC), pension funds and we will continue to cater to thatdemand.  You would appreciate that in the ultimate analysis the investment decisions arerelated to economic logic and economic fundamentals. Our strategy will continue to be amix of auctions, tap sales, private placements and with issues of short-term and long-terminstruments.I may take this opportunity to flag another important issue which is critical for thefurther development of the Government securities market. This relates to thedevelopment of the retail market for Government securities.  A wider investor baseeventually would have a favourable impact on the cost of borrowing. Appreciating this,the Reserve Bank of India is engaging its attention for an appropriate policy approach todevelop this market. My colleague Mrs. Usha Thorat will deliberate on this issue indetail. I would appreciate if some concrete suggestions  emerge out of the deliberationsupgradation is a part of the reform of debt market.   RBI is planningto set up an Electronic Dealing System which will facilitate ( i) electronic bidding inauctions and (ii) dealing in Government securities and money market instrumentsamongst market players and also with RBI.  Such an electronic system will providetransparency on prices and volumes traded on real time basis to the market.  To facilitatesettlement in Government securities transactions, the dealing system will be linked tosecurities settlement system in PDO.  This will include screen based trade reportingsystem for settlement, supported by RBI's INFINET, located in this city of Hyderabad, ascommunication backbone.  This system will broaden the participation in the auctionThe Reserve Bank has taken on hand a comprehensive integrated project on PDOcomputerisation and negotiated dealing screen system.

The systems will reside at a main location termed as Central PDO atMumbai while regional  would have linkages with Central PDO thus acting asNow, on the issue of a modern settlement system, Governor made a mention inOctober 1999 and April 2000 on the need for setting up of a Clearing Corporation formoney and debt securities. It is expected that such a corporation, inter alia, would pavethe way for further opening up of the repo market to PSU bonds and bonds of financialdemat form in depositories.  The proposal to set up such a CorporationPDs and action to establish such a Corporation is being initiated.A “Core Group” has been set up to prepare the project report/indicate a road map andwork out all modalities for setting up of the Clearing Corporation for debt securities.  Tobegin with, the Clearing Corporation would be for settlement of all Governmentsecurities and other debt securities in demat form to facilitate repo transactions by all themarket participants as also for money market and forex settlement.  I may take thisopportunity to urge the PDAI  to speed up all the process of preparatory work so that wecan quickly move forward. The establishment of the Corporation will be another majorland mark in the institution building for development of markets.Primary Dealers have to play a significant role in stabilising the markets for  Governmentsecurities;  any measures by market players to contain volatility can greatly contribute tothe orderly development of markets.  As you are aware, from time to time adequatesupport has been extended by RBI to the PDs in their endeavours to play their roleeffectively in the Gilts market.  Increasingly they should be exploring new sources offunds. They should be playing a market-making role in the repo market.
