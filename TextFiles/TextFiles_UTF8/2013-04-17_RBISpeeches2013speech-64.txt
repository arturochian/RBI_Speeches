Seminar on   Strengthening IMF Surveillance  IMF Spring Meetings  Washington DC  April 16, 2013  ___________________________________________________________________    Question 1: Over the next three to five years, what do you see as the critical  issues for IMF Surveillance?    Response  There are several critical issues for IMF Surveillance over the next three to five  years. I want to focus on two of them.  (i) Is the IMF able to analyze and understand the growing complexity of  global linkages?  (ii) Does the IMF have an objective, unbiased and contestable view on  various aspects of Capital Account Management!    I will look at these issues from an Emerging Market (EM) perspective.    (i) Growing Complexity of Global Linkages     We are all agreed that global interlinkages have become stronger, more  complex and potentially more disruptive. The IMF needs to be ahead of  the intellectual curve in understanding these linkages.    Models used by IMF  Could not predict spillovers before crisis   So far research within and outside IMF has been focussed on trying to  understand linkages through trade, finance and confidence channels.  It is not clear that we have a clear understanding of the spillovers  through these channels. The spillovers predicted by the models that we  use are small relative to the reality of the large and pervasive spillovers  that we saw during the global financial crisis and are seeing through the  ongoing eurozone crisis. This clearly suggests that the assumptions  underlying these models are incomplete if not flawed. Greece, Cyprus,  Spain have had much greater impact on EMEs than we thought possible.      Among large emerging economies, India was by far the least integrated  into the global economy. Even so, India too was affected by the crisis by  much more than we thought.    Impact of QE on EMs   First, we all understand and admit that the extraordinary accommodative  monetary conditions in AEs is transmitting to EMs through capital  flows, exchange rates and global commodity prices.      The question is: Has this transmission channel become stronger now  than before because of: (i) the greater openness of EMs; (ii) the extent of  monetary easing in the AEs; (iii) the duration of QE; (iv) forward  guidance that QE will stay for an extended period. The question is, do  2 our models reflect this new reality or are we still working with the old  assumptions and coefficients? If we have not changed our models, are  we not likely to underestimate the impact of the spillover?    Non-tradeable Sector     Second, do we understand transmission of spillovers which originate in  the non-tradeable sector? After all, the global financial crisis had origins  in the housing sector, a quintessentially non-tradeable sector.    Global Supply Chains   Third, do we understand the working of the global supply chains  sufficiently? In an interconnected world, global supply chains can be  conduits for negative spillovers as in the case of the Japanese tsunami.      Does the IMF understand how global supply chains operate?    Deleveraging by Eurozone Banks     Fourth, financial developments in the euro area have given rise to  concerns that euro area banks could deleverage by reducing their  lending to emerging market economies. The recapitalization needs of  various euro area banking systems may also have an impact on credit  flows to EMEs. BIS data show that the cross-border bank lending to  emerging markets has dropped sharply since the second half of 2011 as  the euro area crisis intensified. Spillovers from both unwinding of QE  and amplification of euro area uncertainties, if they occur together,  3 would take on the dimension of a perfect storm for almost all members  of the IMF.      All these illustrations suggest that there is need to refine our  understanding of the interlinkages and spillovers.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    (ii) Capital Flows    The change in our world view on capital account management is by far  one of the most remarkable intellectual shifts brought on by the crisis.              Consensus Dissolved   In the pre-crisis period, there was consensus on several issues surrounding  capital account. Those consensus views have now dissolved.  (a)      Opening up of Capital Account   Pre-crisis: Consensus was that every country should move towards a fully  free capital account. The only questions were about timing and  sequencing.     Now we are not so sure.  - Argument: Capital Controls protected EMEs from adopting some of the  financial products that proved toxic in AEs.  4   - But there is the old argument that if countries are integrated economically,  can they remain separate financially?   - There are also questions on whether capital controls can ever be effective  permanently as interested parties can circumvent them.    (b)    Pre-crisis: Consensus was that capital controls are bad always and  everywhere.   Now we are not so sure.   New consensus: Capital controls are not only appropriate, but also  necessary.   But what type of controls and under what circumstances?   Are they a substitute for or a complement to macroprudential policies?   Price based or quantity based?   Asymmetric as between controlling inflows or outflows?    (c)    Pre-crisis: Consensus that foreign exchange intervention is sub-optimal.   Now we are not so sure with some AEs defending their currencies from  the safe haven impact.   New orthodoxy: There may be circumstances when foreign exchange  intervention is warranted.   When is intervention appropriate?  5  Is intervention symmetric between fighting currency appreciation and  fighting currency depreciation?      I believe the IMF management has issued a guidance note to its staff on  capital account issues. Whether IMF will be even handed, as between source and  recipient countries, on capital flows will be an important issue for surveillance on  the way forward.    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -     Question 2: How well do you think the IMF is now handling linkages and  spillovers in todays interconnected world, above all the Eurozone,  but also in relation to global imbalances?    Response   The IMF needs to put in greater effort at being even handed in both its policy  advice and in working towards its acceptance. This has to be done both at  country and global levels.      Let me cite two examples to illustrate this.      Currency Wars     Near consensus that one of the root causes for the global financial crisis was the  unsustainable build up of global imbalances. Concern that currency wars, by  preventing market based adjustment of exchange rates, may be aiding build up  of global imbalances.   6    Moscow G-20: We will refrain from competitive devaluation. We will not  target our exchange rates for competitive purposes, will resist all forms of  protectionism and keep our markets open.     Useful to summarize the arguments of both sides on the currency wars.      Arguments of Emerging Markets (EMs)    (i) Extraordinary surge in global liquidity because of quantitative easing by  advanced economies.    - This liquidity not absorbed in AEs. Spilling over into EMs.    - This is money looking for quick returns. Hence inherently volatile.     (ii) In the face of capital flows, we do not have any benign solution.    - If we dont intervene, appreciation of currencies unrelated to  fundamentals.     - If we intervene to stem appreciation, but do not sterilize, resultant  liquidity will lead to inflation and asset price bubbles which can  disrupt financial stability.    - If we sterilize the liquidity, interest rates go up attracting more  flows. A classic case of Dutch Disease.    - There is really no benign option.  7   (iii)Contrary to popular stereotype view, real effective exchange rates of EMEs  have indeed appreciated since the 2008 crisis.      (iv)        AEs must be more sensitive to the spillover impact of their policies.    - The burden of adjustment must be shared.     Arguments of Advanced Economies  (i) QE is driven by entirely domestic macroeconomic consideration of stimulating  demand.    - Currency depreciation is not an objective of easy monetary policy.    - If any depreciation of AE currencies has occurred, it is an incidental  by product of the policy.    (ii) There is no evidence that trade weighted exchange rates of EMEs, with some  exceptions, have appreciated relative to their values before the crisis.    (iii)EMs are attracting capital flows because of pull factors, not push factors.    (iv) Spillover of QE is in fact positive because if AE growth recovers, it will  provide a boost to EM exports and more than offset the impact of currency  appreciation. The net impact of QE is +ve for EMs.           8  Where does IMF Stand on Currency Wars?    (i) Does the IMF have an unbiased understanding of currency wars?    (ii) Is the IMF being even handed in its evaluation of countries forex intervention  and capital control policies?    (iii)Is the IMFs job done just by bringing out the spillover reports? Should it not go  beyond that to more assertively sensitize AEs to the spillover impact of their  policies? Should it not be more proactive in dissemination of its findings  and in urging action?    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    IMF needs to be more consultative    There has been a lot said and written about how the IMF economists must be  more open minded, less ideological, be bold enough to question orthodoxies  and brave enough to differ from established wisdom.     One important condition for this to happen is that IMF economists should talk  to people beyond governments and policy institutions.      In federal systems, they must talk to state governments.     They must talk to non-state actors such as NGOs, self help groups, chambers of  commerce.      9 Cyprus Bail out     In particular, they must understand how financial market participants will react  to their views and their policy advice. The initial Cyprus bail out was an  example. Media reported that the IMF was against the tax on insured  depositors but yet IMF let that go forward with damaging consequences as we  now know.     IMF should talk more to financial market participants - not just large banks but  other players - hedge funds, PE firms, AMCs etc.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -       Question 3:  How should the IMF tailor its advice to different economies across  the world? Is it doing a good job of this?    Response    I would like to emphasize two points here. First, how far is IMF advice based  on country-specific factors? Second, is the Funds surveillance even handed?       Viewed from these two standpoints, there is a lot of scope for improvement.  According to the IEO survey, authorities of many large emerging market  economies found that the surveillance process added little value and offered  very limited perspectives and that their advice failed to take into account  country-specific factors.      10  Advice by the Fund should stem from a complete understanding of not only  macroeconomic, but also social and political settings of a country.       Advice should be founded on hard evidence and driven by facts. Ideology  should not play any role in analysis of facts. The Fund also needs to exercise  extreme caution when it gives advice based on models. This is  because in many  cases even  small changes in model specifications, definitions of variables used,  and time periods used in estimation can lead to significant  differences in the  results. At times, models are also not amenable to country-specific factors.       The impact of IMF surveillance works primarily through debate with country  authorities and public dissemination of its findings that is expected to condition  market and public response to IMF advice, and thereby work indirectly on  policy making. More transparent and wider dissemination of balanced  surveillance analysis may be an important means to enhance the effectiveness  of surveillance.  The IMF must be open to criticism and advice.      Now let me come to the issue of even handedness, which, I believe, is necessary  to enhance the IMFs legitimacy in its role as a trusted advisor. Surveillance is  often believed to have less impact on large member countries relative to smaller  ones (in terms of size of GDP or population).  It is necessary to evaluate how  this issue has been addressed since the 2011 TSR so as to ensure even  handedness.  In a recent IEO report on Role of IMF as a Trusted Advisor, it  has been brought out that there is a perception among some country authorities  that the IMF is dominated by the interests of its largest shareholders. Surveys  11 have shown that about a third of country authorities and half of the mission  chiefs did not believe that the IMF has become more even handed since the  onset of the global crisis. Lack of even handedness can undermine the IMFs  ability to perform both its global watchdog and trusted advisor roles.  There is a  need to strike an optimum balance between these two objectives which will give  a boost to the IMFs credibility.      The issue of even handedness is inextricably woven into the IMFs governance  structure. Modernizing surveillance must flow from and cannot precede reforms  in governance. As governance reforms progressively reflect the changing global  economic realities, so also will the IMFs surveillance gain legitimacy,  incisiveness and traction. It is only by this that the IMFs surveillance will  remain meaningful and responsive to the rapidly evolving needs of an  integrated global economy.  12
