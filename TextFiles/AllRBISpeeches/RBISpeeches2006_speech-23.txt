Use of technology in the financial sector:????Significance of concerted effortsShri Arvind Sharma, Director, IDRBT, members of the Governing Council ofthe IDRBT, fellow bankers and distinguished guests,It gives me immense pleasure to be here with friends from the bankingfraternity. In fact, being here is part of my annual pilgrimage to the Institute forDevelopment and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT). At the outset, Iwould like to compliment the Governing Council, faculty and staff of theIDRBT for continuing with their mission with distinction.The foundation for large-scale induction of IT in the banking sector wasprovided by the recommendations of the committees headed by Dr. C.Rangarajan, in 1984 and 1989.  Subsequently, in 1994, the Reserve Bankconstituted a committee on ‘Technology Upgradation in the Banking Sector’.The committee made a number of recommendations covering paymentsystems including setting up of an autonomous centre for development andresearch in banking technology. The IDRBT was created as a sequel. TheInstitute has established and operates the INdian FInancial NETwork(INFINET), performs research in banking technology and providesconsultancy services apart from providing educational and training facilities forthe banking sector.In my remarks today, I would like to highlight the need for concertedefforts to enhance the use of technology in the financial sector to ensureefficiency, stability, competition and above all service to the common person.Technology and the RBII would like to enumerate for record a few technology-related initiativesof the RBI. First, the establishment of the mechanised cheque processingsystems using the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology inIndia. These have been acknowledged the world over as systems which havestabilised well with overall reject rates of around 1% while, I understand, that                                                          ? Address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Banking TechnologyAwards Function, 2006 at the Institute for Development and Research in BankingTechnology, Hyderabad on September 2, 20062the international rates are around 2%. Those who operate these systems,therefore, deserve to be complimented.Second, the technological infrastructure created by the IDRBT sincethe establishment of the INFINET in 1999. This was aimed at sharingexpensive IT resources so as to achieve the economies of scale. One of thenotable achievements of the IDRBT has been the implementation of PublicKey Infrastructure (PKI)-based electronic data transfer with very high securitylevels.Third, the introduction of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)System. It has not only resulted in compliance with the Core Principles forSystemically Important Payment Systems of the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS), Basle but has also paved the way for risk-free, credit push-based fund transfers settled on a real time basis and in the central bankmoney. We had an occasion to compare our RTGS system with other RTGSsystems for placing before our Board for Payment and Settlement Systems. Itemerged that the Indian RTGS system, which has the ‘Y’ topology, isconsidered to be the optimal choice and this topology has also been adoptedby several central banks, which have implemented RTGS. Our approachtowards intra-day liquidity and potential gridlock resolution follow internationalpatterns. An evaluation of the various components of the RTGS system vis-à-vis the critical evaluation parameters set by the Bank for InternationalSettlements, Basle indicates that we are close to the best on most of theparameters.The facility for inter-bank funds settlement through RTGS is availabletoday across more than 23,700 branches of banks spanning more than 500centres in the country. While it is reassuring to note that transactions withlarge aggregate value are being settled through the RTGS system, withaverage daily settlement amounting to more than Rs. 60,000 crore, there isstill scope for routing many more systemically important payments through theRTGS. For the purpose, enhancing the customer awareness at the user levelwould be an urgent imperative. It is essential that the RBI, banks and largeplayers in the market make concerted efforts in this regard so as to ensurethat all large-value customer payments across financial markets, which havesystemic implications, flow into the RTGS, such as payments in the equity and3debt markets. Once the system achieves a critical mass of usage by theparticipants, a tipping point would be reached and it should be possible for thefinancial regulators to consider making the RTGS as the preferred mode forspecified large-value transactions in the financial markets.Fourth, creation of electronic fund transfer systems. It is not necessarythat all the fund transactions are settled on a real time basis. It is, therefore,important to expand the reach of other electronic payment mechanisms forsmall-value customer transactions across the country. Towards this end, theReserve Bank implemented the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) System inthe mid nineties, which was later upgraded as the Special Electronic FundsTransfer (SEFT) System in 2003 and has now been further enhanced as theNational Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) System since November 2005.The NEFT system, an improved version of the EFT system, hasenhanced security features and facilitates retail funds movement with multipledaily settlements, which enable customers to receive funds within two hoursof the settlement. Today, the NEFT facility covers more than 5000 branchesof 32 banks spread across 200 centres. The Reserve Bank has taken up asits mission, the expansion of the reach of NEFT to cover all computerised /networked branches of banks as outlined in the Payment Systems Visiondocument.  The plan is to provide NEFT facilities initially at all the RTGScustomer-enabled branches and thereafter, extend the same to cover almostall the computerised branches of banks across the country.Finally, a major initiative, as far as funds movement is concerned, ischeque truncation. In order to improve efficiency and substantially reduce thetime taken for cheque processing, the Reserve Bank has initiated steps tointroduce a Cheque Truncation System (CTS). A pilot project is scheduled tocommence in the National Capital Region in Delhi by the end of this year.Over the years, the role of the Reserve Bank is changing in tune withthe increased levels of maturity of the markets and the financial system as awhole. The role of the Reserve Bank in future would be of a catalyst ofchange as detailed in the Financial Sector Technology Vision Documentpublished in 2005. In realising this vision, the need for shared efforts towardssetting up of world class IT systems will gain greater significance. As a firststep, the Reserve Bank has, through the IDRBT, facilitated the setting up the4National Financial Switch, which provides such an opportunity to the financialsector. I would urge the banks to make extensive use of this facility. IDRBT isalso revamping the entire INFINET structure in consultation with the users tomake it more efficient in tune with the international practices. Perhaps, aformal benchmarking of the functioning of our system with the globalstandards and practices may have to be done and the outcome placed in thepublic domain.Technology Challenges for the Banking SectorThe entire approach towards technology-based banking has shownsignificant improvement since the initiation of reforms in the 1990s. Thenumber of public sector banks which has migrated (or are in the process ofmigration) to Core Banking Systems (CBS), is an indication of the progress inthis regard. The unique feature of the CBS is that the concept of branch-based banking gives way to the bank-based banking treating the constituentas the customer not of a particular branch but of the bank as a whole. Today,21 public sector banks have embarked on the use of such systems and thenumber of CBS-enabled branches exceeds 14,000 as against 14 banks withabout 5000 CBS-branches a year ago. Some of the banks are reportedlyfacing teething troubles in this area but I trust every effort would be made tostabilise the system to the satisfaction of all customers. I would urge that anassessment of the efficiency of functioning of CBS in all the banks beattempted to facilitate necessary improvements.The commercial banks have to address various emerging challengesincluding those arising from large-scale IT deployment. These include theimpact of CBS, more scientific risk management, better asset-liabilitymanagement, ensuring effective anti money laundering measures, and thesecurity concerns relating to implementation of IT in banks.One issue, which often gets raised in any discussion on technologyimplementation, is the cost it entails. Products such as smart cards, whichmay not require significant initial capital costs and which can be easilyimplemented for a large customer base, hold the promise for the future.5Let me highlight some of the critical factors, which need to beadequately addressed while dealing with IT. Prime amongst them is the needto ensure appropriate security and integrity of the system. Security in ITsystems is only as effective as the weakest link and as financialintermediaries, the banks have to ensure that security features incorporated inIT systems are the best of the breed. With ever-evolving informationtechnology, the security concerns do not remain static and a system of anongoing critical review of the efficacy of security features and measuresneeds to be instituted. Integrity of the data processed and stored in ITsystems has to be ensured by the banks at all times and adequate back up,including real time replication, to the extent possible, provided for.Another major requirement relates to disaster recovery managementand the fail-safe business continuity plans. In today’s world, customerexpectations are high and ensuring uninterrupted availability of the ITresources, even in the event of a rather extreme contingency, assumessignificance. The banking community, therefore, needs to put in placeappropriate contingency plans and test their adequacy at regular intervals.While the Reserve Bank is providing a common system-widecommunications infrastructure, the ultimate objective should be for each bankto develop its own communications network so that the movement of fundswithin the banks is entirely managed through their own networks.  This willavoid excessive dependence on INFINET and improve the overall systemicefficiency.  Though a few banks have already done so, there is scope forfurther progress in this regard by others.There are several co-operative banks too in the system which extendbanking services and some of them also have relatively large-scaleoperations.  Perhaps, it is essential that the use of technology in the co-operative banking sector too is enhanced, as appropriate, to bring them closerto the level of the commercial banks.Technology and Financial InclusionWe have been highlighting the need for financial inclusion whichinvolves the provision of banking services to the vast multitude of populationso far excluded from such services. As far as increasing the scope and6coverage of financial inclusion is concerned, some of the challenges whichneed to be effectively addressed include lack of adequate infrastructure inrural areas, relatively low volumes of transactions, comparatively highertransaction costs, and other factors such as the literacy levels of targetcustomers.Technology offers an excellent tool to effectively address the abovechallenges. Lack of infrastructure is being addressed in a variety of innovativeways, leveraging technology. Some of these include use of computer systemswhich do not require uninterrupted electric power supply, networking usingradio frequency and other non-conventional methods, centralisation ofprocessing systems leading to lower processing costs, provision of home-grown customised systems such as the low cost, multi-lingual ATM developedby the IIT, Chennai - all of which provide an impetus towards greater financialinclusion.In South Africa, technology has been deployed to widen the financialinclusion with the introduction of MZANSI account, which is a card-based,limited-service, affordable savings account integrated with the merchant point-of-sale outlets, ATMs and even Post Office outlets. In Philippines, the card-based retail money movement system has won great acclaim. In India, theReserve Bank, along with the IDRBT, is working on the use of multi-application smart-card systems which can serve as a bank account and alsofunction as a store of electronic cash, as a data repository for essentialinformation relating to the card holder, with built-in security features such asbiometric identification, and which can also double up as an entitlementidentifier or as a social security card.It is gratifying to note from a NABARD report that a pilot project onsmart cards has already been launched with Sri Visakha Grameena Bank inAndhra Pradesh, which has been one of the front-runner banks in financingSelf Help Groups (SHGs). It is expected that with enhanced use of rural-oriented technology, the bank would be able to provide value addition toservices offered to the rural clients and further expand its outreach in asustainable manner. Banks could consider the feasibility of using smart cardsfor the ‘No Frills Accounts’ so as to help expand the coverage of the bankingservices and facilitate the garnering of the much-needed low-cost deposits.7Here again, the approach of sharing of IT resources would have much tocommend itself.Technology and the Government SectorIt would be appropriate to also outline certain aspects of application oftechnology to the Government business since RBI is the banker to the Centraland State Governments. If we scan the technology initiatives of the States, wefind a large divergence in technology absorption across the States. WhileStates like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are generally aheadof others in e-Governance, this is just beginning to happen in the States likeMadhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the North East. As far as CentralGovernment receipts are concerned, the Government's tax collectionprocesses underwent a metamorphosis with the introduction of Online TaxAccounting System (OLTAS) for direct taxes.  Enthused by the success ofOLTAS, the Central Board of Excise and Customs, in consultation with theReserve Bank, has introduced the EASIEST (Electronic Accounting System inExcise and Service Tax) project which envisages a comprehensive e-paymentmodule that can be utilised by the banks’ corporate customers. The pilotproject for this is in an advanced stage of completion. Acceptance by theGovernment of electronic challans, based on formats to be available on theirweb sites, would make the process tax-payer friendly. It would alsosubstantially reduce paper usage, provide for Straight Through Processingand obviate errors arising from the reconciliation process, wrong data entry,etc.Another significant initiative taken in this sector by the Reserve Bankwas the computerisation of State treasuries throughout the country. Afterdetailed examination of the various aspects, steps are now underway for theestablishment of electronic linkage amongst the State Treasuries numbering3022, agency banks, Finance Departments of the State Governments, Officeof the Accountant General and the Reserve Bank of India.  This will help inspeedier accounting of receipts and payments of the State Governmentdepartments, apart from serving as a road map for achieving end-to-endconnectivity amongst various accounting agencies involved.8 It needs to be noted in this context that while use of the state-of-the-arttechnology within the banking system is an asset, it also poses a challenge tothe conventional banker and government accountants due to increase in thespeed and complexity of transaction processing. The banks have to ensurethat all transactions conducted as agents of Government are secure from end-to-end and are retrievable at any point of time. A successful example of this isthe electronic import-licensing system of the Directorate General of ForeignTrade which has an electronic payment facility integrated with the IT systemsof the banks.I would like to take this opportunity to mention that at a recentconference of the State Finance Secretaries, the Finance Secretaries ofseveral State governments expressed the view that the technological baseand efficiency of services rendered by some of the banks handlingGovernment business needed to be improved significantly. Relationshipbanking encompassing both, lending with a social focus and operating as abanker to the Government, is valuable but if the quality of service in handlingGovernments’ transactions is not of high standards, some of the banks maynot be able to retain their Government business at the current levels.Concerted efforts are, therefore, required by the States and their respectivebankers in this regard.Technology and MarketsTechnology has played a significant role in improving the efficiency ofthe financial markets. The Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) has beenfunctioning well. The introduction of Order Matching NDS (NDS-OM), hashelped further in securing better price discovery, transparency in trading,reporting and electronic bidding at auctions. The NDS, implemented sinceFebruary 2002, provides a platform for screen-based trading in governmentsecurities to the member banks and primary dealers with a facility to strike on-line deals anonymously and, thus, experience more efficient price discovery.The process involves the reporting of deals to the Clearing Corporation ofIndia (CCIL) Ltd. which generates the settlement – gross for the securities andnet for the funds leg. At the end of the day, the settlement information istransmitted to the RBI for effecting the same in its books. The CCIL also acts9as the central counterparty for the trades by guaranteeing the delivery ofsecurities as well as funds.We are in the process of fully integrating the NDS settlements with theRTGS. In order to improve the functioning of the corporate bond market, aHigh Level Expert Committee on Corporate Bonds and Securitisation(Chairman: Dr. R.H. Patil) has suggested various measures to revitalise thecorporate bond market through setting up of trade reporting systems, tradingplatforms, auction platforms and clearing & settlement systems.  The tradereporting systems suggested for corporate bonds is on the lines of TradeReporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) of National Association ofSecurity Dealers (NASD) in the US. Such on-line real-time data disseminationwill help the participants in making efficient trading decisions and at the sametime, enable the regulators to obtain and monitor information on the markettrends.  These recommendations are under examination by the agenciesconcerned.Concluding RemarksThe basic objective of deployment of technology in the financial sectorshould be to progressively move away from paper-based transactions, whichinclude use of currency notes, cheques or challans, and to the extentpossible, switch over to electronic means using RTGS or NEFT or any otherelectronic mode.It is opportune that we are today recognising the valuable contributionsof the path breakers in the field of banking technology. The identification oftechnology leaders and their recognition in the form of Technology Awards isa pointer that we are capable of excelling in our respective fields. The awardsof today are not a destination but only mark a good beginning – of a moreexciting and challenging era ahead of us in our march towards atechnologically advanced and efficient, effective, progressive and inclusivefinancial system.I wish you all success in your future endeavours.Thank you.
