*Transforming Indian Banking: In Search of a Better TomorrowThe significant transformation of the banking industry in India is clearly evident from thechanges that have occurred in the financial markets, institutions and products. Whilederegulation has opened up new vistas for banks to augment revenues, it has entailedgreater competition and consequently greater risks. Cross-border flows and entry of newproducts, particularly derivative instruments, have impacted significantly on the domesticbanking sector, forcing banks to adjust the product mix, as also to effect rapid changes intheir processes and operations in order to remain competitive to the globalisedenvironment. These developments have facilitated greater choice for consumers, whohave become more discerning and demanding compelling banks to offer a broader rangeof products through diverse distribution channels. The traditional face of banks as merefinancial intermediaries has  since altered and risk management has emerged as theirdefining attribute.- Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2001-02, Reserve Bank of IndiaMr. Verghese, ladies and gentlemen,It gives me great pleasure to deliver the valedictory address at the Bank Eonomists’Conference (BECON) 2002. I would like to thank the Corporation Bank and the IndianBanks’ Association for giving me this opportunity. Over the years, the BECON hasevolved as an important forum for intensive discussions on both contemporary andfuturistic issues facing the Indian banking industry.  This forum has served as animportant platform for structured information-sharing among bankers, research analysts,credit rating agencies and other financial sector bodies.Currently, the most important factor shaping the world is globalisation. The benefits ofglobalisation have been well documented and are being increasingly recognised.Integration of domestic markets with international financial markets has been facilitatedby tremendous advancement in information and communications technology. But, suchan environment has also meant that a problem in one country can sometimes adverselyimpact one or more countries instantaneously, even if they are fundamentally strong.There is a growing realisation that the ability of countries to conduct business acrossnational borders and the ability to cope with the possible downside risks would depend,inter alia, on the soundness of the financial system.  This has consequently meant theadoption of a strong and transparent, prudential, regulatory, supervisory, technologicaland institutional framework in the financial sector on par with international bestpractices. All this necessitates a transformation: a transformation in the mindset, atransformation in the business processes and finally, a transformation in knowledgemanagement. This process is not a one shot affair; it needs to be appropriately phased inthe least disruptive manner. The subject of the Conference is, therefore, very timely andappropriate and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the organizers forthis theme.2As you would all appreciate, the banking and financial crises in recent years in emergingeconomies have demonstrated that, when things go wrong with the financial system, theycan result in a severe economic downturn. Furthermore, banking crises often imposesubstantial costs on the exchequer, the incidence of which is ultimately borne by thetaxpayer. The World Bank Annual Report (2002) has observed that the loss of US $1trillion in banking crises in the 1980s and 1990s is equal to the total flow of officialdevelopment assistance to developing countries from 1950s to the present date.  As aconsequence, the focus of financial market reform in many emerging economies has beentowards increasing efficiency while at the same time ensuring  stability in financialmarkets.From this perspective, financial sector reforms are essential in order to avoid such costs.It is, therefore, not surprising that financial market reform is at the forefront of publicpolicy debate in recent years. The burgeoning literature on endogenous growth theory hascome to recognize the crucial role of sound financial markets in promoting rapideconomic growth and ensuring financial stability. Indeed, it is by now widelydocumented that the structure of financial markets helps explain why some countriesremain poor, while others grow richer. Financial sector reform, through the developmentof an efficient financial system, is thus perceived as a key element in raising countries outof their ‘low level equilibrium trap’. As the World Bank Annual Report (2002) observes,‘a robust financial system is a precondition for a sound investment climate, growth andthe reduction of poverty’.Financial sector reforms were initiated in India a decade ago with a view to improvingefficiency in the process of financial intermediation, enhancing the effectiveness in theconduct of monetary policy and creating conditions for integration of the domesticfinancial sector with the global system.  The first phase of reforms was  guided by therecommendations of Narasimham Committee I. The approach was to ensure that ‘thefinancial services industry operates on the basis of operational flexibility and functionalautonomy with a view to enhancing efficiency, productivity and profitability’. Thesecond phase, guided by Narasimham Committee II, focused on strengthening thefoundations of the banking system and bringing about structural improvements. Whilethere may be some concern over the pace and sequencing of reforms in the financialsector vis-à-vis the real sector, you will agree with me when I say that we have traverseda considerable distance since 1991. Reforms in the financial sector and their beneficialimpact have been well documented and I will not attempt to repeat them here.  The textof the Governor’s inaugural address also covers at length important issues such asownership, corporate governance, regulatory and supervisory issues and the like. I alsosee from the schedule that you have held intensive discussions on important issues relatedto corporate governance, reform of the capital structure, (in the context of Basel IInorms), retail banking, risk management technology, and human resources development,among others.I would, therefore, like to sensitize this forum, where the intellectual elite of the bankingindustry is present, with certain important policy issues confronting the financial sector atthe present juncture. I believe they are critical in my opinion because they have important3ramifications for economic growth and for sustained profitability of the banking industry.These issues are at the forefront of policy discussions on Indian banking and would needto be pro-actively addressed, now.Interest Rate ScenarioThe first important issue that I would like to highlight relates to interest rates.As a result of interest rate deregulation, the interest rate structure of banks iscompetitively determined in the market, barring a few exceptions.  A major factor thathas influenced the trend in interest rates is the sustained decline in the inflation rate in therecent period.  Notwithstanding year-to-year fluctuations, there has been a distinctdownward drift in the inflation rate during the second half of the 1990s, which is now ataround half the level as compared with the first half of the 1990s. Both the popularmeasures of inflation -  the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and the Consumer Price Index(CPI) – have shown a definite fall in the recent period.  For example, the WPI on anaverage basis has declined from an average of about 10.5 per cent per annum between1990-91 to 1995-96 to about 5 per cent per annum over the last 5 years.  A similar trendcan be observed with regard to the Consumer Price Index for industrial workers. In thecurrent year so far, inflation as measured by variations in WPI, has remained benignaround 3 per cent despite the adverse effect of drought and uncertainty on account of oilprices. As the inflation rate has decelerated, it has also had a positive impact oninflationary expectations. This is clearly reflected in the downward trend in nominalinterest rates.For instance, the overnight call money rate has fallen sharply from about 13 percent in August 2000 to the current levels of 5.5 per cent. Similarly, the 91-day TreasuryBill rate declined from 10.5 per cent to 5.4 per cent and the 364-day Treasury Bill ratefrom 10.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent over the same period.The long-term interest rates too have declined. The yield on 10-Year governmentsecurities has declined from 11.5 per cent in August 2000 to the current levels of about6.3 per cent. Similarly, interest rates on corporate paper have fallen significantly. Forexample, the interest rate on 5-Year AAA rated corporate paper has declined from 12 percent in August 2000 to about 6.7 per cent currently.The banks have also reduced their deposit rates. The term deposit rates of public sectorbanks over one year maturity have declined from a range of 8-10 per cent in August 2000to 6-8 per cent now. This fall in the interest rates in the recent period has been inconsonance with the monetary policy stance of a soft and a flexible interest rate regime.Despite the fall in deposit rates, depositors have received positive real interest rates ofclose to 2 per cent in the second half of the 1990s, which is much higher than the realreturn on deposits during the first half of the 1990s.On the other hand, lending rates of banks have not come down as much.  While bankshave reduced their prime lending rates (PLRs) to some extent and are also extending sub-4PLR loans, effective lending rates continue to remain high (Table 1 and Graph 1).  It isestimated that the average lending rate of scheduled commercial banks has declined froma peak of about 17 per cent in 1995-96 to about 14 per cent by 2001-02.  Hence, whilenominal interest rates have come down, they have not fallen as much as the inflation rate.Consequently, the effective real lending rate continues to remain high.  This developmenthas adverse systemic implications, especially in a country like India where interest cost asa proportion of sales of corporates are much higher as compared to many emergingeconomies.Table 1 - Real Interest RatesYear Weighted Weighted Average Average Inflation Rate Real Interest RateEnded average average Cost of Cost of WPI Manufacturing CPI-IW Borrowers Central DepositorsMarch Lending interest rate Aggregate Time Price Govt.Rate of of Central Deposits DepositsSCBs Govt. of SCBs of SCBsSecurities1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9=(2-7) 10=(3-6) 11=(5-8)1990-91 15.0 11.4 8.1 10.6 10.3 8.4 4.6 6.6 1.1 6.01991-92 16.5 11.8 7.1 9.1 13.7 11.3 13.5 5.2 -1.9 -4.41992-93 16.8 12.5 7.7 9.6 10.1 10.9 9.6 5.9 2.4 0.01993-94 16.5 12.6 6.9 8.7 8.4 7.8 7.5 8.7 4.2 1.21994-95 16.1 11.9 6.4 7.0 12.5 12.2 10.1 3.9 -0.6 -3.11995-96 17.1 13.8 6.9 8.5 8.1 8.6 10.2 8.5 5.7 -1.71996-97 16.9 13.7 7.6 9.4 4.6 2.1 9.4 14.8 9.1 0.01997-98 16.3 12.0 7.3 8.8 4.4 2.9 6.8 13.4 7.6 2.01998-99 15.5 11.9 7.4 8.9 5.9 4.4 13.1 11.1 6.0 -4.21999-2000 15.0 11.8 7.1 8.6 3.3 2.7 3.4 12.3 8.5 5.22000-01 14.3 11.0 6.8 8.1 7.2 3.3 3.8 11.0 3.8 4.32001-02 13.9 9.4 7.0* 8.3* 3.6 1.8 4.3 12.1 5.8 4.0Average1990-91to 1995-96 16.3 12.3 7.2 8.9 10.5 9.9 10.4 6.5 1.8 -0.31996-97to 2001-02 15.3 11.6 7.2 8.7 4.8 2.9 6.8 12.5 6.8 1.9* Data are exclusive of RRBs and pertain to last  Friday of March.Source:(1) Statistical Tables Relating to Banks.(2) Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy.5*For borrowers: weighted average lending rate - inflation rate of manufacturing goodsFor Goverenment: weighted average yield - WPI inflation rateFor Depositors: average interest rate - CPI inflation rate@A cross country comparison of interest rate trends during the 1990s provides someinteresting insights (Table 2).  The average inflation rate in all these countries has comedown during the second half of that decade (1997-2001) as compared to the first half. Inline with this, the average money market interest rates and government securities yieldshave also come down in real terms in most countries. On the lending side, however,prime rates in some countries have not shown similar falls in real interest rates (UK,Germany, Japan, Thailand and Hungary).  Thus, the Indian experience of sticky reallending rates is not unique. But, preliminary estimates do show a high correlationbetween government securities yields and real lending rate in Japan, India and Germanyduring the 1990s as a whole.  Hence, the downward rigidity in lending rates in India ascompared with the government securities rates during the second half of the 1990s doesseem more surprising in this context. It would seem that changes in inflationaryexpectations take a little longer to adjust than inflation rates themselves. It would berational for interest rates to be related to inflationary expectations, and in particular long-term interest rates. Therefore, bank economists have an important role of informing themanagement of appropriate inflationary expectations so that interest rates can be adjustedmore systematically.Table 2 - Comparative Picture on International Real Interest RatesCountry / Money Long-term Prime rate Inflation GDPPeriod Average market Rate G-sec Yield Rate GrowthUnited States1991 to 1996 1.50 3.71 4.40 3.09 2.581997 to 2001 2.73 3.20 5.73 2.46 3.37United Kingdom1991 to 1996 4.05 5.30 4.25 3.25 1.921997 to 2001 3.40 2.77 3.46 2.57 2.766Germany1991 to 1996 3.63 4.09 9.04 2.85 3.201997 to 2001 1.99 3.17 7.75 1.57 1.75Japan1991 to 1996 2.00 2.78 3.57 1.16 1.741997 to 2001 0.09 1.40 2.07 0.13 0.69Korea1991 to 1996 7.50 7.21 3.16 5.99 7.351997 to 2001 4.79 5.85 6.74 3.82 4.31Thailand1991 to 1996 3.71 5.78 7.74 4.97 8.171997 to 2001 3.22 4.65 6.98 3.44 -0.20China1991 to 1996 Na na -2.09 12.32 11.611997 to 2001 Na na 6.28 0.23 7.93India1991 to 1996 3.43 na 6.57 10.52 5.411997 to 2001 3.40 5.87 7.62 5.08 6.14Hungary1991 to 1996 Na na 5.11 25.04 -1.631997 to 2001 Na na 4.13 12.29 4.52Source : International Financial Statistics, November 2002.Understandably, there are certain rigidities in the overall interest rate structure in theeconomy that constrain banks from reducing their lending rates. These have been welldocumented in the earlier monetary and credit policy statements of the RBI.Subsequently, interest rates on small savings have also moved down and there is acommitment from the Government to link these rates with market related rates. Therecovery environment has also improved. A related issue pertains to transparency inlending rates. Especially after the introduction of sub-PLR lending by banks, the spreadsbetween the minimum and maximum lending rates seem to have widened. The RBI ismaking efforts to publish on its website bank-wise information on the minimum andmaximum lending rates. Our own internal exercises reveal that the concept of PLR mayneed to be reviewed in the current context. Perhaps, bank economists may like to studythe international experience and come out with suggestions.Lending to Small and Medium EnterprisesThe problem arising out of high lending rates gets accentuated due to segmentation in thecredit market.  The large corporates are able to negotiate fine rates with banks and areable to bring down their overall interest costs.  In addition, the large corporates have theoption of accessing the international capital markets for funds. The burden of adjustmenthas, therefore, fallen on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which have limitedaccess to funds. The high interest rates paid by SMEs may not always be in accordancewith their risk profile.It is clear that at present the Indian banking system is not fully equipped to promotesmall-scale enterprises around the country.  The key issue is that banking institutionsmust be enabled to improve their credit assessment capabilities with regard to small-scaleenterprises so that they can distinguish adequately between good and bad credit.  Small-7scale must not be equated with high risk. If the inflation rate is as low as 3 per cent andthe interest rates charged to SMEs are much higher than normal good credit risk to large-sized industries, there is an implicit adverse selection in the credit appraisal process.Bank economists need to give focused attention to risk assessment to this sector so thatthere are no errors of high interest rate to low risk borrowers in the SME sector and vice-versa.The provision for Credit Information Bureaus and better exchange of information oncredit risk between banks and financial institutions is also necessary to enable theseinstitutions to recognise higher risk without excessive costs. Furthermore, the cost ofcredit assessment of small and medium enterprises can be reduced by a focusedrecognition of clusters of like small-scale industries that exist around the country. Suchfinancial assistance programmes also need to be devised to provide assistance to thoseindustries that are in the reserved list to enable them to expand and upgrade technology.This should be done both at the individual and group level.  The focus of many suchactivities can be on the basis of industrial clusters so that economies of scale can beachieved both in financial assistance and in technology upgradation.Very significant changes are also taking place in the agricultural sector.  We can see thebeginning of a much closer connection between primary producers, trade intermediaries,food processing entities, and eventual marketing of value added products. With the shareof unprocessed foods falling, the real growth area in the agricultural sector is in valueadded food products such as meat, poultry, fish vegetables, fruits and the like. There is anaccelerating move of consumers to basic processed foods. These trends need to be studiedcarefully so that supporting policy changes and investments can be made.  Banks shouldexplore the feasibility of expanding substantially lending to these activities.Apart from adequate quantum of credit at an affordable price, there are issues relating toprovision of high processing costs and the attendant cumbersome paper work. There arelessons to be learnt from the experience of the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Schemes and theLaghu Udhyami Credit Card Schemes to the agricultural and small entrepreneurborrowers. Surely, there is some scope for extending the benefits of hassle free creditfacilities through similar innovative methods to other borrowers requiring credit limits ofover Rs. 2 lakh also. It needs to be recognised that the SME sector has tremendousgrowth potential and accordingly pricing of loans to this sector should be atcommensurate rates. Thus, there is need for realignment of interest rates among varioussegments of the financial market.  As the financial market develops, ideally the interestrates on all types of debt instruments, both in the government and private sectors, and inthe credit market should align in a relatively narrow band, reflecting realistic risk premia.There have been some signals of industrial pick up during the last few months.  For thefour months from July to October 2002, on a point to point basis, the rise in index ofindustrial production (IIP) has been above 6 per cent.  A major contribution to the highgrowth rates has been the manufacturing sector.  In use-based classification also, thecapital goods sector has registered impressive growth rates of over 15 per cent and 12 percent in September and October 2002 respectively.  Most (14 out of 17) industry groups in8the index have shown positive growth rates.  The increase in non-food credit of scheduledcommercial banks during the current financial year also appears to be commensurate withthe IIP performance.Nevertheless, banks have shown a marked preference for investments in governmentsecurities instead of pursuing their core activity of lending to commercial sector.   At anaggregate level, the SLR holdings of banks are close to 39 per cent as compared to theregulatory prescription of 25 per cent. Even strong commercial banks seem to bevoluntarily adopting ‘narrow banking’ in a bid to minimize credit risk while increasingprofitability. Such large investments in government securities well beyond the statutoryrequirement reflect dissipation of banking knowledge capital with regard to creditappraisals.  The interest rate risk on investments in gilts need hardly be over emphasised.Further, the current focus of banks is bound to exact some heavy costs in terms ofefficiency and credit availability. There is a danger of the link between liquidity, credit,money and economic activity being severed in the long run as a result of continued over-investment in government securities as a substitute for bank financing to the commercialsector.At a time when the industry is showing signs of pick up, banks should make efforts toincrease commercial lending. The need of the hour is revival of the manufacturing sectorand financing of the new slew of activities allied to agricultural lending. Of course, thiswould require focused attention through specialised branches, sound credit appraisals,adoption of sophisticated risk management techniques, and better information sharing.The legal environment has also improved with the passing of the new act to regulatesecuritization and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest.Revival of Long-Term FinancingThe development finance institutions (DFIs) were set up in the 1950s to provide mediumand long-term finance to the private sector. Many of these institutions were sponsored bythe Government. DFIs were expected to resolve long-term credit shortages and to acquireand disseminate skills necessary to assess projects and banks creditworthiness. DFIs weretraditionally dependent on concessional sources of financing, guaranteed by Government.On the asset side, they were predominantly engaged in term lending with banks financingworking capital requirements. The post-reform period has altered the domain of theoperations of DFIs both on the liabilities and assets sides. While DFIs started competingfor funds at market rates of interest, their asset profile also shortened. On the other hand,banks have entered the domain of term lending. The current trend is of DFIs convertingthemselves into banks. In this context, the future of long-term lending acquires greatimportance. Finance theory suggests that banks can play an important role in corporate financing,especially in situations of asymmetric information, principal-agent problems, design ofincentive compatible contracts and corporate governance issues.  In their early stages ofdevelopment, corporates are likely to rely on bank finance for working capitalrequirements.  Bank financing is also likely to be predominant in an economy having a9less-sophisticated legal framework. Considerations of lower transaction costs, efficientrisk diversification, cost effective assessment, monitoring and renegotiation etc., is likelyto make firms more reliant on bank finance than on market based debt instruments.International evidence on industrialized countries indicates that since the early 1970s,banks have played an important role in corporate financing.  The benefits of a bank-basedfinancial system vis-à-vis a market-based system were clearly noticeable particularly inthe case of Japan, France and Italy.  During this period, bank financing was equallyimportant in other industrialised and developing countries, although equity finance hasgained momentum in recent years.This is a challenging area as financing of long-term projects involves commitment oflarge funds over long periods with the concomitant asset liability mismatches. The shiftfrom a fixed to a floating interest rate regime, development of corporate debt market,introduction of derivatives instruments and further enabling changes in the regulatory andlegal environment are likely to increase long-term financing by banks. Banks would needto think in terms of setting up special wings for term lending, development of consortiaand syndication, and cooperation in assessment of projects. These are areas for furtherexploration by bank economists.Non-Performing AssetsOne of the main constraints to the above issues that I have raised is the level of non-performing assets. As of March 31, 2002, the gross NPAs of scheduled commercial banksstood at Rs.71,000 crore, of which the NPAs of public sector banks constituted Rs.57,000crore. The absolute amount of NPAs continues to be a major drag on the performance ofbanks.  The large volume of NPAs reflects both an overhang of past dues and on-goingproblem of fresh accretion. As we move towards the international norm of 90 days forrecognition of loan impairment, there may be a temporary increase in crystalisation ofNPAs in the banking sector.  There is, therefore, a need to bring about improvements incredit administration and management of credit risk.  In this context, the CreditInformation Bureau (CIB) should help in improving credit decisions by providinginstitutional mechanism for sharing of credit information on borrowers and potentialborrowers among banks and financial institutions. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)modified the guidelines for compromise settlements of NPAs of the small sector toprovide a simplified, non-discretionary and non-discriminatory mechanism. Banks shouldwork out processes for settlement procedures and expedite quick recovery of NPAs. TheSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of SecurityInterest Act, 2002 should help in cleansing the balance sheet of banks by facilitatingforeclosure. The constitution of an Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) is anotherchannel to remove NPAs from the balance sheets of banks through the processes ofsecuritisation of assets.  The RBI has recently posted on its website the draft of thedirections on prudential norms proposed to be issued by it to securitisationcompanies/reconstruction companies.  I hope despite the Christmas spirit and theConference mood, experts would have studied the RBI proposals and sent theircomments.10Risk ManagementIn the current interest rate environment, banks are finding it more profitable to invest inGovernment Securities. In 2001-02, trading profits of public sector banks more thandoubled to Rs.5,999 crore from Rs.2,250 crore in 2000-01. The net profits of these banksduring these two years were Rs.4,317 crore and Rs.8,301 crore respectively and thisincludes an additional Rs.1,365 crore and Rs.1,547 crore from forex operations. The RBIhas been encouraging banks to be proactive in risk management. In this context, with aview to building up adequate reserves to guard against any possible reversal of interestrate environment in future, banks have been directed to maintain a certain level ofInvestment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR).  The Reserve Bank is also taking a number ofsteps to develop further the derivatives market.  As announced in the Mid-term review ofmonetary policy for 2002-03, a Working Group has been set up with representatives fromthe market to enlarge the avenues of managing interest rate risks for banks and otherfinancial intermediaries as well as corporates in the rupee derivatives market.Recently, the Reserve Bank has issued a guidance note on market risk management. Theguidance note delineates the minimum requirements for a bank including approval levelsand requirements for any exceptions, deviations or waivers. The note illustratively coversthe responsibilities of risk management with regard to market risk management,  theresponsibilities of risk taking unit,  the responsibilities of market risk manager, riskidentification, risk monitoring,  funding and liquidity, models of risk analysis, and  riskreporting.In a rapidly changing business environment, no business can afford to remain static. It iswell understood that risk-taking is an integral part of any business enterprise. It isimportant is that each bank needs to have in place the technical systems and managementprocesses necessary to not only identify the risks associated with its activities, but also toeffectively measure, monitor and control them. If Indian banks are to compete globally,the time is opportune for them to institute sound and robust risk management practices.ConclusionI have today highlighted the need to work towards reducing the real lending rates ofbanks. This would require concerted efforts on the part of the Government and the RBI inrespect of removing certain structural rigidities and by banks themselves throughimproving efficiency. I have also  focused on the need to increase credit to SMEs as alsolook into aspects of creating an enabling environment for  long-term financing. Reductionin NPA levels and appropriate risk management by banks would go a long way inimproving efficiency of banks and inculcating a sound credit culture.                                                       * Valedictory address delivered by Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at theBank Economists’ Conference 2002, at Bangalore on December 29, 2002.@ USA, UK, Germany, Japan, Korea, Thailand, China and  Hungary.
