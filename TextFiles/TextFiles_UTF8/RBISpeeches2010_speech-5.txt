1 Five Frontier Issues in Indian Banking   - Duvvuri Subbarao  ___________________________________________________________________       First of all, many thanks to the organizers of BANCON 2010 for inviting  me to inaugurate this conference. I understand this is a premier banking conference  on the annual calendar where the top managements of banks and their economists  brainstorm on current issues. The theme for this years conference Ideate, Innovate  and Inspire is thoughtful, imaginative, and most importantly, inspirational.     2. In the aftermath of the crisis, banks, banking and bankers are very much in  public consciousness. Bankers around the world are not only doing a lot of soul  searching, but are also reviewing their business models and work ethics. At the  same time, there are vigorous efforts internationally to reform banking regulation  reflecting the lessons of the crisis. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  (BCBS) has come out with several components of a new package - Basel III -  aimed at better guarding banks against systemic risks of the type that plunged the  world into the crisis. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is currently engaged in  addressing  issues relating to systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)  and resolution regimes, improving over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets,  developing macroprudential frameworks and expanding and refining the regulatory  perimeter (hedge funds, securitization, credit rating agencies).                                                    1  Inaugural Address by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at BANCON  2010 in Mumbai on December 3, 2010.   3. We in India have been spared the worst impact of the crisis. This should by  no means imply that we have no compulsion to reform. In a globalizing world, we  are vulnerable to instability anywhere in the global financial system. Indian banks  should, therefore, be adapting the best global practices in risk management to the  Indian context. Moreover, as a nation, we aspire to double digit and inclusive  growth. There are many challenges to achieving this including the challenge of  making our financial intermediation more efficient. This too presents a formidable  reform agenda for banks.     4. Given that overall scenario, I struggled hard to decide what I should say at  this inaugural session. I am quite impressed by the way the theme ideate, innovate  and inspire has been fleshed out, and by the depth and breadth of topics for  discussion in the follow-on sessions. After looking through the conference  programme, I determined that the best way I can add value to your deliberations  will be by putting across some of the important issues that should engage the  attention of Indian banks. I will present each issue, and on some of them I may  present a point of view. But I want to add that even as I may present a point of  view, all these issues are as yet open. My presenting a point of view is merely to  provide a reference frame for debate and discussion.      First Issue:  Are Indian Banks Prepared for Basel III?     5. The first issue that comes to mind, particularly in the background of the  recent global regulatory developments is: Are Indian banks prepared for Basel III?  The building blocks of Basel III are by now quite well known: higher and better  quality capital; an internationally harmonised leverage ratio to constrain excessive   2risk taking; capital buffers which would be built up in good times so that they can  be drawn down in times of stress; minimum global liquidity standards; and stronger  standards for supervision, public disclosure and risk management.     Capital  6. Our assessment is that at the aggregate level Indian banks will not have any  problem in adjusting to the new capital rules both in terms of quantum and quality.  A quick estimate of the capital ratios of the banking system after taking into  account the regulatory adjustments under Basel III is indicated in the table below.  This estimate, based on the data furnished by banks in their off-site returns, is  approximate. We expect to have a more accurate picture when banks review their  Basel III compliance position following the publication of the final Basel III rules  scheduled around the year end.        Parameter Basel III Actual value for Indian banks   requirement as on June 30, 2010       Under Basel II Under Basel III       Capital to risk weighted 10.5% 14.4% 11.7%   assets ratio (CRAR)    Of which                    Tier I capital  8.5% 10.0% 9.0%             Common equity 7.0%  8.5% 7.4%            37. As the numbers in the above table show, Indian banks are comfortably  placed in terms of compliance with the new capital rules. One point to note though  is that the comparative position is at the aggregate level; a few individual banks  may fall short of the Basel III norms and will have to augment their capital.   However as the phase-in time allowed is long enough, these banks should be able  to make a comfortable adjustment to the enhanced requirement.     Pro-cyclicality  8. The Basel III package includes capital buffers to contain the pro-cyclicality  of the financial sector. Building capital buffers will entail additional costs for banks  with consequent implications for investment and hence for overall growth. Apart  from the general concern in this regard, in India there is an additional concern  about the variable used to calibrate the countercyclical capital buffer. Credit to  GDP ratio is put forward as a natural candidate for this calibration. It is not clear  that this will be an appropriate indicator in the Indian context. Unlike in advanced  economies where this ratio is stable, in emerging economies such as India, it will  likely go up for structural reasons - enhanced credit intermediation owing to higher  growth as well as efforts at deepening financial inclusion. However, the proposed  framework is flexible enough to allow national discretion to suit the country  situation in a comply or explain framework. In India, for instance, sectoral  approaches to countercyclical policies have stood the test in the past and we could  continue with such sectoral approaches.     9. To effectively deploy countercyclical measures, we also need to improve  our capabilities to predict business cycles at the aggregate and sectoral levels, and   4identify them in real time. This will require better quality of economic and financial  data as well as improved analytical capabilities.    Leverage  10. Estimates show that the leverage in the Indian banking system is quite  moderate. Notwithstanding the fact that the SLR portfolio of our banks will be  included in computing the leverage ratio, Indian banks will not have a problem in  meeting the leverage ratio requirement since the Tier 1 capital of many Indian  banks is comfortable (more than 9%) and their derivatives portfolios are also not  very large.     Liquidity   11. The major challenge for Indian banks in implementing the liquidity  standards will be to develop the capability to collect the relevant data accurately  and granularly. We do not have much experience to fall back on since our financial  markets have not experienced the levels of stress that advanced country markets  have. Predicting the appropriate stress scenario is, therefore, going to be a complex  judgment call. On the positive side, most of our banks follow a retail business  model and their dependence on short term or overnight wholesale funding is  limited. They also have a large amount of liquid assets which should enable them to  meet the new standards.     12. There is an issue about the extent to which statutory holdings of SLR should  be reckoned in the estimation of the proposed liquidity ratios. An argument could  be made that they should not be counted at all as they are expected to be maintained  on an ongoing basis.  However, it would be reasonable to treat at least a part of the   5SLR holdings in calculating the liquidity ratio under stressed conditions,  particularly as these are government bonds against which the central bank provides  liquidity.    13. On the whole, our assessment is that Indian banks are well positioned to  adjust to the Basel III norms well within the phase-in period. That does not mean  there will be no challenges. There will be the challenge of upgrading risk  management systems and there will be the challenge of learning to make complex  judgement calls. Most importantly, there will be the challenge of meeting the credit  needs of a rapidly growing economy even while adjusting to a more demanding  regulatory regime. I trust you will ideate on these challenges in the course of this  conference.                                                                                                                                                    Second Issue:  Should Indian Banks Aim to Become Global?    14. The second issue I want to address is one that comes up frequently - that  Indian banks should aim to become global. Most people who put forward this view  have not thought through the costs and benefits analytically; they only see this as  an aspiration consistent with Indias growing international profile.    15. In its 1998 report, the Narasimham (II) Committee envisaged a three tier  structure for the Indian banking sector: 3 or 4 large banks having an international  presence on the top, 8-10 mid-sized banks, with a network of branches throughout  the country and engaged in universal banking, in the middle, and local banks and  regional rural banks operating in smaller regions forming the bottom layer.   However, the Indian banking system has not consolidated in the manner envisioned  by the Narasimham Committee.  The current structure is that India has 81   6scheduled commercial banks of which 26 are public sector banks, 21 are private  sector banks and 34 are foreign banks. Even a quick review would reveal that there  is no segmentation in the banking structure along the lines of Narasimham II.      16. A natural sequel to this issue of the envisaged structure of the Indian  banking system is the Reserve Banks position on bank consolidation. Our view on  bank consolidation is that the process should be market-driven, based on  profitability considerations and brought about through a process of mergers &  amalgamations (M&As).  The initiative for this has to come from the boards of the  banks concerned which have to make a decision based on a judgement of the  synergies involved in the business models and the compatibility of the business  cultures. The Reserve Banks role in the reorganisation of the banking system will  normally be only that of a facilitator.    17. It should be noted though that bank consolidation through mergers is not  always a totally benign option. On the positive side are a higher exposure threshold,  international acceptance and recognition, improved risk management and  improvement in financials due to economies of scale and scope. This can be  achieved both through organic and inorganic growth. On the negative side,  experience shows that consolidation would fail if there are no synergies in the  business models and there is no compatibility in the business cultures and  technology platforms of the merging banks.     18. Having given that broad brush position on bank consolidation, let me  address two specific questions: (i) can Indian banks aspire to global size?; and (ii)  should Indian banks aspire to global size?   7  19. On the first question, as per the current global league tables based on the  size of assets, our largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), together with its  subsidiaries, comes in at No.74 followed by ICICI Bank at No.145 and Bank of  Baroda at 188.  It is, therefore, unlikely that any of our banks will jump into the top  ten of the global league even after reasonable consolidation.     20. Then comes the next question of whether Indian banks should become  global. Opinion on this is divided. Those who argue that we must go global contend  that the issue is not so much the size of our banks in global rankings but of Indian  banks having a strong enough global presence. The main argument is that the  increasing global size and influence of Indian corporates warrant a corresponding  increase in the global footprint of Indian banks. The opposing view is that Indian  banks should look inwards rather than outwards, focus their efforts on financial  deepening at home rather than aspiring to global size.     21. It is possible to take a middle path and argue that looking outwards towards  increased global presence and looking inwards towards deeper financial penetration  are not mutually exclusive; it should be possible to aim for both.     22. With the onset of the global financial crisis, there has definitely been a  pause to the rapid expansion overseas of our banks. Nevertheless, notwithstanding  the risks involved, it will be opportune for some of our larger banks to be looking  out for opportunities for consolidation both organically and inorganically. They  should look out more actively in regions which hold out a promise of attractive  acquisitions.    8  23. The surmise, therefore, is that Indian banks should increase their global  footprint opportunistically even if they do not get to the top of the league table.    Third Issue:  Should We Mandate Foreign Banks to Come in Only as  Subsidiaries?    24. The next issue I want to address is whether we should mandate foreign  banks to come in only as subsidiaries.    25. The road map for the presence of foreign banks in India put out by the  Reserve Bank in 2005 allows foreign banks the option of coming in either as a  branch or as a subsidiary, but not both at the same time. Even so, all foreign banks  have so far opted to come in only in the branch mode. There are currently 34  foreign banks operating in India with a total of 315 branches and they account for  about 7.2 per cent of the total assets of scheduled commercial banks.     26. One of the big issues thrown up by the recent crisis is the systemic risk and  moral hazard associated with what have come to be called Systemically Important  Financial Institutions (SIFIs). The underbelly of the recent crisis was the failure of  SIFIs which, because of their size, complexity and interconnectedness, brought  enormous disruption to the global financial system. Among the issues presently  engaging the attention of the Financial Stability Board is improving the procedure  for orderly resolution of SIFIs in the event of stress. Two considerations are  particularly important. First, SIFIs must be able to continue to function at a  minimum level even in a period of stress, and second, their resolution should not  expose tax payers to loss. It is these potential constraints in the resolution of SIFIs   9that have triggered a vigorous debate on the form of presence of foreign banks -  branch or subsidiary.    27. The subsidiary form of presence provides several comforts to regulators.  First, managerial decisions in subsidiaries are mainly driven by local economic  conditions; second, there is a clear delineation of the capital of the domestic bank  from its parent bank which protects the interests of domestic depositors; third,  independent directors on the boards of the subsidiaries provide sufficient separation  between the bank and its owners to ensure that the board does not have unfettered  ability to lean in favour of the owners and against the interest of domestic  depositors, especially in times of stress; and finally, local incorporation affords  greater leverage to host country authorities than does a branch operation to ring- fence the operations of the bank.     28. But local incorporation of foreign banks is not without costs. A possible  downside risk is that foreign banks will dominate the domestic banking system.  This could have systemic implications during normal times which would amplify in  times of crisis. Many countries where foreign banks dominate have seen them  vigorously acquiring business at the expense of local banks in boom times but  retrenching their operations equally vigorously in times of stress. This has been the  experience in varying degrees of all emerging economies, including countries like  India where foreign banks are present only in the branch mode.     29. Post-crisis, we know that mandatory subsidiarization is not a sure fire  method of protecting domestic interests since foreign banks facing a crisis at home  could very well abandon their subsidiaries. A good illustration of this tendency is   10what we saw happen in the EU in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis. It was only  after very concerted effort that EU could pressurize or persuade foreign banks to  maintain support to their EU subsidiaries. Even so, credit supply was seriously  impaired.     30. On balance, the subsidiary mode has potential advantages over the branch  mode both from regulatory and resolution perspectives.  However, a number of  issues arise: (i) Should subsidiaries be given full national treatment by virtue of  their local incorporation? If not what should be the nature and extent of  restrictions? (ii) Should the subsidiary form of presence be mandated for all new  entrants or should it be selectively applied based on certain parameters? and (iii)  What approach should be adopted towards the existing branches of foreign banks   whether incentives should be provided to them to convert into subsidiaries? These  and other related questions will be debated in the discussion paper that the Reserve  Bank expects to put out shortly.    Fourth Issue: Why Do We Need to Rewrite Laws Governing the     Banking Sector?  31. The current statutory arrangement we have is a baffling plethora of laws  governing different segments of the banking industry. The nationalized banks are  governed by the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking)  Acts of 1970 and 1980. State Bank of India and its subsidiaries are governed by  their respective statutes. Private sector banks come under the purview of the  Companies Act, 1956 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Foreign banks which  have registered their documents with the registrar under Section 592 of the  Companies Act are also banking companies under the Banking Regulation Act.    11Certain provisions of the Banking Regulation Act have been made applicable to  public sector banks.  Similarly, some provisions of the RBI Act too are applicable  to nationalized banks, SBI and its subsidiaries, private sector banks and foreign  banks.     32. Notwithstanding this wide array of legislations of varying vintage, the  statutory arrangement has served the system well by helping maintain an orderly  banking system. The Banking Regulation Act has not only stood the test of time,  but several of its provisions such as the requirement of minimum paid up capital  and reserves, restrictions on payment of dividend, transfer of a percentage of profits  to reserves, maintenance of SLR, restrictions on connected lending, maintaining a  percentage of domestic liabilities as assets in India have all helped the Reserve  Bank in preventing crises and maintaining financial stability.     33. Needless to say, each of the statutes was crafted in a contemporaneous  setting reflecting the needs and concerns of the time; and almost all the statutes  have had to be amended from time to time to reflect changes in circumstances and  context.  There is a strong case for reviewing all the various legislations and  recasting them for a number of reasons. First, the fact that different banks are  governed by different laws has created in an uneven playing field and that needs to  be levelled to provide for fair competition. Second, a single, harmonized legislation  applicable to all banks will provide transparency, comprehensiveness and clarity.  Third, there is also a need to iron out inconsistencies between the primary laws  governing the banking sector and other laws applicable to the banking sector.  Illustratively, the procedure for combination of enterprises under the Competition   12(Amendment) Act, 2007 is inconsistent with the provisions of the Banking  Regulation Act dealing with amalgamation of banking companies.  Such  inconsistencies need to be removed while reviewing banking laws.      34. The need for revisiting the statutes has been buttressed by the experience of  the global financial crisis. The crisis has thrown up a number of areas requiring  significant legislative action either because there is no legislation or because the  prevailing legislation is inadequate. Illustratively, issues requiring legislative  attention include the orderly resolution of failing banks and financial institutions,  domestically as well as cross-border, home-host regulatory cooperation in  information sharing, convergence of Indian Accounting Standards with IFRS,  empowering RBI for consolidated supervision, supervision of financial  conglomerates, etc.    35. The task of rewriting the laws governing the banking sector should be  driven by several somewhat inter-related motivations. First, there is a compelling  need to integrate the various statutes governing different segments of the banking  industry and different dimensions of the banking business into a harmonized law to  provide clarity and transparency. The second motivation is to build provisions into  our banking sector legislative framework that reflect the lessons of the crisis,  acknowledge the dynamics and complexity of a globalized financial system, have a  futuristic perspective and aid maintenance of financial stability. Finally, revision of  banking sector laws should also be motivated by the recognition that the banking  sector has been and remains a critical instrumentality not only for accelerating  Indias growth but for making it inclusive.    13  36. The decision of the Finance Minister, as announced in the last budget, to set  up a Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission to rewrite and clean up the  financial sector laws to bring them in line with the requirements of the sector is  therefore very timely and very vital.     37. It is important, however, to recognize the bringing about changes in policy  or in the regulatory architecture cannot be the remit of a legislative reforms  commission. Such changes have to be debated and decided upon as a prelude to the  work of the commission so that the commission has a clear mandate on the policy  directions. In short, policy directions should drive the work of the legislative  reforms commission, not the other way round. That underscores why it is important  for all of us - the banks and the banking regulator - to deliberate on the policy  directives. I hope this conference will set the ball rolling by discussing the various  aspects of legislative changes required in the banking sector.     Fifth Issue: Where Do Indian Banks Stand on Efficiency Parameters?  38. The growth acceleration that we saw in India during 2003-08 is attributable  to a number of factors, both tangible and intangible. One of the less acknowledged  factors that drove this growth was the contribution of the financial sector by way of  larger and better quality of financial intermediation. Just one statistic will evidence  this - bank credit as a proportion of GDP rose from 29 per cent as at end March  2000 to 55 per cent by end March 2010.     39. The analysis in the Reserve Banks Report on Currency and Finance 2006- 08 shows that the Indian banking sector has recorded an impressive improvement   14in productivity over the last 15 years; many of the productivity/efficiency indicators  have moved closer to the global levels.  There has been a particularly discernible  improvement in banks operating efficiency in recent years owing to technology  upgradation and staff restructuring. It is noteworthy that operating efficiency  continued to improve even over the last 2-3 years despite the turbulence in the  global financial system. Importantly, the performance of public sector banks has  converged with that of new private sector and foreign banks. Even, more  importantly, contrary to popular perception, there is also no significant relationship  between ownership and efficiency - the most efficient banks straddle all three  segments - public sector banks, private sector banks and foreign banks.    40. Indian banks can justifiably be proud of this record of achievement. But  they cant rest on those laurels. To achieve our collective aspiration of double digit  and inclusive growth, we need to raise the level of national savings and channel  those savings into investment. This means banks need to raise the interest rates  offered to depositors and reduce the lending rates charged on borrowers - in other  words, reduce their intermediation costs, or in technical terminology, reduce the net  interest margin (NIM).    41. At the aggregate level, the net interest margin of the Indian banking system  has narrowed from 3 per cent in 1999/2000 to 2.5 per cent in 2009/10. There has  also been a significant improvement in terms of the standard supervisory  parameters: capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and systems  (CAMELS). Even so, the net interest margin of the Indian banking system is higher  than that in some of the other emerging market economies even after accounting for   15mandated social sector obligations such as priority sector lending and credit support  for the governments anti-poverty initiatives.    42. The efficiency gap between us and our peer group of countries is indicative  of the catch-up job we have to do. There are several ways of improving efficiency.  By far the most important task is to further improve operating efficiency on top of  what has already been achieved by optimizing operating costs i.e. non-interest  expenses including wages and salaries, transaction costs and provisioning expenses.  This will enable banks to lower lending rates while preserving their profitability.     43. Indian banks have typically posted higher earnings than those of other  leading Asian economies as measured by return on assets (RoA) and return on  equity (RoE). Even so, they are burdened by a higher operating cost ratio measured  in terms of non-interest expenses to total assets which impedes their pricing  efficiency and affects their ability to rationalise NIM in a competitive manner.  The  task for Indian banks clearly is to press on with efforts for sustainable reduction in  operating costs through productivity improvement and skill enhancement and by  leveraging of technology. Reduction in operating costs will also come through  nurturing asset quality, diligent loan restructuring of viable assets and reducing  non-performing loans through recovery or upgradation. The efficiency of some of  the larger banks in particular has to improve in line with their domestic peers and  relative to global standards.    44. While on the issue of efficiency, I am both troubled and intrigued by the  fact that our banks see financial inclusion as an obligation rather than as an   16opportunity. If pursued effectively, financial inclusion will provide banks access to  sizeable low cost funds as also opportunities for lending in the small volume  segment. The latter should be possible since the Reserve Bank has since  deregulated the interest rate that can be charged on small value loans. To gainfully  pursue financial inclusion, banks will need to constantly reinvent their business  models and design products and services demanded by a growing economy and one  that is growing through a rapid structural transformation.    Conclusion  45. Let me now summarize. I have raised the following five issues for further  deliberation at this conference:   (i) Are Indian Banks Prepared for Basel III?     (ii) Should Indian Banks Aim to Become Global?    (iii) Should We Mandate Foreign Banks to Come in Only as  Subsidiaries?     (iv) Why Do We Need to Rewrite Laws Governing the Banking Sector?     (v) Where Do Indian Banks Stand on Efficiency Parameters?    46. I must admit that this is by no means a comprehensive listing of frontier  issues in Indian banking. Indeed, in preparation for this talk, I asked my office for a  list of issues that I can raise. They gave me a first list of 50 issues and added for  good measure that they can expand it should I so desire. Just shows how much  banking reform is on the mind of the Reserve Bank. Needless to say, I had to be  quite ruthless in winnowing down to just five issues so that I do not overstay my   17welcome in this inaugural session. I will be happy to share with you other issues  and our thoughts on them when we meet formally and informally in due course.     47. After this inaugural session, you will go into specific topic sessions to  ideate, innovate and inspire. This theme is broad and deep, and encourages you to  reflect on the big picture. The financial crisis has taken a devastating toll on global  well-being and put the world economy back by several years. As we all know, in  India we have been relatively unscathed by the crisis. But note that this is true only  in relative terms. We should not forget that India too paid a heavy price as the crisis  interrupted our growth momentum and thereby the translation of that growth into  poverty reduction. We owe it to hundreds of millions of poor people in the country  to make up for lost time and get cracking on an action plan to make our aspiration  of double digit and inclusive growth a reality. Towards this endeavour, the banking  sector must ideate on what needs to be done, innovate strategies for converting  those ideas into action and inspire their staff to implement those strategies.     48. I wish you all the best as you get down to ideate, innovate and inspire over  the next two days and beyond.    18
