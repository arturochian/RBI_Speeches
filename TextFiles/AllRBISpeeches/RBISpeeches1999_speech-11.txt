Regulatory Regime in Financial Sector –Hyderabad, known also as a Bagya Nagar, is well known for housing some of the premierinstitutions of this country, of which Administrative Staff College of India occupies a prideof place. The city has become a trendsetter in the emerging thrust area of Indian economicresurgence, namely Information Technology. It has provided congenial functionalenvironment for many of global IT Giants, in the process earning the name of Cyberabad. Itis just the other day, precisely on 19th June , I had been in this great city for inaugurating theRBI's VSAT secured financial communication network which is designed to revolutionise thepayment systems framework in India. Again, I am proud to be back in this city to associateorganised to chart the future role and operations of theIt is in fitness of things that the College which is a premier institution in advancedconsultancy issues has been chosen as the venue for discussing thetransformatory role and future functional direction of the Indian Development FinancialInstitutions. The more important reason for RBI getting closely involved in this exercise isOn a perusal of the agenda for the day, I note that after the Key Note address by DrY.V.Reddy, an authority on Development Banking besides being one of my senior colleaguesin the Bank, the participants have been through three thematic and analytical sessions guidedby panels of luminaries from current day Indian financial world.In any fora where issues relating to financial sector reforms are discussed, the task will be leftincomplete without a reference to the contributions of the Architect of modern financialarchitecture i.e. Shri.M.Narasimham. I consider it as my foremost duty to pay my respects tohim before starting the material part of my paper. In the first part of my address, I shall,therefore, be covering the present status of Regulation and Supervision in India after theadvent of Financial Sector Reforms in the early nineties, before proceeding to sum up theissues relating to harmonisation arising out of the Day’s Seminar.Earlier developments – Pro-reform measuresMajor reforms and shift in focus in financial sector regulation & supervision started in Indiansystem in 1992 i.e. after acceptance of the recommendations of Narasimham Committee (I)on financial sector reforms and more rapidly after formation of Board for FinancialSupervision in November 1994. I would like to state that most of the recommendations of theCommittee had been implemented. I would like to list some of the important hereunder:• Reduction of pre-emptions like high level of Cash Reserve ratio (CRR) andStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) .  The pre-reform level of CRR, which was at 15 per centof NDTL plus incremental 10 per cent on NDTL over the level of 3 May 1991, has sincethbeen brought down to a low of 10 per cent from the fortnight beginning 8 May 1999. Theeffective rate would be still lower if the exemptions on foreign currency and inter bankliabilities from NDTL are reckoned. Similarly, the SLR has also been brought down from38.5 percent on domestic liabilities and 30 per cent on non resident liabilities in pre-reformdays to the statutory minimum of 25 per cent prescribed under the Banking Regulation Act,that Shri Narasimham, the luminary of financial reform is Chairman of this college.management, research and Development Financial Institutions (DFI) of this country.myself with this all-important Seminar Emerging Issues *1949.• Deregulation of Interest Rate both in respect of deposits and advances. Only savingdeposits and those for less than 15 days and loans upto Rs.2 ,00,000 are yet under• Adoption of prudential norms relating to capital adequacy, income recognition, assetclassification, provisioning standards for impaired assets, and classification and valuation ofinvestment portfolio almost on par with global best practices.One of the two main areas of divergence from international norms in this regard is oursticking to 2 quarter (+one month) default status for reckoning a borrowal account as NPA.Another area of divergence is in bringing down the time lag for classification of doubtfulcategory (which is to be brought down from 24 to 18 months by March 2001 and will begradually reduced to 12 months). These divergences have to be understood in the broadercontext of otherwise stringent Indian prudential system wherein,- collaterals are not to be reckoned while providing for substandard advances, (collateralsare an integral part of lending system for Indian banks, as banks' unsecured exposures cannotexceed 15% of their total credit outstanding)- non restoration to standard category for one year even in case of regular performance ofthe account subsequently,- - poor communication network and absence of on-line payment systems, etc.• Promotion of competition by licensing new banks in private sector.Though the number of banks newly licensed are only nine, they accounted, within a shortperiod of four years of their functioning, for around 4 percent of the total assets of the Indianbanking system as against 7 per cent by 26 old private banks and 8 per cent by 43 foreignbanks. The new banks have made a niche in the type of services offered, use of networkedtechnology, array of new products and provide a healthy competition to that of some of thewell established foreign banks. The banks promoted by the DFIs have further benefitted fromthe qualitative credit appraisal techniques of their parents enabling them to contain their NetNPLs around 1 per cent in 1997-98 and at less than 3 per cent (as against industry'sprovisional average of about 8 per cent) even in a difficult year like 1998-99 for Indianbanking industry.Laying down transparency and Disclosure standardsRBI achieved this by mandating disclosure of some of the essential strength indicators andperformance related parameters as part of the Notes on accounts in the Annual publishedaccounts of the banks. Some of the important items relate to disclosure of accountingpolicies, capital adequacy ratio separately under Tier I and II, percentage of governmentshareholding, percentage of net NPAs to net Advances, category-wise provisions towardsdepreciation, NPAs, extent of sub-ordinated debt, gross value of investments less cumulativedepreciation, income ratios, business and profit per employee.As a sequel to the recommendations of Narasimham committee (II), RBI has already advisedthe banks, effective from 31 March 2000, to disclose maturity pattern of loans and advances,investment securities, deposits & borrowings, foreign currency assets and liabilities,      elongated payment cycles for commercial and trade transactions administered interest rate regime. movement in NPAs, lending to sensitive sectors as defined from time to time. The list is evergrowing.Besides prescribing these disclosure standards, RBI has, at the instance of the BFS, publisheda consolidated account of status of non performing assets of individual banks from 1997-98onwards in its annual statutory report on Trend and Progress of Banking.The recommendations of Narasimham Committee (I) that remain still under consideration orpartially implemented essentially relate to structural aspects like, public ownership andautonomy of public sector banks, formation of asset reconstruction companies, etc.The reform process was reviewed by Narasimham Committee (II), and within a short periodof acceptance of the Report in August 1998, a large number of its recommendations havebeen implemented or taken up for implementation in stages.  The announcements in thisregard were made in the Mid Term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy in October 1998followed by another stream of measures adopted in the April 1999 Policy of the Bank. TheyAdoption of BIS Capital Adequacy standardsst• CRAR for banks and FIs increased to 9% from 1 April 1999st(3 banks had CRAR at less than the minimum level of 8 per cent as on 31 March 1998 andas many as 84 banks had CRAR of more than 10 per cent as on that date.

Those, where action is yet to be initiated for implementation,require assessment of the amendments to various enactments and an expert Group constitutedStrengthening of Financial SupervisionDuring the last 5 years, the Indian supervisory system has come of age under the close andincisive oversight of the Board for Financial Supervision. The BFS which is an off shoot of   by the Government as suggested by the Committee is already on the job.       are:      the recommendations of Narasimham Committee (I) and formed under the aegis of thecentral bank meets every month under the chairmanship of Governor. Its deliberations anddirections are guided by four non-official members drawn from the central board of directorsof the Bank and who are also experts in their respective fields of accounts, law, managementand socio economics. Members spend considerable time in deciding on all matters ofsupervisory concern and there has been all round improvement in the banks’ NPAmanagement, housekeeping and reconciliation of books and internal controls and inresponding to the new Asset Liability management prescriptions. Also the new off-sitesupervision system focuses on identifying the major risk areas in banks.  The following aresome of the salient policy directions of BFS and duly implemented by the Bank in financialsupervision area:RBI has put in place comprehensive Rating system based on CAMELS (CACS for foreignbanks) arrived from annual on-site examination findings and is ably supplemented bySystem monitoring and major fraud reporting at quarterly intervals by BFS combined withexhaustive guidelines for concurrent audit, internal audit / inspection and close board levelsupervision by Audit Committee of the Board in banks has brought down the level ofunreconciled inter branch accounting entries, arrears in balancing of books (a perennial bugbear in non computerised / non networked environment), and improved the efficiency level inhousekeeping areas, particularly in public sector banks which have a large branch network.Basle's Core principles for effective banking supervision have been accepted and steps arealready on to address the few gaps in the area of inter agency cooperation, consolidatedsupervision and risk management. A committee has already gone into the procedures forstreamlining licensing of new private banks and its recommendations are being finalised foradoption.You will thus notice that the Indian banking system has covered many milestones in a shortperiod of over last five years in implementation of the various measures aimed atstrengthening their prudential base and operational systems. With the adoption of ALM andRisk Management guidelines by them before end of March 2000, there will be a discernibleshift in their operational focus from mere solvency approach to hedging against all types ofrisks inherent in funded and non funded exposures, taking them in the process to suchefficiency levels on par with the financial systems of the developed countries.NBFCSA major thrust of RBI’s regulatory and supervisory policy over the last 3 years has been inthe area of non banking companies. Required legislative powers were acquired by RBI and aseparate department was formed for supervising NBFC segment of the financial system,Some of the land mark measures initiated by RBI in regulation and supervision of NBFCsare: Compulsory registration, higher entry norms of net owned funds initially pegged at Rs.25lakhs (since enhanced to Rs. 2 crores), stricter prudential norms, enhanced capital adequacystandards, rating, elimination of weak players from the arena of acceptance of publicdeposits, formation of self regulatory organisations and commissioned audits through  though small in size but sensitive in the context of investment climate.         technology driven quarterly off-site surveillance system. Banks   professional accountants at RBI's behest, etc.stCRAR levels which were 10 per cent as on 31 March 1998 have been enhanced to 12 or 15per cent according to the nature of operations and as per the level of regulatory compliance.Equipment Leasing / Hire Purchase Finance companies without credit rating or with rating atless than investment grade as well as Loan / Investment Companies are required to maintainCRAR at 15 per cent. Equipment Leasing / Hire Purchase Finance companies with minimumstinvestment grade rating are required to maintain CRAR at 12 per cent as on 31 March 1999.The Bank intends to raise the CRAR in respect of all types of NBFCs to a uniform level of 15per cent over a period.Similarly, the minimum level for maintenance liquid assets requirement has also beenstincreased from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent from 1 April 1999.Development Financial InstitutionsTill the year 1990 RBI had not taken upon itself the task of broad oversight of the operationsof DFIs.  As brought out in the RBI Discussion Paper, these institutions are not similar inregard to their ownership, role functions and statute under which they are established.  Themonitoring of the DFIs started after 1990 on the basis of the recommendations made by anIn-house group formed for the purpose. The monitoring work was limited to calling forprescribed returns on liabilities/assets, source and deployment of funds etc. on quarterly basisfrom the DFIs. It was mainly for obtaining a macro perspective data for the purpose ofMonetary and Credit policy, assessing the quality of assets of the financial system andimproving co-ordination between banks and DFIs.With the setting up of BFS the responsibility for prudential supervision of DFIs devolved onRBI from April 1995. Under the powers available to RBI in terms of provisions contained inSection 45N of the RBI Act, 1934 and more explicitly in terms of powers given to the BFS,the first on-site inspection of DFIs started in May 1995. Though the CAMELS approach isbeing adopted to start with for the on-site inspection assessment, it has been well recognisedthat the scope and coverage of such inspections would also have to take into accountdevelopmental, co-ordinating and supervisory roles of DFIs. The task of designing anenhanced off-site monitoring system and on-site supervisory model for regulation andsupervision over DFIs is already on hand.Year 2000 (Y2k) compliance measuresOne of the important supervisory issues relating to business continuity of the financial systempertains to resolving year 2000 compliance which is better known as Y2k issue. RBI hasspared no efforts in this regard. It had initiated measures for awareness, problemidentification, remediation and compliance in this area as far back in September 1997 on thelines of BIS guidelines. Contingency measures have been prescribed including testing of theplans. Disclosure of compliance efforts have been mandated for inclusion in annual reportsand later publishing in the media. While more than 70% of the banks have reported compliantby April 1999, remaining are committed to become compliant by June 1999. Penalenforcement measures like higher capital adequacy standards, denial of branch expansion,etc. have also been envisaged for the non compliant institutions.New regulatory and supervisory measures on the anvilRecently, I had the opportunity of visiting the regulatory institutions in USA along with               Special Secretary (Banking Division) Ministry of Finance. Our interaction with some of theregulatory agencies like FDIC provided us a detailed insight into the ways these regulatorsapproached resolution of problem credit and quick responses to triggers and failings in thedepository institutions. As a follow-up to the visit, RBI has constituted special task orientedin-house groups to examine the various regulatory and supervisory issues like,• Redefining the role of DICGC on the lines of FDIC which is entrusted with theresponsibility of Insuring deposits, assuming receivership of problem depository institutions,and supervision under the multi-regulatory dispensation practiced in USA. The modelenvisaged for DICGC in Indian context would be sans the FDIC’s supervisory function, andfocused on faster recovery of the troubled institution.• setting up of Credit Information Bureau,  supervisory enforcement measures for breachesof CRAR standards,• augment the regulation and reporting standards for overseas operations of Indian banks,• suspicious activity reporting in tandem with the provisions of Money Laundering• new look to on-site inspection procedures with orientation towards adoption of Risk• Skill upgradation of RBI supervisors particularly in handling the emerging ALM and riskmanagement areas, and understanding the risks and controls in computerised environment• Upgradation of off-site processing system incorporating the ALM returns and providingfor introduction of Returns for Consolidated SupervisionAn Expert Legal Group has been set up to look in to changes required in the  legislativeframework in  regard to certain important issues, such as penal provisions against directorsindulging in connected and related lendings , foreclosure and bankruptcy,  besides broad-basing of certain provisions designed to plug the existing lacunae as well as achieve moreclarity in banking related Acts. Once the legislative framework is put in place, it willstrengthen the arms of both banks and FIs which will help smoothen gradual switch over touniversal banking.We are also contemplating to put in a regulatory regime for stringent action against bankswhose level of CRAR falls below the prescribed minimum level and CAMELS rating slips toD, the lowest rating under the supervisory rating process evolved by the Bank. The directionsthat may be issued to such banks may include one or more severe restrictions like, freezingthe level of outstanding loans and advances, denial of branch expansion, hiving of nonprofitable business areas and locations, down-sizing of domestic and overseas branches,imposing of cuts in expenditure in non-productive areas of operation, disposal of non-performing assets, change of top management or the entire board of directors, insistence oninfusion of fresh capital for continuance of dominant ownership,  and also compulsory.To conclude ,While I have tried to illustrate the Central Bank's firm resolve in promoting the financialstability and transparency of the Indian banking system, I would at the same time like toemphasise that we would like to have the global norms tailored to suit Indian environment.We are constantly endeavoring to move towards international best practices in the arena ofprudential and disclosure standards but shall prescribe and enforce them in a phased but firmmergersmanagement systems on the model followed by Federal Reserve System,enactment,manner.With all the progress made, I believe that there is still a long way to go in financialsupervision. We have to improve the early warning systems, enhance the supervisor skill tocope up with new products, meet the challenges that may arise on wide acceptance ofE'Commerce and Internet banking practices, requirements of cross border processing andevolve acceptable and reciprocal inter-supervisory norms between home and host countryregulators. Technology and communications have shortened the geographical limits butenlarged supervisory gaps and the battle will go on for bridging the gaps, as in other parts ofthe world.Mr. Chairman, let me now move on to the second part of my speech where I am supposed toAs you are aware that, Reserve Bank constituted the Khan Working Group in December1997and the final Report was made available in May 1998.  In the meantime, the ReserveBank had the benefit of Second Narasimham Committee Report (April 1998) and hence wethought that it would be a prudent way to prepare a Discussion Paper which would containReserve Bank’s draft proposals for bringing out greater clarity in the respective roles ofbanks and DFIs for greater harmonization of facilities and obligations applicable to them.The deliberations of seminars held at Mumbai, and Delhi earlier and today at HyderabadFor the future financial system of India,  the Discussion  Paper  has  thrown open a number ofissues regarding harmonisation.  I must mention here that  we do not have any fixity of viewson any issue.  All we are interested is that  we  put in place a feasible and stable system.The draft proposals as contained in the Discussion Paper encompass three main issues, viz.(i) approach to universal banking, (ii) meeting the long term capital requirements of thecorporate sector and the (iii) future role of DFIs and RFIs.Approach to Universal BankingAs  rightly mentioned by many speakers, in India we have  some elements of universalbanking and there are no legal obstacles to such an approach.  The Banks are alreadyproviding a length of financial services such as investments, merchant banking, leasing andhire purchase and project financing either in-house or through the subsidiary route.Likewise, the DFIs are undertaking bank-like activities such as short-term non-projectlending and retail deposit taking either in-house or through subsidiary route.The question  is  how much more of it now, or how gradually or how fast we could move sothat this process is defined to be orderly.There is no universally accepted definition of universal banking. Universal banking must beevolved in future so that the banks and DFIs could reap all the beneficial effects.  However,before moving towards this, there should be enough capacities in both banks and DFIs to dealwith new types of risks, viz. market risk, credit risk, etc. and hence the need for putting inplace appropriate risk mitigation mechanism is to be recognized. :clearly  indicate that on many important issues, we are on  the same wave length.give a formal valedictory address.Capital Requirements of the Corporate SectorRegarding capital requirements of the corporate sector, the Discussion Paper clearlyrecognised the special role for DFIs and further stated that until the long term debt marketimproves, in terms of liquidity and depth, there is a special role for DFIs in the financialsystem. Large and medium-sized firms continue to depend on DFIs for long term financing.DFIs have acquired special skills in project appraisal, which banks are yet to fully specialise.During the last five years, i.e. 1993-94 to 1997-98, disbursements by All India DFIsamounted to Rs.1,86,075 crores compared to the incremental term loan from scheduledcommercial banks approximately at Rs.20,000 crore which formed only about 12 per cent ofAIFI disbursements.  This clearly indicates that the core competence of commercial banks lieoutside the area of project finance and term lending and for the time being at least they maynot be in a position to undertake long term financing in a significant way.Future role of DFIsRegarding Discussion Paper’s stance on the timing of transformation of a DFI into universalbank, it is important to recognise that the Discussion Paper’s approach clearly is to give theoption to DFI to convert or not to convert at all.  A DFI opting to convert may do so at anyIn the last 2/3 years, many corporates depended heavily on DFIs even for their equityrequirements.  It is doubtful, to what extent commercial banks would have been able to fillthe gap.  As rightly observed by many speakers, DFIs have a special role to play in thissphere.  This is also one of the reasons for suggesting a five year waiting period.  However, ifa DFI can demonstrate its capacities to transform into a bank sooner and conform to thetotality of regulatory framework of a bank, there should be no objection to suchtransformation.    … When a DFI chooses to transform itself into bank, the transitionaryarrangements, on a time-bound basis, could be worked out, after a detailed examination byThis is essential because each DFI would be in a unique position in terms of its capacity totransform into a bank, necessitating a transition period and tailor-made transition path wouldneed to be worked out.It is easier to enable DFIs to become full fledged banks if the reserve requirements such asCRR and SLR are drastically reduced – say to international levels.  One of the reasons forsuggesting a five year period as ideal is the expectation that fiscal consolidation would becomplete and would facilitate reduction in reserve requirements.  The recent budget ofGovernment of India clearly gives a medium-term commitment to reduce gross fiscal deficitof Centre to 2 per cent of GDP.  This is an important input to decide the timing of transitionof DFIs into full fledged banks.To sum up ,Mr. Chairman, let me express my observations on a few important issues before this Seminar.Although universal banking is a desirable one, we should be cautious in moving towards thisand a gradual and a well thought out  process is required.DFIs and banks have functioned  parallel to each other for decades and avoided overlaps,though more recently banks have gone into long term finance and DFIs have also beenthe RBI, on a case by case basis”.time without any stipulated time limit though five years appears “ideal”. :extending short term finance on a modest scale. The convergence therefore should be gradualand not appear to be dramatic or supplanting each other. In the mean time it is important thatvital issues like  making available long term funds at low cost, proper co-ordination betweenFIs and banks, a flexible and speedy approach towards rescheduling/rehabilitation of viableLet me assure you  that very detailed suggestions made here will be noted by us and reviewedinternally before finalising actions on the Discussion Paper.On behalf of RBI and on my own behalf I thank all the participants for valuable debate andShri  Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the s eminar on " Harmonising theRole of & Operations of Development Financial Institutions & Banks" (Sponsored by RBI at AdministrativeStaff College of India, Hyderabad)S.P.Talwar Address by * advice.projects are given immediate attention.
