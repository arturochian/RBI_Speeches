*Payment & Settlement Systems The Payment and Settlement System is an essential part of the financial system of a vibranteconomy. Consolidation, Development and Integration of the financial infrastructure andreforms in the payment and settlement systems of the country that address the twin issues ofsafety and efficiency have been engaging the attention of the Central Bankers and FinancialInstitutions the world over. Payment and Settlement Systems are no longer the backwaters ofeither the banks or the Central Banks.The Reserve Bank has taken up the mission critical approach to the establishment of anintegrated payment and settlement system in the country. A number of initiatives have eitheralready been implemented or are in an advanced stage on the drawing board. Identificationand classification of the Systemically Important Payment System (SIPS) have been done andvarious measures have been initiated to facilitate real time or near real time large value inter-bank funds transfer in secured environment.Recent Initiatives :(1) The PDO/NDS/SSS project, comprising inter alia the Negotiated Dealing System(NDS) is an initiative, which provides for an electronic platform for facilitating trading inGovernment Securities and Money Market Instruments. The System has been operational forover a year now and the manner in which you have used the System is laudable. We havebeen actively fine-tuning the PDO-NDS system, based on your feedback and we willcontinue to do so in the interest of the banking community. The Securities Settlement System(SSS) will, in the near future, provide on-line depository services for the GovernmentSecurities.(2) The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd., established at the behest of the Reserve Bank,has established itself as a Central Counterparty and is presently extending guaranteedsettlement for trades done in the Government Securities Market and the Forex market. Thenumber of products launched by CCIL in its short duration of existence speaks volumes ofboth the CCIL and the financial sector. The forex trading platform, offered by CCIL, fortaking care of the settlement of inter-bank rupee-US dollar deals, provides for a deep, liquidand transparent forex trading facility. This will help in improving market  efficiency andintegrity.(3) Special EFT has been introduced to facilitate funds settlement on T+0 basis thrice aday. This facility is available from 2500 bank branches located in 500 centres.(4) The Centralised Funds Management System is one such initiative, which provides fora Centralised Funds Enquiry System to the treasury branches of the banks in the first phaseand the Centralised Funds Transfer System in the second phase, allowing the banks to do anoptimal deployment of funds. I am sure that most of you have already been actively using thefunds enquiry module of CFMS as a platform for a having a bird’s eye view of your accountbalances at various RBI locations. Very shortly, you will be in a position to use this platformto do a near real time transfer of funds between your accounts in pursuance of your day-to-day funds management exercise.                                                * Inaugural address by Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Seminar onPayment and Settlement Systems organized by Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association ofIndia (FIMMDA) at Mumbai on May 6, 2003.2Real Time Gross Settlement System :The Real Time Gross Settlement System is the key critical element and provides the missinglink in the process of the setting up of the Integrated Payment and Settlement System in thecountry. The Real Time Gross Settlement System has now, the world over, been the preferredmode of the settlement of large value inter-bank payments, with more and more countriesmoving towards it. In the SAARC region, we are now being joined by Sri Lanka, which hasalso decided to move over to RTGS.RTGS, as a settlement process, minimizes settlement risks by settling individual payments inreal time in the books of account, held at the Central Bank. Under RTGS, the practicallyinstant settlement ensures fast, secure, final and irrevocable settlement of paymenttransactions.The Real Time Gross Settlement System on implementation will be a defining moment in thehistory of the Payment and Settlement Systems in the country. It will be, in fact, a significantstep towards the creation of an integrated, robust, safe, secure and modern Payment andSettlement System and I am sure all of you are looking forward to be part of the revolution.Let me apprise you of the roadmap for the implementation of the RTGS System. In June,2003, we will have a demonstrable RTGS package for testing and familiarization. It will belike an induction platform for the banks to the RTGS Standalone System, which will bedelivered in October, 2003. After completion of testing and acceptance, RTGS system willbecome operational before year-end.We have been building up awareness about the RTGS System. Already a series ofWorkshops and Seminars have been organized for your Treasury and IT Heads. We have alsoorganized a ‘Seminar on Liquidity Management in RTGS Environment’ to apprise you of thechallenges that you may face on the operationalisation of the RTGS System and the mannerin which you have to control and co-ordinate your liquidity management measures to deriveoptimal benefits from the RTGS System.It cannot be disputed that that the technological innovations, in general, have been at the coreof the reform process in the services sector globally and the financial sector, in particular. Forthe last so many decades, it has been driving the business re-engineering process in ourbanking industry. We, at the RBI, have been actively studying these developments andreadying ourselves to provide for a technology framework and operating environment,conducive to the banks. Let me share with you some of the initiatives that we haveundertaken.A reliable communication backbone to facilitate improvement in financial services, theReserve Bank of India has, through IDRBT, set up the INFINET – a ‘Closed User Group’network as the exclusive domain for the applications of the entities in the banking andfinancial sector. As you all know, the INFINET is a blend of VSAT technology and terrestrialleased line technology based Wide Area Network. INFINET provides for the robust andreliable communication backbone for the implementation of all the Systemically ImportantPayment System Applications.Reserve Bank’s concerns and focused attention on the twin issues of security over theINFINET and message standards for intra/inter-bank applications have led to thedevelopment and implementation of the Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS), astandard messaging protocol, which would be riding on the INFINET communicationbackbone. SFMS has adequate in-built security and with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI),provides for a security solution of international standards. SFMS will also act as analternative for accelerating the integration of the branches of the banks.3Secondly, a state-of-the-art, robust and secure platform – IBM S-390 System with a completestandby installation -- has been made operational in Mumbai centre to ensure the availabilityof the requisite technical infrastructure, capable of robustness, operational resilience andredundancies to ensure Business Continuity. The Disaster Recovery Site is being set up at ageographically distanced location from Mumbai.You will all agree that these efforts are incomplete without the total involvement andparticipation of the end-users of the payment and settlement system. The proverbial “lastmile” problems will have to be resolved. In order that the benefits, as conceived of under theIntegrated Payment Systems Architecture in the country, cascade down to the smallest branchof every bank and to every customer, you will have to be in an extremely high level ofpreparedness in terms of systems and operational processes, technology and humanresources, to make the most of these and the newer opportunities, arising due to the fastchanging canvas.In the area of Information Technology, specific attention will have to be paid to the TENCore Issues, which we have now been advocating for sometime. These are fundamental to theparticipation and realization of optimal advantages from the RTGS System round the corner.A Payment System Gateway as the Single Point of Interface with the INFINET forparticipation in the Systemically Important Payment System Applications :(a) Connectivity between the Payment System Gateway and the Primary Site andStandby Site of the RBI.(b) Computerisation of bank branches with Connectivity.(c) Setting up of intra-bank intra-city leased line network.(d) Connectivity with the Hub at each RBI site under the 21-centre Intercity LeasedLine Network of the INFINET.(e) Synchronous Systems across the bank – Hardware, Operating System andCommunication Platform.(f) IDRBT CA CPS, Implementation of PKI and Creation of Registration Authority.(g) Uniformity in Message Format for Inter/Intra bank Applications across the bankingsector and Implementation of SFMS.(h) Internal Applications of the bank and Interface with the RTGS System.(i) Development, Documentation and Implementation of the Information SystemsSecurity Policy in the bank.I am aware that quite a few of the above requirements have already been met by the majorityof the banks present here. I urge upon those, who have not yet met them or partially met themto do the same urgently. Most important and critical among these are the Connectivity andSecurity Issues. Unless all your branches are networked, the benefits of a secured and modernPayment System will not percolate to the end-users of the banking system i.e. the ordinarypublic. Further, unless the security features of the entire Transaction Cycle are enhanced tothe level of international standards (which is being sought to be achieved through theimplementation of the PKI and use of Digital Certificates), the common man will not reposehis full confidence in the Electronic System of Funds Transfer. That is why, the RBI has beenemphasing ‘Connectivity’ and ‘Security’ as the Core and Critical Pre-requisites, to be dulyaddressed by the banking sector for participation in the RTGS System.4The RTGS system will be a mode for large value inter-bank settlement, to be widely used, forenhancing your risk control measures, for faster and efficient settlement of your liabilities andfor better customer services for the ultimate users in the value chain. The success of thissystem will be one more step towards realizing our objectives of a modern, secure, resilientand Integrated Payment and Settlement System in the country. We are sure that all of us willbe partners in this step forward.
