First and foremost, I would like to thank respected Governor Dr. Subbarao, for  taking time out to inaugurate this conference. Sir, your keynote address today was  enlightening for its content which gave contours of the process of financial inclusion  and financial literacy in India. Financial inclusion is a national mission for India. Your  presentation today clearly reflected the commitment that you have towards the goals  of financial inclusion and financial literacy. In fact, you might perhaps be the only  Governor to have undertaken outreaches for financial inclusion and financial  education. Your examples of the challenges that still remain towards achieving  meaningful financial inclusion were indeed thought provoking. Sir, we are sure, that  your profound thoughts, and perspectives, will set off debate and discussion over the  next three days and will make this Conference a truly impactful event. Thank you very  much.   3. As the Governor so aptly put it, partnering with OECD and World Bank in hosting  this Conference is a valuable learning experience for India. These two institutions  have carried out work in the areas of financial education and financial inclusion which  serves as a benchmark for other entities to emulate. Ambassador Boucher, your  opening address today truly summed up coordinated initiatives that are being taken  globally for advancing the cause of financial literacy and education. Thank you very  much for partnering with us in the national agenda of financial literacy. I also thank  Mr. Onno Ruhl, India Country Director, the World Bank for his opening remarks highlighting the importance of financial education and the credible work done by the  World Bank in this area of financial inclusion. We sincerely hope that the partnership  with the OECD and the World Bank, we can make our financial literacy programme  sharper so that we can make rapid progress in our pursuit of financial inclusion and  financial literacy.     4. I also thank Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, for  steering us through the process of hosting this Conference and also agreeing to deliver  the welcome address. Sir, we thank you for your guidance and innovative thoughts.  Your address has clearly set out the essentials of effective financial inclusion and  financial education and given a succinct account of the efforts taken by the  Government, the Reserve Bank, other financial sector regulators and financial  institutions towards this cause. I thank all the delegates in this Conference for making  time to attend.   5.  I thank the distinguished invitees present here for attending the function with warm  enthusiasm. I thank all my colleagues from the Reserve Bank for their participation. I  also thank the media for covering this event.  6. It would not have been possible to hold an event of such scale and magnitude  without the wholehearted support and commitment of our colleagues in the Reserve  Bank of India, New Delhi office, ably led by the Regional Director. I thank them all  for their support.   Thank you all, once again.
