Remarks by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at  the Release Function of Dr. I.G. Patels Book Of Economics,  Policy and Development on July 16, 2012  _______________________________________________________    1. There are many privileges of being the Governor. Among them is releasing the books by  former Governors. It is a privilege to which I attach a lot of value, something which I  prize.    Newton    2. Because the occasion demands it, I must repeat what I said at the Reserve Banks  Platinum Jubilee.     3. Those of you who have had some exposure to the history of science would know that Sir  Isaac Newton was an intellectually arrogant man. When his friend and rival, Robert  Hooke wrote to him, applauding him for his law of gravity, Newton, for all his arrogance,  wrote back with uncharacteristic humility:    If I have been able to see a little further, it is because I am standing on  the shoulders of giants.    That is a statement I can relate to. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank in these  exciting times, I owe an intellectual debt of gratitude to all the extraordinary men who led  this great institution through several challenges, and made a mark in the economic history  of India. Among the most distinguished of them is Dr. I.G. Patel. I am proud and  privileged to be in the same lineage as him.        Special Occasion    4. I did not know Dr. Patel personally. He was already in the top echelons of the  Government when I joined the civil service; when he was the Governor of the Reserve  Bank I was a junior officer in the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Much to my loss, our  paths never crossed. This association with late Dr. Patel, of releasing his book,  posthumously - vicarious, as it may be - is therefore very special for me.    OUP  5. I want to thank Oxford University Press for giving me this privilege.    Ms. Alaknanda Patel    6. Those of you who have known Mrs. Alaknanda Patel will, of course, relive some  memories, through interaction with her today. Over the last few years, I have developed a  close friendship with her. I have always been impressed by her intelligence, charm,  vivaciousness; and have been touched by how much she loves all of us in the Reserve  Bank and the efforts she makes to maintain her bond with the Reserve Bank even after all  these years.   Alaknanda, your presence here means a lot to all of us in the Reserve Bank.  The Book    7. This book Of Economics, Policy and Development is a collection of largely  unpublished papers by Dr. Patel.   They cover a wide canvas  Money, finance, trade, balance of payments, economic development and  international political economy issues.      They cover a wide time span   2Articles written when he was a young economist at the IMF to articles and papers  written after Dr. Patel evolved as one of leading public intellectuals of the  country.      They span a vast intellectual spectrum  - Papers with deep academic orientation  - Articles with profound practical policy implications    What is common across all of the articles/papers regardless of the topic is deep  scholarship, sharp intellect and above all an abiding concern for public interest.    Ideas and Issues Resonate Even Today  8. What has struck me as I browsed through the book is that several of the ideas and issues  that Dr. Patel addressed resonate even in todays context, both at home and around the  world.   I will comment on some of the ideas that he raised.  ___________________________________________________________________     3  I. Monetary Policy  9. In one of the articles, Dr. Patel reviews the evolution of monetary policy in the post-war  years compared to the pre-war years. He writes:  [Quote] The supreme test of monetary policy lies in its ability to control the  supply of money in such a way that growth in prices is checked without retarding  the growth in production.[Unquote]    10. The essence of that sentence is that checking growth in prices without retarding  production; that is the quintessential growth versus inflation debate that is playing out  even today.     11. A relevant question in this context is the following:   To what extent is the Reserve Bank acting consistent with Dr. Patels  dictum of controlling prices without hurting production?    12. By far the most strident criticism against the Reserve Bank has been that even after  persistent and prolonged tightening of monetary policy - by raising interest rate 13 times -  we have not been able to restrain inflation. On the other hand, we stifled growth.    13. So the question is has the Reserve Bank failed in following the dictum that Dr. Patel  prescribed?    14. I dont believe so.  In fact I will argue that the Reserve Banks action is fully consistent with Dr. Patels  dictum of trying to protect growth with price stability.     15. Let me explain.   4 Inflation is inimical to growth. There cannot be much disagreement on that.      Low and stable inflation is an essential pre-condition for securing medium-term  growth. Only in a situation of price stability can consumers and investors make  informed decisions.      The Reserve Bank's monetary stance has been aimed at restraining demand and at  managing inflation expectations.     Admittedly, monetary tightening has resulted in some sacrifice of growth in the  short-term. That is an inevitable price to pay for price stability. But the sacrifice in  growth is only in the short-term. In the medium-term, there is no trade-off  between growth and inflation.      Philips Curve    16. Another facet of this growth-inflation debate that has played out in the recent period has  been the growth-inflation trade-off in the context of the Philips curve.   The argument is that we can raise growth by tolerating higher inflation. This is  misguided.      Relationship between growth and inflation is non-linear.     There is a threshold level of inflation.     Below the threshold, may be, there is a trade-off between growth and inflation.     Above the threshold, there is no trade-off between growth and inflation, higher  inflation actually leads to loss of growth. With WPI inflation at 7.25 per cent and  CPI inflation in double digits, we are way above the threshold.     What is the threshold level of inflation? That maybe around 5 per cent. Inflation  today is above the threshold.   5  17. Dr. Patels dictum about maintaining growth with price stability is the quintessential  objective of monetary policy.   That is something that we are deeply conscious of and that is something we are  adhering to in the Reserve Bank even today.       II. Communication Challenges    18. The second issue I want to talk about is communication challenges. There is a paper by  Dr. Patel and I quote a sentence from the paper:  Apart from communicating its own slant on national and international  trends, there are three special areas which need attention. The first is the  glamorous but elusive area of what the Central Bank communicates and  how it does so in relation to its specific responsibility for monetary and  foreign exchange policy; the second is communication on issues in  regard to its regulatory functions; and the last is communication with the  government of the day, including Parliament.    Oxymoron  19. I am deeply struck by this statement by Dr. Patel. Not so much by the content, not so  much by the context, but by the fact that Dr. Patel chose to say it at all. Because in the  time that Dr. Patel wrote this communication by central banks was an oxymoron.   20. As Dr. Patel himself admits:  I belong to an age when central bank governors, like children, were  supposed to be seen, not heard. Although they were allowed to smile in  public, they had to emulate Mona Lisa and maintain an aura of mystery.    21. How is the Reserve Bank today going to be evaluated on the basis of  Dr. Patels  exhortation to be more meaningfully communicative.    6  Alan Greenspan - the Doyen of Communication!   22. It would be blasphemous to speak about central bank communication without first paying  tribute to the doyen of communication - Alan Greenspan. So let me get on with it.    23. I will not of course tell you the joke about his marriage proposal to his future wife. Thats  hackneyed.    24. Greenspan is notoriously famous for transforming central bank communication to an art  form. In 1987 shortly after he took over as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, he said,  Since Ive become a central banker Ive learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I  seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.    25. After nearly 15 years on the job, in October 2001, Greenspan took a complete U turn  saying that, Openness is more than just useful in shaping better economic performance.  Openness is an obligation of a central bank in a free and democratic society.  Transparency of our activities is the means by which we make ourselves accountable to  our fellow citizens to aid them in judging whether we are worthy of that task.     IG Patel - Prescient    26. By commenting on communication, much before central bank communication became an  intellectually fashionable issue, Dr. Patel had been remarkably prescient.    27. Let me comment on contemporary perspectives on communication policy.         7Why is Central Bank Communication Important? 28.  Over the last two decades, central banks have moved towards clearer communication and  greater transparency. This has been driven by several motivations.    29. First and foremost, central banks have realized that open and transparent communication  enhances policy effectiveness by way of achieving expected outcomes. This shift in  central bank theology from deliberate obscurity to greater transparency actually reflects a  shift in the theory of monetary policy.     Robert Lucas    30. Up until the early 1990s, monetary policy was strongly influenced by Nobel Laureate  Robert Lucas argument that monetary policy affected real variables, like growth, only if  the policy changes were unanticipated. This encouraged obscurity over openness and  clarity. However, lost in the debate after Lucas' statement was the message that  monetary policy always affected nominal variables like inflation, even if fully  anticipated.     Two Nobel Laureates  31. In the 1980s, two economists, also Nobel winners, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott, argued  that fully transparent rules rather than discretionary policy were more efficient and  credible. This was the beginning of the push towards rules over discretion and greater  central bank transparency.         8Change in US Fed  32. The most eloquent illustration of this shift from obscurity towards transparency is the  change in the communication strategy of the US Fed. It is hard to imagine from todays  perspective, but prior to 1994, the US Fed did not disclose the  Fed Funds Rate; the  market was supposed to infer the rate from the timing, sequencing and magnitude of the  FED's open market operations.     33. In sharp contrast, today the Fed not only announces the rate but also gives a clear  indication of future policy trajectory.     Communication as Policy - Extended Period  34. Sometimes, communication, instead of being a vehicle for policy, becomes the policy  itself. Drawing yet again from the US experience during the crisis, the Fed realized that  its repeated announcement of keeping rates low for an extended period led markets to  reach a certain inference on what extended period could mean. In this context, some  policy analysts argued that a step that the Fed should modify the language of the  statement to communicate to investors that it anticipates keeping the target Federal Funds  rate low for a longer period than what the markets were factoring it to be. In fact, the Fed  did just that - by saying explicitly that the low interest rate regime will last into 2014,  much more specific that what the market wanted.    35. Yet another factor that has motivated central banks into placing larger emphasis on  communication is their hard earned autonomy in the years before the crisis. Central banks  have increasingly embraced more open communication to counter the criticism that an   9autonomous central bank comprising unelected decision makers was inconsistent with a  democratic structure.    Communication in Reserve Bank  36. In the Reserve Bank, we have tried to improve communication not only on monetary  policy but across the entire spectrum of our mandate. We have make efforts to demystify  the Reserve Bank.  37. We continue to make explicit efforts to improve the communication of the Reserve Bank.    (i) Streamlined the policy documents    (ii) Forward guidance - manage the risk that market does not ignore the conditionality  and interpret the guidance on an irrevocable commitment.    (iii)Post-policy press conferences and interviews    (iv) Teleconference with analysts    (v) Dissemination through our regional offices     (vi) On all areas, even extending beyond monetary policy, we put out Discussion  papers - New Bank licences - Most extensive communication exercise.    Dilemmas in Communication    38. It is not as if more communication is better communication. Even as central banks are  becoming more communicative, they are struggling with dilemmas:  (i)  What do we tell?  (ii)   How do we tell?   10(iii)  How much do we tell?  39. Dictum to central banks used to be what mothers across cultures and across time have  always told their children -  If you cant say anything nice, dont say anything at all.    40. But the drive for transparency has changed that. Now the dictum is: hold back  information only if it is absolutely necessary to hold it back.    41. It is a struggle that we fight every day.    42. For example , the Financial Stability Reports    - True picture of the financial sector  - But that could trigger a disruptive reaction and even panic  - A situation that could be managed and contained can implode  43. That is a challenge that we in the Reserve Bank contend with, not about what to disclose  but about how much to disclose and in what form to say it.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -                    11III. Responsibility of the Governor to Speak Up  44. I will now talk about the responsibility of the Governor. I quote from Dr. Patel:  But the point is, when such vital questions arise, the Governor cannot just be  inactive. He is a public servant with loyalty to the country and the Constitution -  not just to a government in transit. And yet, he cannot behave as if every issue is  of great import. He has to choose his ground and be discreet above all. Without  offending the government he can start a debate and steer the argument in a  certain direction. His ultimate defense is democracy and the tradition of free  debate.     45. In short what Dr. Patel said was, dont nitpick. Pick your battles. Once you have picked  your battles, fight those battles valiantly.    46. I want to pay a tribute to all my predecessor Governors who have followed this dictum.  Several important reform measures in the country and policy initiatives owe their origin  through the debates generated by the Governors. Of course, they are articulating the  institutional wisdom of the Reserve Bank.    47. Over the last four years we have tried to raise a number of issues in the public domain  because we believed that they needed to be debated:  - role and responsibility of the Reserve Bank for financial stability.    - the importance of protecting the independence of the central bank and indeed of  all regulators.    - the importance of being earnest about fiscal responsibility.    - setting exemplary standards for corporate governance.     1248. Government and the Reserve Bank are not adversaries. They share common goals. I think  some disagreement is natural. There are disagreements with the Government, there are  disagreements between the Government and regulators and public policy institutions. We  know that wisdom arises out of disagreement and debate. What we need is a wise  mechanism for distilling wisdom out of this disagreement.   49. Dr. Patel rightly says that the ultimate defence for the Governor and of course the  Reserve Bank is democracy and tradition of free debate.     50. Central banks render accountability  particularly important because central bank  officials are unelected and therefore have no electoral mandate. We take decisions that  affect the entire country. So we must be sensitive to render accountability for our actions  and the results of those actions.    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -                          13IV. Advising the Advisers  51. The final point I want to talk on is advising the advisers. There is a short piece in the  book, it is actually a book review that Dr. Patel wrote about Government advisers. That  struck a chord with me.    52. It is about role and responsibility of government economists and their influence on public  policy. Particularly important because Dr. Patel was among the first of economic advisers  in the Government.     53. Dictum to economists in government has always been: focus on objective analysis and  give competent, unbiased and professional advice. Do not worry about political  feasibility.     54. What struck me while reading this is that this is precisely the value system taught to civil  servants:    - Your job is to advise the political executive on policy and to implement that  policy diligently.    - You shouldnt be biased by politics  - Indeed you shouldnt be biased by any extraneous consideration  - Give your professional advice and let the political executive decide    55. With over 35 years experience as a civil servant, I am beginning to be sceptical about this  paradigm. Is it not too strait jacketed?     56. Should the civil servant limit himself to giving objective advice or should he also be  concerned about its feasibility?   14  57. If the civil servant suggests options that are totally infeasible, they are not adding value.  They are only making life more difficult for the political executive.     58. New theory - you give honest, dispassionate advice. But in doing so, be sensitive to the  democratic feasibility of the solution you suggest.     59. I am not saying that civil servants should be politicised or be less than honest. Only  saying that they should suggest practical, workable, democratically feasible solutions.       60. Question in the context of Dr. Patels piece is     - Is the code of conduct for government economists any different from that for  bureaucrats?    - In other words, should government economists also tailor their advice based on  feasibility, or leave that to be determined by the bureaucracy and the political  executives?                       15Conclusion  61. I have commented on a few issues raised by Dr. Patel  (i) the objective of monetary policy    (ii) communication challenges of central banks    (iii) responsibility of  the Governor to generate public debate on vital public policy  issues    (iv) the code of conduct for government advisers    62. These articles have been written over a long period -  (i) World has changed  (ii) World views have changed  (iii)India has changed  (iv) The Reserve Bank has changed  (v) Economics has changed    Value System    63. What has not changed in all this flux is the value system that must guide public servants.  64. It is that value system that Dr. I.G. Patel embodied in full.  65. The Reserve Bank is proud of the legacy left behind by Dr. Patel and is delighted to  renew its association with him through this book launch.   66. Congratulations to the editors  Dr. Deena Khatkhate  Dr. Y.V. Reddy  67. Thanks once again to Mrs. Patel and Oxford University Press for this opportunity.   16
