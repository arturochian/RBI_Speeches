1 Is There a New Normal for Inflation?  - Duvvuri Subbarao  __________________________________________________    India recovered from the global financial crisis ahead of most other countries, but  inflation too caught up with us sooner than elsewhere. As measured by the wholesale price index  (WPI), inflation went marginally into negative territory for a few months into the crisis in 2009  2 and started rising sharply thereafter, clocking a peak rate of 10.9 per cent in April 2010 .  Average WPI inflation was 9.6 per cent in fiscal year 2010/11, 8.9 per cent in 2011/12 and 7.5  per cent during the first ten months of 2012/13 (Chart-1).                                                               1  Speech delivered by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Bankers Club, New Delhi on March  8, 2013.  2  The last time India experienced more than three successive years of inflation above 7.5 per cent was during 1990- 96 New Normal Hypothesis  2. Despite this high episode of inflation playing out over the last three years, the Reserve  Bank has consistently maintained in all its policy reviews that its objective is to  condition  and contain perception of inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent. This is in line with the  medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with Indias broader integration into  the global economy.      3. In recent months, some analysts have questioned the Reserve Banks resolve to bring  inflation down to this level given the trend of stubborn and persistent inflation. Their main  contention is that average WPI inflation over the last three years for which data are available  (February 2010 - January 2013), at 8.8 per cent, is significantly higher than the average inflation  of 6.0 per cent in the three years before the Lehman collapse (September 2005 - August 2008)  suggesting that Indias inflation rate has undergone an upward phase shift owing to a host of  domestic and global developments. Monetary policy calibration, it is argued, can get flawed  unless the Reserve Bank acknowledges this new normal.    4. The Reserve Bank does not agree with this new normal argument. Indeed it is this  intellectual conviction that informed our efforts to rein in inflation over the last three years as we  brought inflation from double digit levels to below 7 per cent. The central task of this speech is  to present the Reserve Banks position on the new normal debate.     2   Arguments in Support of a New Normal  5. In order to make my case, let me first summarize the arguments put forward by various  analysts in support of a new normal.    (i) Wage-Price Spiral is a Permanent Shock to the Inflation Path  6. The first argument for a new normal stems from the steep increase in rural wages over  the last few years that has set off a wage-price spiral. Nominal rural wages increased at double  digit rates over the last five years. Indeed they increased so rapidly that despite high retail  inflation, real wages too surged at close to double digits in the last three years (Table-1).     Table 1: Increase in Rural Wages       Year Nominal Wage  Average CPI (RL) Real Wage   Increase* Inflation Increase     (Per cent)       2007-08   8.9   7.2   1.5  2008-09  15.9 10.2   5.1  2009-10  18.0 13.8   3.8  2010-11  20.0 10.0   8.9  2011-12  19.9   8.3 10.6  2012-13 18.1   9.4   8.0  (Apr-Dec)             * Daily wage rate for rural unskilled labourer (male)   Source: Labour Bureau, Shimla     7. By far the most dominant driver of rural wages has been the Governments affirmative  action programmes, both by way of transfer payments (subsidies) and welfare programmes,  3   which have significantly raised the demand for wage goods while also restraining supply of  labour at low wages. Two other factors exacerbated the wage-price spiral. First, the large public  employment programme has not only pushed up wages, but also exerted upward pressure on  agricultural input prices and thereby on food prices. Second, even as wages have increased, there  has been no corresponding increase in productivity - a recipe for inflation.    8. The new normal argument drawing from this is that it will be politically difficult to  reverse these entitlement programmes, they  are here to stay, and that India should accept wage- price pressures as a structural feature and adjust its inflation goal accordingly.    (ii) Commodity Price Pressures will Persist  9. Given the tepid recovery of advanced economies from the crisis and consequent sluggish  demand, the expectation was that global prices of commodities, especially of crude, would  remain soft. On the contrary, commodity prices have surged compared to the pre-crisis period  (excluding the highly volatile two years of the crisis) and have remained firm at that level (Chart  - 2).  4      Source: IMF and PPAC, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas    10. Several forces that will extend into the medium-term, it is argued, will work to keep  commodity prices firm. First, oil producers, notwithstanding assurances to the contrary, will  calibrate supply to ensure a minimum floor price for crude. Second, financialization of  commodities, a catch phrase used to describe a spike in commodity prices quite unrelated to  fundamentals, that gathered momentum thanks to the buildup in global liquidity provided by the  unprecedented quantitative easing (QE) in advanced economies is here to stay. This creates an  asymmetry between financial market conditions and the real economy that will remain a  structural feature of the global economy. The third argument in support of higher commodity  prices is made on the basis of long-term fundamentals. These will stem from several factors: a  larger world population, up from 7 billion in 2012 to over 9 billion in 2050, higher per capita  energy consumption as emerging and developing economies catch up on GDP levels, and the  recovery of advanced economy growth to normal levels.   5     11. The new normal argument in this context is that these global price pressures will transmit  to Indian prices either because of actual imports or because of largely import parity pricing,  thereby stoking inflation pressures.     (iii) The Positive Supply Shock of the Great Moderation Has Run Out  12. The world enjoyed an extended period of extraordinary price stability during the Great  Moderation of the pre-crisis years. As we now know, this was largely the benign influence of the  integration of emerging economies, especially China, into the global economy. Through the 80s  and 90s, China alone added over a billion people to the global labour pool. This raised global  production, but  without commensurate increase in demand, and hence prices remained low.    13. The world, it is argued, will not return to the Great Moderation situation post-crisis. As  China goes forward on its rebalancing from external demand to domestic demand, the global  economy will see shrinking of low cost supplies from China and hence higher prices. The era of  cheap imports is over and done forever.    14. The new normal argument in this context runs as follows. Because the positive supply  shock from China has all but waned, global inflation will shift to a new normal once the recovery  is complete. The Reserve Banks implicit formula is to calibrate its comfort level of inflation  some 2-3 percentage points above the average rate of inflation in advanced economies, while  also aiming to converge to the world average inflation in the medium-term. If so, it should  recognize the new global normal for inflation and recalibrate its comfort level for domestic  inflation accordingly.    (iv) Quantitative Easing will Lead to Higher Inflation in Advanced Economies   6     15. Advanced economy central banks have battled the global financial crisis with an unusual  show of policy force by resorting to unprecedented levels of Quantitative Easing. It is argued  that this excess will haunt their economies through higher and persistent inflation once they  recover to an equilibrium level.     16. Will advanced economies have an incentive to battle those inflation pressures? Possibly  not. Given their extraordinary fiscal pressures and consequent heavy obligation of public debt  servicing, they may in fact find it a convenient way to inflate their way out of debt.    17. The Indian dimension of this global outlook is as follows. If higher level of inflation in  advanced economies on the way forward is inevitable, India should recognize this, and factor it  into its policy calculus consistent with its goal of inflation a few percentage points above the  average inflation in AEs.     (v) India should Exploit the Positive Relationship Suggested by the Philips Curve    18. Macroeconomists have long struggled with the dilemma posed by the Philips Curve  relationship. The Philips Curve is just an empirically observed positive relationship between  inflation and growth (or an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment).  Notwithstanding subsequent economic research, some of it rewarded with Nobel Prizes, which  showed that the Philips Curve trade-off has no theoretical basis, there is a school of thought that  monetary policy can exploit this inflation-growth trade-off to achieve higher growth (or lower  unemployment) by tolerating slightly higher inflation.    19. For those who believe in the Philips Curve trade-off, India presents a persuasive case for  bargaining away a bit of inflation to secure higher growth because the multiplier impact of  7   higher growth on poverty reduction will be larger in the case of India. But wouldnt higher  inflation hurt the poor? The proponents argue that it will not because higher real incomes will  raise purchasing power to more than offset the impact of higher inflation.     20. It should be noted that the new normal inflation argument deriving from the Philips  Curve is different from the earlier arguments in one important way. The earlier arguments have  an involuntary dimension. India cannot influence these forces; it has to perforce adjust to them.  In contrast, the Philips Curve argument involves a voluntary policy choice of accepting higher  inflation to secure higher growth. Should that choice be made, it will require the Reserve Bank to  recalibrate its inflation goal at a higher level.     (vi) PPP Convergence on Account of Indias Integration into the Global Economy will  Imply Accepting a New Normal for Inflation     21. This argument is based on the Balassa-Samuelson effect which says that the absolute  price level in a developing economy needs to converge with those of developed economies as it  integrates into the global economy on account of PPP (purchasing power parity) catch up. In  the process of this catch-up, wages may increase ahead of productivity levels, especially in the  non-tradeable sector, leading to inflation.     22. Indias integration with the global economy over the last ten years has been much more  rapid than we tend to acknowledge, and over the next ten years, it will be much more rapid than  we tend to believe. The Economic Survey of 2011/12 had argued that this PPP convergence  process for India over the next 30 years would involve an additional inflation of 2 percentage  points with no exchange rate adjustment and 1.5 per centage points if the rupee is allowed to  8   appreciate. The counsel to monetary authorities accordingly is to acquiesce in this new normal  and support growth to hasten the process of PPP catch up.     Debate About a New Normal not Unique to India  23. Interestingly, the debate about a new normal for inflation is not unique to India; it is  playing out in several countries in the post-crisis context in, of course, different ways.     3 24. As early as in 2000, Bernanke  had argued that the Bank of Japans (BoJ) monetary  policy had hit the Keynesian liquidity trap, and that the BoJ should raise its inflation tolerance to  3 to 4 per cent in order to flog the deflationary forces.     25. As the global financial crisis unfolded, Bernanke found himself at the receiving end of  4 5 similar advice when Blanchard et al. and Krugman had, separately and independently, argued  that the Federal Reserve should raise its inflation target from 2 per cent to 4 per cent in order to  give itself larger head room for conventional monetary easing and thereby avoid, or at any rate  delay, recourse to unconventional monetary easing. Quantitative estimates have reinforced this  argument by showing that at an inflation target of 4 per cent, the probability of the Fed Funds  Rate touching zero is less than 1 per cent. The Fed has, however, resisted this call for a higher                                                      3       Ben S  Bernanke, Japanese Monetary Policy: A Case of Self-induced Paralysis, Institute for  International Economics, Special Report 13, September 2000.    4  Olivier Blanchard, Giovanni Dell Ariccia, and Paolo Mauro, Rethinking Macroeconomic  Policy, IMF Staff Position Note, February 12, 2010.    5      Paul Krugman, Earth to Ben Bernanke: Chairman Bernanke Should Listen to Professor     Bernanke, New York Times, August 24, 2012   9   inflation target by arguing that this exposes the economy to the risk of higher inflation by  6 unhinging inflation expectations.    26. More recently, a higher inflation target debate played out in Japan in a more high profile  fashion. In deference to the electoral commitment of the incoming government to provide a  growth stimulus, the Bank of Japan raised its goal of 1% inflation to a target of 2% inflation  which it hopes to achieve through unlimited bond purchase.    27. In the UK, a battle of ideas is playing out on how to revive the sagging economy. The  Government has firmly embraced a fiscal consolidation plan, but the private sector is yet to take  up the slack left by the Government and demand is yet to revive. The burden of stimulating the  economy has therefore fallen on the Bank of England (BoE), an inflation targeter, which found  itself consistently overshooting its inflation target over several successive months till mid-2012.     28. This policy context has triggered a debate in the UK on whether inflation targeting is an  appropriate policy stance in the face of unyielding recession. One option as suggested by Mark  Carney, soon to be BoE Governor, is that central banks could consider targeting nominal GDP  instead of inflation. Nominal GDP targeting, by reducing uncertainty about how long monetary  policy will stay easy, allows a central bank to persist with an accommodative monetary stance to  stimulate growth even if inflation is above its comfort level. This is not costless though. It  increases uncertainty about future inflation and can therefore potentially unhinge inflation  expectations from their anchor around the targeted inflation.                                                          6  Esther L George, The US Economy and Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve  Bank of Kansas     City. 10   29. Even as these debates about a new normal for inflation are becoming more commonplace  around the world, the context similarity between India and advanced economies should not be  stretched. The concern in advanced economies is about how to continue with the stance of  monetary easing even after the policy interest rates have hit the zero lower bound so as to  minimize loss of employment and output. The concern in emerging economies in general, and  India in particular, on the contrary, is an aspiration for higher growth aimed at poverty reduction,  even if it entails higher, albeit not much higher, inflation. It is important to acknowledge this  vital difference in evaluating the arguments for and against a higher normal for inflation.     Why is it Important to Recognise if There is a New Normal for Inflation?  30. It is important because not recognizing an upward long-term structural shift in normal  inflation can lead to a flawed monetary policy stance with potentially heavy macroeconomic  costs.     31. This can be understood in the paradigm of type-I and type-II errors in statistical analysis.  If indeed there is a new normal and it is not recognized, this could lead to an overtightening of  monetary policy, a type-II error. But there could be a type-I error too if the new normal is  wrongly recognized and monetary conditions are kept accommodative for too long, thereby  fuelling higher inflation. Theory also tells us that efforts to minimize one type of error result in  maximizing the other type of error. So, where should the balance lie? Even if there is arguably a  new normal for inflation, wouldnt it be more prudent to err on the side of caution? And what  will be the price to be paid for that prudence on the inflation front in terms of lost growth?     32. Central banks face a complex policy choice in managing the growth-inflation balance.  Experience shows that policy mistakes cannot easily be reversed in short order, and typically not  11   before heavy costs have been paid by way of welfare loss. At the same time, the probability of  policy mistakes is high because it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the potential growth  rate of the economy in real time.     33. Economic history of the last 50 years, especially of the US, contains several instances  where central banks are alleged to have made costly errors. The best known example is the  Volcker disinflation policy of the early 1980s. Paul Volcker, the Fed Chairman of the time, is  largely credited with restoring price stability in the US, but subsequently there have been  questions about whether too high a price was paid for it by way of two recessions and a surge in  unemployment. Was there, in fact, a new higher normal for US inflation that Volcker did not  recognize? If indeed there was, how does it square with the low inflation experience of the US  over the last two decades? This is a debate that is yet to be settled.     34. The importance of having an accurate estimate of the normal values of the fundamental  economic variables of an economy - potential growth rate, natural rate of unemployment and  threshold inflation - in order to accurately calibrate policy got reinforced recently in the context  of the US Feds announcement in December 2012 that it will maintain its current easy monetary  policy stance as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 per cent provided inflation  is only slightly above its target and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored. This has  raised a question about whether the Fed has accepted 6.5 per cent as the new normal for  unemployment. It has raised an even more important question about whether 6.5 per cent  unemployment is, in fact, an underestimate in which case the Fed would run the risk of  maintaining its easy stance for far too long, thereby stoking inflation.       12     New Normal - Counter Arguments    35. Let me now put across the Reserve Banks assessment and position on each of the  arguments for new normal as summarized earlier.     (i) Wage-Price Spiral cannot Sustain Indefinitely  36. The thrust of our response to the wage-price spiral argument is that even if inclusive  growth policies, liberal fiscal entitlements and heightened inflation expectations - driven  primarily by food inflation - trigger a wage-price spiral, it cannot be sustained in the absence of  an accommodative monetary policy. Admittedly, wage pressures, unaccompanied by  productivity increases, start off as demand shocks, but soon transform to act more like supply  shocks.     37. Like any other supply shock, exogenously imposed higher wages can be inflationary in  the first round, but the bargaining power of labour will erode in time, and the necessary  adjustment will take place to bring wages back in line with productivity levels. The recent high  growth in rural wages also reflects a catch up with minimum wages, a necessary adjustment  intended by the Government. After the initial catch-up, however, wage growth cannot be  sustained without corresponding productivity increases. If not, firms will gradually lose their  power to translate higher input prices to higher output prices, inevitably leading to a correction in  the wage pressures.    38. Furthermore, we must recognize that the Government does not have the fiscal capacity to  continue entitlements and welfare programmes at this level. The Governments embrace fiscal  responsibility will act as a self-limiting check on the wage-price spiral.  13     (ii) Commodity Price Shocks are Unlikely to Persist  39. Even as the arguments in support of continued upward pressure on global commodity  prices are compelling, there are some credible arguments to the contrary, drawing mainly from  an alternate energy scenario going forward. The global energy scenario will change on three  dimensions - efficiency, demand and supply.     40. On the efficiency front, regulatory and competitive pressures will ensure that gains from  energy efficiency will continue to roll in, possibly at an accelerated pace. From the demand  perspective, the impact of these efficiency gains on emerging economies will be larger, in the  sense that the energy intensity of their GDP growth will be lower than that of advanced  economies when the latter were at similar levels of GDP. China is, in fact, projected to move  onto a less energy-intensive development path by 2020.     41. From the supply perspective, the shale revolution, first for gas and then for oil, is  expected to contribute almost a fifth of the increase in global energy supply by 2030. A roughly  similar positive contribution is likely from renewable sources of energy - expected to treble by  2030.  Growing domestic production and near flat consumption may see the US become self- sufficient in energy by 2030. Supply from Iraq is projected to increase steadily, and by 2030 it is  likely to become the second largest global oil exporter, overtaking Russia.     42. Add to all this, the lessons of experience. For over a century now, commodity prices have  been prone to mean reversion. There is no reason why this time it should be very different.     43. Admittedly, gains on the energy front will translate to gains on the inflation front only if  other policies are managed intelligently. In particular, demand for land from industrialization and  14   urbanization should not be allowed to crowd out bio-fuel production. Simultaneously,  agricultural productivity needs to increase so as to meet the food requirements of a growing  population even if some land is ceded for bio-fuel cultivation.      44. The thrust of the Reserve Banks argument is that the current and projected trends for the  global energy scenario do not provide a persuasive case for raising Indias normal inflation.     (iii) Global Rebalancing will Ensure Benign Inflation  45. The new normal argument that I cited earlier is that Chinas ability to exert downward  pressure on global prices will wane. It certainly will, but only gradually. Given the size of  Chinas economy, it will continue to be the worlds cheap manufacturer for at least the next  decade, thereby keeping global inflation under check. Even as China moves up the value chain,  the space vacated by it will be occupied by other emerging and developing economies. All this  suggests that multiple poles of global growth and competitive pressures will ensure that global  inflation remains benign for at least the next decade. The argument that India must recalibrate its  inflation higher because global inflation is going to be higher loses its potency if, in fact, higher  global inflation is not a credible threat.     (iv) QE - No Risk to Global Inflation in the Medium-Term  46. Let me now address the argument about advanced economies suffering higher inflation  down the road because of QE. There is a view that this threat is being exaggerated. Advanced  economy central banks, especially the US Fed, have repeatedly asserted that they have in place  well thought through plans to unwind QE in a non-inflationary way. Also note that long term  inflation expectations in advanced economies do not suggest any risk to price stability.     15   47. Most importantly, nothing hurts the election prospects of a democratic government more  than rising prices. Political economy compulsions will therefore ensure that governments do not  resort to inflating their way out of debt.     (v) The Philips Curve Relationship does not Provide a Realistic Policy Option    48. Experience since the 1990s demonstrates that the secular growth-inflation trade-off  suggested by the Philips curve does not hold at all levels of inflation. The relationship is indeed  non-linear and reversible. There is a threshold level of inflation, below which it might be  possible to exploit the growth-inflation trade-off. However, if inflation is above the threshold, it  is decidedly inimical to growth as higher inflation does not raise, but actually lowers the growth  rate.       7 49. Mohanty et al. (2011) have estimated that the threshold inflation for India is in the range  of 4.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Updated estimates, using the same methodology, yield a range of  4.4 per cent to 5.7 per cent, implying a mid-point rate of about 5.0 per cent. Even though an  estimated threshold inflation rate need not be the optimal inflation target for a central bank, it  nevertheless provides a reference point for calibrating the normal inflation. The surmise is that  empirical research does not support the case for a new normal.     (vi) New Normal on Account of PPP Convergence is not Inevitable   50. Apart from all the empirical arguments, there is also an important conceptual argument  against the new normal hypothesis. As Indias integration with the world picks up pace over the  next decade, it is important also that our inflation rate is in line with global inflation. A new                                                      7  Deepak Mohanty, A B Chakraborty, Abhiman Das and Joice John, Inflation Threshold in  India: An Empirical Investigation W P S (DEPR) : 18 / 2011  16   normal based entirely on domestic considerations will result in a permanent wedge between  domestic and global inflation which means a persistent real appreciation of currency. Real  appreciation is unambiguously contractionary and militates against our growth aspiration. To  support sustainable growth during a period when the economy is globalizing, our inflation rate  needs to converge with the global inflation rate.  This is the rationale behind the Reserve Banks  policy of calibrating its medium term inflation goal to global inflation.    51. This is an appropriate context for me to respond to the argument for a new normal based  on the PPP convergence argument. Our view on this is that PPP convergence cannot be a policy  goal, and accepting higher inflation to aid PPP catch up will be both futile and indefensible. As  Indias per capita income rises, PPP convergence will happen automatically. We need to make  sure that rise in incomes is accompanied by productivity gains so that the process of PPP catch  up is non-inflationary.      52. There is also no a priori reason to believe that the entire burden of adjustment on account  of integration with the global economy will have to come by way of the price differential  closing. Part, if not all, of the burden can be borne by exchange rate adjustment too as evidenced  by the experience of Japan starting the 1960, when the yen appreciated by over 300 per cent to  close the price gap. How the burden of adjustment is shared between price levels and exchange  rates will depend on country circumstances - in particular the economys structural constraints  and market rigidities.     53. To support sustainable growth during a period when the economy is globalizing, our  inflation rate needs to converge with the global inflation rate. We need to manage this  17   convergence by calibrating the inflation differential over time rather than acquiescing in a new  normal for inflation.     Conclusion  54. Admittedly, the average inflation rate in India over the last three years has trended up.   Nevertheless, the context presents neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the Reserve  Bank to revise its inflation goal. Not a necessary condition because, as indicated earlier, much of  our inflation is driven by supply constraints which can be corrected by appropriate policies and  their effective implementation. Accepting a new normal for inflation not only has no theoretical  or empirical support, but entails the moral hazard of policy inaction in dealing with supply  constraints. Not a sufficient condition because there is no empirical evidence to establish that the  benefits of higher growth outweigh the costs of welfare loss associated with higher inflation.     55. Key to our collective national aspiration for sustained high economic growth is low and  steady inflation. It is only under such an environment of price stability that investors and  consumers can make informed choices and contribute to growth. The responsibility of the  Reserve Bank in this regard is to anchor inflation expectations and ensure price stability. Neither  theory nor empirical evidence presents a credible case for acquiescing in a new normal for  inflation in India.   18
