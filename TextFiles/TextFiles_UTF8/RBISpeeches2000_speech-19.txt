I am thankful to the organisers for giving me the honour and privilege of Nehru to succeed Dr. C.D.  as the Chairman of University Grants Commission in 1961. Unfortunately his untimely death soon after he assumed charge deprived the nation of his services.  His visionary Andhra University for over a decade ensured starting of Physics, Meteorology, Oceanography and Statistics.  His administrative experience as of Imperial Bank of India must have added to his effectiveness as Vice Chancellor and earlier as Principal.  He graduated from Oxford and is one of the few economists from India to have been trained in Economics in Austria, having obtained his Ph.D. from Vienna.   I was only twenty years of age when Dr. Krishna passed away. I was also not educated in this University ; with the result that I did not have the pleasure of knowing him personally.

There have been significant changes in their role and functioning since Dr. Krishna dealt with the subject in 1946 and a quote from Mr. M. Narasimhams A.D. Shroff Memorial Lecture in 1984 on the subject would be of relevance here. There is nothing wrong in the Fund evolving with the times, but the evolution of the Fund, at least in respect of its central objectives as stated at Bretton Woods, has been an evolution towards its irrelevance.  On the other hand, as we know, the Fund has become central to the management of the international debt crises and has become even more important than it ever was in its role of disciplining developing member countries to the point of its In fact, fifteen years after this suggestion, a comprehensive review of these institutions is taking place.

Substantive negotiations were essentially between the U.K. and the U.S.A., and thus between their spokesmen, viz., Lord Keynes and Mr. Harry Dexter White.  The problems and perspectives were thus  the post-war era, and the painful memories of the Great Depression.  The major contribution of the Conference was the acceptance of the idea that the international monetary system has to operate within a framework of cooperation and consultation among Governments.  It also accepted the idea of a provision of resources to a country the basis for the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  It also  the need for transfer of resources from capital surplus to capital deficit countries through the intermediation of an official multilateral body, viz., the International Bank for The basic structural characteristics of BWIs remain somewhat unchanged. Governments are political bodies, and these institutions, which are creatures of Governments are bound to be political; and, therefore, their membership and functioning open only to Governments, is naturally voluntary.  They are cooperative in character, trading strengths.  So, they are akin to cooperatives whose members have unequal strength.  They are also like clubs, where members are expected to observe certain rules regarding conduct of economic policy, within a mutually acceptable framework which Members are permitted to draw resources from each of the institutions, subject to form of a loan repayable along with some interest or fees.  The institutions prescribe conditions or covenants for drawing such resources, and thus those who draw resources are subjected to more severe obligations to the institutions than others .  These structural The membership, however, has been increasing from less than fifty when they commenced operations, to over a hundred and eighty now.

The Bretton Woods  were thus functioning for over thirty years claiming to be world bodies without membership of the large socialist bloc.  The eighties, however, saw active participation of China which got its rightful place, while the nineties brought Russia into its membership.  In brief, these institutions are more representative of the world economy During their history of over fifty years, there have been both institutional innovations and a changing focus to meet the dynamics of global economy.  Thus,  which initially assisted war-torn economies, such as Japan and France soon left this task to the U.S.A. under the Marshall Plan and concentrated on developing countries. Originally envisaged to provide only project-specific loans, IBRD shifted its focus to programme-lending, structural adjustment, and more recently, to policy lending.  From commercially viable projects, the focus shifted to social sectors, then to poverty-related issues and more recently to governance issues as well as to institutional development. Efforts of IBRD were supplemented by Regional Banks (like Asian Development Bank, In the IBRD, only a part of the subscribed capital is paid-in by member countries and the rest is callable. The members do not claim dividends on profits. The bulk of lendable resources of IBRD are by borrowings from capital markets and hence, IBRD can, in turn, lend only to those countries, which are considered creditworthy.  This implied that many poorer countries were not eligible, in the sense that any loans to them from the IBRD would have adversely affected the quantum and rate at which the IBRD could raise its lendable resources from the capital markets. In these circumstances, International Development Association (IDA), an affiliate of the IBRD, was established, consisting of contributions in the form of grants from the Governments of developed available to the IDA.  Another body, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was also sponsored as an affiliate of the World Bank, specialising in providing finance to the private sector. Membership of the affiliates is, by and large, common to that of the IBRD and these institutions together constitute the World Bank Group.  A more recent addition Since 1999, the emphasis of the World Bank group is on the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF). The CDF aims at suggesting a holistic approach to development that recognises the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals and yet assigns equal weight to the institutional, structural and social underpinnings of a robust sector and other developmental actors is emphasised in the CDF. The Bank also reaffirmed its commitment to fight poverty and renamed the new objective as to fight poverty with passion and professionalism, for lasting results.

It is evident that the World Similarly, the IMF has also been attempting to adapt itself to changing needs. Under the original Bretton Woods exchange rate regime, each country would set a fixed value  called par value of its currency in terms of gold or the U.S. Dollar.  The par values of two currencies determined the official exchange rate (also called parity) from a countrys own reserves and if necessary by loans (technically termed as purchases) from the IMF, any fundamental balance of payments problems were to be corrected by exchange rate changes.  This system ran into problems in the sixties, since fixed exchange rate regime constrained monetary policy in most developed countries. Due to difficulties faced in gold supplies and doubts on the role of U.S. dollar as a reserve asset, the IMF agreed to create Special Drawing Rights (SDR).  In 1971, USA closed its gold window and this led to floating rate regimes in many countries, replacing gold and par value systems that were bedrocks of the original IMF.  Due to several The IMF responded to several challenges to international monetary order with a series of facilities such as Compensatory and Contingency Financial Facility (1963), facilities for poor countries under Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (1999).  In the context of debt crises of Latin America in the early eighties, IMF emerged as a major In 1995, the IMF arranged a $40 billion rescue package for Mexico at the initiative of the USA.  The IMFs role and capacities were severely tested in the most recent crisis-episodes, viz. ,  East Asian, Russian and Brazilian crisis and herein lies the most serious provocation in their history for a thorough review of Bretton Woods It is worth noting here that until the nineties, problems in a countrys balance of payments were, barring shocks, essentially a consequence of what could be termed as inappropriate policies of the Governments in the countries concerned.  The Asian crisis, however, highlighted a new dimension to the problem.  The Asian crisis was largely attributable to failures in the private sector  both in the recipient as well as lending countries.  This new dimension is an important element in the set of factors that have It would be inappropriate to conclude that the BWIs have been successful in all in that light without prejudice to improving their functioning or even evolving parallel or 5 significant mechanisms for multilateral cooperation and have to be continuously assessed to the global challenges or to the problems of individual countries.

The current debate is, in fact, on India was a founder member, along with 38 countries and has been an active member of the Fund right from its inception. India obtained a quota, which ranked her among the five largest stake holding members of the Fund and the World Bank. Indias fifth place assumes significance as each of the five largest stake holding is entitled to a permanent chair in the Executive Board and appoint its own Executive Director.  thus enjoyed a permanent seat in the Fund at the time of its inception. However, in the early seventies, Japan improved its quota and share-holding to rank amongst the five Indias recourse to the IMF was limited during the period 1945 to the 1980s. Before the First Five-Year Plan, India borrowed a moderate amount of SDR 100 million under the lower tranche (generally up to 50 per cent of the quota). During the Second Five-Year Plan period, to cope up with the problem of balance of payments, an amount equivalent of SDR 200 million was borrowed from the IMF. During the Third Plan period, India encountered severe balance of payments problem and hence borrowed a higher amount of SDR 375 million from the Fund. During 1965 and 1968, the balance of payments situation worsened and India devalued its currency and sought IMF assistance to the tune of SDR 415 million including SDR 90 million under the Compensatory The next availment of the IMF facility was during 1973-74, when India was affected by the first oil shock and hence borrowed SDR 775 million including SDR 200 million under the oil facility. Then again during July 1978 and December 1980, India In the early 1980s, to finance the huge current account deficits, India entered into three year Extended Arrangements with the IMF for SDR 5 billion in November 1981.

Taken together, liabilities to IBRD and IDA stood at about US $ 26.4 billion as at the end of March 1999. India experienced a negative transfer of resources to the World Bank group during 1993-98.

This debate has put forth a number of proposals and the formation of a number of new forums, and I The increasing global character of financial markets and its growing links between the different segments of the financial sector has motivated some to propose a global agency for financial regulation and supervision or World Financial Authority (WFA). The second argument for WFA is that the financial sector in many countries involves cross-border transactions and transmission of instability across borders and There are different models of WFA and these vary from improvement from existing arrangements to the ones that are more comprehensive in terms of responsibilities.  One such proposal was by John Eatwell and Lance Taylor, who called all financial enterprises  banks, insurance funds, companies  both on-shore and off- shore.

This raises the question of the need for international lender of last resort (ILOLR) and whether IMF can fulfill that role. It is argued that it cannot act as a lender of last resort because it is not an international central bank and, therefore, cannot create international reserves; it does not have enough resources and IMF is low on resources during emergencies. The defense has been that although it cannot create liquidity and may not be able to provide necessary financing from its own resources, the IMF can To enhance the resources available, India had argued for issuance of SDR by Fund to itself for use in ILOLR operation subject to pre-determined cumulative limit and other appropriate safeguards. Such a mechanism would not result in any permanent it is repurchased by the borrowing country) while providing for temporary additional Many supporters of the IMF see CCL as the first step towards making the IMF a true lender of last resort.

The ability of the IMF to provide international liquidity can be analysed in terms of its ability to provide conditional liquidity (Quota allocation) and unconditional liquidity (SDR allocation). The IMF has been unable to muster the requisite 85 per cent of voting power to make additional allocations on the basis of global need. Developing countries including India have consistently supported general access to most of Funds resources by member countries are set in relation to the quota. There is increasing concern that quota shares of the many developing countries, which have grown in both GDP and trade than in industrial countries have not include need based variables in the quota formula and to use more widely accepted PPP-based GDP in quota calculation. The Fund has recently established a committee quota allocation and it is hoped that this committee will come out with an answer Surveillance is one of the mechanism through which the IMF promotes good In June 1998, the Fund had commissioned an external evaluation by an expert panel head by Mr. John Crow (former Governor, Bank of Canada) of Fund surveillance over members policies under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement.

The Commission submitted its Report to the The Reports major recommendations are that the IMF should be downsized with unique responsibilities which are that it should be merely a quasi lender of last resort to emerging economies with short maturity loans, collect and publish financial data from members and provide advice (but not impose condition) relating to economic policy. Thus, the IMF should be precluded from making other types of loans, especially long- term subsidised loans. The Commission also suggests that the countries should avoid pegged or adjustable exchange rates and this should be a priority given in the Article IV Consultations. The Commission argues that the debt renegotiation practices are evolving rapidly without official intervention and, therefore, should be left to borrowers and lenders. The Commission recommends that currencies should be divided into G-5 IMF is sought to be a stand-by lender and in a crisis the Fund should borrow convertible Under the aegi s of G-20, the issue of codes and standards has become an important area.  Adoption of codes and standards are important for increasing transparency and for facilitating favourable market perceptions.  A Code of Good practices on Fiscal Transparency was approved by the Fund in 1998.  Similarly, a Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial policies has also been approved by the Interim Committee in September 1999.  Similarly, OECD has brought guidelines on Corporate Governance and the World Bank on Social Sector Policies.

The proposal has since beenA Standing Committee on International Financial Standards and Codes has been constituted in India with the joint membership of Government and the RBI.  The main task of this Committee is to identify and monitor developments in global standards and Considering that there are a number of codes in a wide variety of areas, the Committee has identified 10 different subjects, based on their criticality and importance and constituted an Advisory Group under the chairmanship of eminent personalities. Thus Advisory Groups have been constituted in the area of fiscal transparency, transparency of monetary and financial policies, banking supervision, securities market regulation, insurance regulation, accounting and auditing, bankruptcy, corporate and compliance in India of the relevant standards and codes, given the prevailing legal and institutional framework.  The Advisory Groups will also compare the levels of adherence in India vis--vis industrialised countries as also emerging economies with a view to understanding Indias position and prioritising actions on some of the more The Reports of the Groups will be made available to all concerned in public and It is clear that the international financial architecture is being revisited on several fronts and the role of the BWIs as well as the framework of the functioning of the BWIs are integral to this process of review.  There is clearly a consensus, as of now, that no new bureaucracies or international financial institutions be set up.  There is also a Stability Forum and G-20 are prime examples.  The process of international cooperation is no longer confined to fora where only national Governments are involved though they continue to be critical.  The operational framework of BWIs is under review and as to India is closely involved in these processes as one of the giant economies, with a last instalment amount of about US $ 25 million to the Fund in June, 2000.  In fact, by pursuing appropriate policies, we have been able to repurchase almost all our obligations in the last seven years.  Besides, during this period, we have built up over $36 billion of foreign exchange reserves while maintaining the external debt almost constant. If the macro policies continue to be sound to ensure progress in desirable directions of 17 resources of BWIs, India will be repaying the On the limited issue of utilisation of  significant interface now with the global financial system. the centre stage. what shape this would take, it is difficult to speculate, but the BWIs will continue to be in consensus that multiple fora for consultation and cooperation are desirable and, Financial Conclusion private sectors. for achieving the best practices. important codes and standards.

The Committee wouldefficiency and stability, I believe there will be no need for us to approach Fund for any assistance. With a comfortable external sector position, significant reduction in the Governments fiscal deficit should help the Government to phase out its dependence on IDA whose level of resources is getting depleted.  Over the medium-term, it should also be possible to earmark all loans from IBRD for utilisation in long gestation but commercially viable projects such as those in infrastructure, perhaps in quasi- Government sector.  In this background, I could envisage a more active role for India in The major thrust for policy for the Government in the near future would, therefore, be three-fold.  The first major thrust would be to ensure the continued implementation of appropriate macro policies; the second key thrust would be to address satisfactorily social issues, such as poverty, primary education, primary health, environmental protection, governance, etc.  The third area of attention would be to benchmark our institutional and procedural frameworks governing the fiscal, monetary, accounting and regulatory areas with international best practices and aligning ourselves with them.  The recently established Standing Committee on Codes and the eminent persons associated with Advisory Groups should help us in the third thrust area but this will be of help only if there is matching progress in areas relating to macro policies and To conclude, the  role in an environment of high proportion of private capital flows is likely to be relatively one of catalyst, whereby it renders support and advice to outside bodies such as G-20 and BIS in respect of evolution of standards and codes, that do not fall within  core competence.  In this context, the need to clarify the respective roles of the BWIs in particular and international financial institutions in general becomes essential.  One can envisage a situation where the BWIs reform internally not merely through change in voting rights but also in the manner of its functioning, by exhibiting greater willingness to coordinate more effectively with 18 Govindarajan for his valuable comments on an earlier version of the draft.
