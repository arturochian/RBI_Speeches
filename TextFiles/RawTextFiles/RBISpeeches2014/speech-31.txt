growth
} LBS to aim at comprehensive Financial Inclusion using multiple channels,
intermediaries and Information Technology

25} CD Ratio is the ratio of outstanding credit to outstanding deposit at a
particular point of time.
} It is a function of credit absorption capacity which is dependent on
the development level of the States in the form of availability of
necessary infrastructure facilities required for development of
industries, agriculture & service sector etc.
} This is a regular item of agenda in SLBC & DCC meetings and
these fora identify  measures to enhance CD ratio and to increase
credit absorption capacities in the region.
} In 1980, RBI advised Public Sector Banks to achieve a CD Ratio
(CDR) of 60 in respect of their rural and semi urban branches,
separately, on an all India basis
} In 2005, banks are advised to set up Special Sub-Committee (SSC)
of District Consultative Committee (DCC) in districts with CDR < 40
in order to monitor and draw up Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) for
improving CDR on a self set graduated basis
