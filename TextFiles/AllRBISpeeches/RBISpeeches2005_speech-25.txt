Retail Banking - Opportunities and Challenges*Shyamala GopinathThe issue of retail banking is extremely important and topical. Across theglobe, retail lending has been a spectacular innovation in the commercial bankingsector in recent years.  The growth of retail lending, especially, in emergingeconomies, is attributable to the rapid advances in information technology, theevolving macroeconomic environment, financial market reform, and several micro-level demand and supply side factors.India too experienced a surge in retail banking. There are various pointerstowards this. Retail loan is estimated to have accounted for nearly one-fifth of allbank credit. Housing sector is experiencing a boom in its credit. The retail loanmarket has decisively got transformed from a sellers’ market to a buyers’ market.Gone are the days where getting a retail loan was somewhat cumbersome. All theseemphasise the momentum that retail banking is experiencing in the Indian economyin recent years.What is Retail Banking?Retail banking is, however, quite broad in nature - it refers to the dealing ofcommercial banks with individual customers, both on liabilities and assets sides ofthe balance sheet. Fixed, current / savings accounts on the liabilities side; andmortgages, loans (e.g., personal, housing, auto, and educational) on the assets side,are the more important of the products offered by banks.  Related ancillary servicesinclude credit cards, or depository services. Today’s retail banking sector ischaracterized by three basic characteristics:• multiple products (deposits, credit cards, insurance, investments andsecurities);• multiple channels of distribution (call centre, branch, Internet and kiosk); and• multiple customer groups (consumer, small business, and corporate).What is the nature of retail banking? In a recent book, retail banking has been1described as “hotter than vindaloo” . Considering the fact that vindaloo, the Indian-English innovative curry available in umpteen numbers of restaurants of London, isindeed very hot and spicy, it seems that retail banking is perceived to be the in-thingin today’s world of banking.                                                *Address by Deputy Governor as a Key-Note Speaker at the IBA - Banking Frontiers InternationalConference on “Retail Banking Directions: Opportunities & Challenges” on May 28, 2005 in Mumbai.The assistance of S/Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar and Partha Ray in preparing this address is gratefullyacknowledged.1 DiVanna, Joseph A. (2004): The Future of Retail Banking, New York: Palgrave Macmillan.2Retail banking in IndiaRetail banking in India is not a new phenomenon. It has always beenprevalent in India in various forms. For the last few years it has become synonymouswith mainstream banking for many banks.The typical products offered in the Indian retail banking segment are housingloans, consumption loans for purchase of durables, auto loans, credit cards andeducational loans. The loans are marketed under attractive brand names todifferentiate the products offered by different banks. As the Report on Trend andProgress of India, 2003-04 has shown that the loan values of these retail lendingtypically range between Rs.20,000 to Rs.100 lakh. The loans are generally forduration of five to seven years with housing loans granted for a longer duration of 15years. Credit card is another rapidly growing sub-segment of this product group.In recent past retail lending has turned out to be a key profit driver for bankswith retail portfolio constituting 21.5 per cent of total outstanding advances as onMarch 2004. The overall impairment of the retail loan portfolio worked out much lessthen the Gross NPA ratio for the entire loan portfolio. Within the retail segment, thehousing loans had the least gross asset impairment. In fact, retailing make amplebusiness sense in the banking sector.While new generation private sector banks have been able to create a nichein this regard, the public sector banks have not lagged behind. Leveraging their vastbranch network and outreach, public sector banks have aggressively forayed togarner a larger slice of the retail pie. By international standards, however, there isstill much scope for retail banking in India. After all, retail loans constitute less thanseven per cent of GDP in India vis-à-vis about 35 per cent for other Asian economies— South Korea (55 per cent), Taiwan (52 per cent), Malaysia (33 per cent) andThailand (18 per cent). As retail banking in India is still growing from modest base,there is a likelihood that the growth numbers seem to get somewhat exaggerated.One, thus, has to exercise caution is interpreting the growth of retail banking in India.Drivers of retail business in IndiaWhat has contributed to this retail growth? Let me briefly highlight some of thebasic reasons.First, economic prosperity and the consequent increase in purchasing powerhas given a fillip to a consumer boom. Note that during the 10 years after 1992,India's economy grew at an average rate of 6.8 percent and continues to grow at thealmost the same rate – not many countries in the world match this performance.Second, changing consumer demographics indicate vast potential for growthin consumption both qualitatively and quantitatively. India is one of the countries3having highest proportion (70%) of the population below 35 years of age (youngpopulation). The BRIC report of the Goldman-Sachs, which predicted a bright futurefor Brazil, Russia, India and China, mentioned Indian demographic advantage as animportant positive factor for India.Third, technological factors played a major role. Convenience banking in theform of debit cards, internet and phone-banking, anywhere and anytime banking hasattracted many new customers into the banking field. Technological innovationsrelating to increasing use of credit / debit cards, ATMs, direct debits and phonebanking has contributed to the growth of retail banking in India.Fourth, the Treasury income of the banks, which had strengthened the bottomlines of banks for the past few years, has been on the decline during the last twoyears. In such a scenario, retail business provides a good vehicle of profitmaximisation. Considering the fact that retail’s share in impaired assets is far lowerthan the overall bank loans and advances, retail loans have put comparatively lessprovisioning burden on banks apart from diversifying their income streams.Fifth, decline in interest rates have also contributed to the growth of retailcredit by generating the demand for such credit.In this backdrop let me now come two specific domains of retail lending inIndia, viz., (a) credit cards and (b) housing.Credit Cards in IndiaWhile usage of cards by customers of banks in India has been in vogue sincethe mid-1980s, it is only since the early 1990s that the market had witnessed aquantum jump. The total number of cards issued by 42 banks and outstanding,increased from 2.69 crore as on end December 2003 to 4.33 crore as on endDecember 2004. The actual usage too has registered increases both in terms ofvolume and value. Almost all the categories of banks issue credit cards.  Creditcards have found greater acceptance in terms of usage in the major cities of thecountry, with the four major metropolitan cities accounting for the bulk of thetransactions.In view of this ever increasing role of credit cards a Working Group was set upfor regulatory mechanism for cards. The terms of reference of the Working Groupwere fairly broad and the Group was to look into the type of regulatory measures thatare to be introduced for plastic cards (credit, debit and smart cards) for encouragingtheir growth in a safe, secure and efficient manner, as also to take care of the bestcustomer practices and grievances redressal mechanism for the card users. TheReserve Bank has been receiving a number of complaints regarding variousundesirable practices by credit card issuing institutions and their agents. Some ofthem are:4• Unsolicited calls to members of the public by card issuing banks/ direct sellingagents pressurising them to apply for credit card.• Communicating misleading / wrong information regarding credit cardsregarding conditions for issue, amount of service charges/ waiver of fees,gifts/prizes.• Sending credit cards to persons who have not applied for them / activatingunsolicited cards without the approval of the recipient.• Charging very high interest rates /service charges.• Lack of transparency in disclosing fees/charges/penalties. Non-disclosure ofdetailed billing procedure.The Working Group deliberated a number of major issues relating to: a) tocustomer grievances and rights: a) Transparency and Disclosure, b) CustomerRights Protection, and c) Code of Conduct. The Group recommended that the MostImportant Terms and Conditions should be highlighted and advertised and sentseparately to the prospective customer. These terms and conditions include variousissues relating to: a) fees and charges, (b) drawal limits, (c) billing, (d) default, (e)termination / revocation of card membership, (f) loss / theft / misuse of card, and (g)disclosure.These recommendations are being processed within the RBI and a set ofguidelines would be issued which are going to pave the path of a healthy growth inthe development of plastic money in India. The RBI is also considering bringingcredit card disputes within the ambit of the Banking Ombudsman scheme. Whilebuilding a regulatory oversight in this regard we need to ensure that neither does itreduce the efficiency of the system nor does it hamper the credit card usage.Housing Credit in IndiaIn view of its backward and forward linkages with other sectors of the economy,housing finance in developing countries is seen as a social good. In India, growth ofhousing finance segment has accelerated in recent years. Several supporting policymeasures (like tax benefits) and the supervisory incentives instituted had played amajor role in this market.Housing credit has increased substantially over last few years, but from a verylow base. During the period 1993-2004, outstanding housing loans by scheduledcommercial banks and housing finance companies grew at a trend rate of 23 percent. The share of housing loans in total non-food credit of scheduled commercialbanks has increased from about 3 per cent in 1992-93 to about 7 per cent in 2003-04.  Recent data reveal that non-priority sector housing loans outstanding as on5February 18, 2005 were around Rs. 74 thousand crore, which is, however, only 8.0per cent of the gross bank credit. As already pointed out, direct housing loans up toRs. 15 lakh irrespective of the location now qualify as priority sector lending; housingloans are understood to form a large component of such lending. In addition, housingcredit is also being provided by housing finance companies, which in turn are alsoreceiving some bank finance.Thus, from miniscule amounts, the exposure of the banking sector to housingloans has gone up. Unlike many other countries, asset impairment on account ofhousing finance constitutes a very small portion. However, with growing competitionin the housing finance market, there has been a growing concern over its likelyimpact on the asset quality. While no immediate financial stability concerns exist,there is a need to put in place appropriate risk management systems, strengtheninternal control procedures and also improve regulatory oversight in this area. Banksalso need to monitor their exposure and the credit quality. In a fiercely competitivemarket, there may be some temptation to slacken the loan scrutiny procedures andthis needs to be severely checked.Having delineated the broad contours of retail banking in India let me nowcome to its opportunities and challenges.Opportunities and Challenges of Retail Banking in IndiaRetail banking has immense opportunities in a growing economy like India. Asthe growth story gets unfolded in India, retail banking is going to emerge a majordriver. How does the world view us? I have already referred to the BRIC Reporttalking India as an economic superpower. A. T. Kearney, a global managementconsulting firm, recently identified India as the "second most attractive retaildestination" of 30 emergent markets.The rise of the Indian middle class is an important contributory factor in thisregard. The percentage of middle to high income Indian households is expected tocontinue rising. The younger population not only wields increasing purchasingpower, but as far as acquiring personal debt is concerned, they are perhaps morecomfortable than previous generations. Improving consumer purchasing power,coupled with more liberal attitudes toward personal debt, is contributing to India'sretail banking segment.The combination of the above factors promises substantial growth in the retailsector, which at present is in the nascent stage. Due to bundling of services anddelivery channels, the areas of potential conflicts of interest tend to increase inuniversal banks and financial conglomerates. Some of the key policy issues relevantto the retail banking sector are: financial inclusion, responsible lending, access tofinance, long-term savings, financial capability, consumer protection, regulation and6financial crime prevention. What are the challenges for the industry and itsstakeholders?First, retention of customers is going to be a major challenge. According to aresearch by Reichheld and Sasser in the Harvard Business Review, 5 per centincrease in customer retention can increase profitability by 35 per cent in bankingbusiness, 50 per cent in insurance and brokerage, and 125 per cent in the consumercredit card market. Thus, banks need to emphasise retaining customers andincreasing market share.Second, rising indebtedness could turn out to be a cause for concern in thefuture. India's position, of course, is not comparable to that of the developed worldwhere household debt as a proportion of disposable income is much higher. Such ascenario creates high uncertainty. Expressing concerns about the high growthwitnessed in the consumer credit segments the Reserve Bank has, as a temporarymeasure, put in place risk containment measures and increased the risk weight from100 per cent to 125 per cent in the case of consumer credit including personal loansand credit cards (Mid-term Review of Annual Policy, 2004-05).Third, information technology poses both opportunities and challenges. Evenwith ATM machines and Internet Banking, many consumers still prefer the personaltouch of their neighbourhood branch bank. Technology has made it possible todeliver services throughout the branch bank network, providing instant updates tochecking accounts and rapid movement of money for stock transfers. However, thisdependency on the network has brought IT departments additional responsibilitiesand challenges in managing, maintaining and optimizing the performance of retailbanking networks. Illustratively, ensuring that all bank products and services areavailable, at all times, and across the entire organization is essential for today’sretails banks to generate revenues and remain competitive. Besides, there arenetwork management challenges, whereby keeping these complex, distributednetworks and applications operating properly in support of business objectivesbecomes essential. Specific challenges include ensuring that account transactionapplications run efficiently between the branch offices and data centres.Fourth, KYC Issues and money laundering risks in retail banking is yetanother important issue. Retail lending is often regarded as a low risk area formoney laundering because of the perception of the sums involved. However,competition for clients may also lead to KYC procedures being waived in the bid fornew business. Banks must also consider seriously the type of identificationdocuments they will accept and other processes to be completed. The Reserve Bankhas issued details guidelines on application of KYC norms in November 2004.7Some Random ThoughtsHow do we see the future of retail banking? What are the major attributes ofthe shape of things to come in this sector? Let me share with you some of myrandom thoughts.First, customer service should be the be-all and end-all of retail banking. Theother day a document released by the British Bankers Association, entitled UK RetailBanking Manifesto: addressing the challenges that lie ahead for the industry and itsstakeholders on September 29, 2004 came to my notice. This document analysedthe key policy issues relevant to the retail banking sector and highlighted the role offinancial inclusion, responsible lending, access to finance, and consumer protection.It is in this context that that one is reminded of the needs to develop the standardsand codes for banking. The contribution of the Committee on Procedure &Performance Audit on Public Services (CPPAPS) (Chairman: Shri S.S. Tarapore)has been invaluable and has provided great insight. Based on the recommendationof the CPPAPS, the Annual Policy Statement for 2005-06 announced the decision toset up an independent Banking Codes & Standards Board of India on the model ofthe mechanism in the UK in order to ensure that comprehensive code of conduct forfair treatment of customers is evolved and adhered to. The codes and standards,together with the institutional mechanism to monitor them, are expected to enhancethe quality of customer service, to the individual customer in particular. The codeswill bring about greater transparency in the system and also tackle the issue ofinformation asymmetry. The Board would function as an industry-wide watchdog ofthe banking code and ensure that the banks comply with the banking codes. Thecodes would establish the banking industry’s key commitments and obligations tocustomers on standards of practice, disclosure and principles of conduct for theirbanking services. The Board will monitor compliance with the Codes by the affiliatedbanks.Second, sharing of information about the credit history of households isextremely important as far retail banking is concerned. Perhaps due the confidentialnature of banker-customer, banks have a traditional resistance to share creditinformation on the client, not only with one another, but also across sectors. Globally,Credit Information Bureaus have, therefore, been set up to function as a repository ofcredit information - both current and historical data on existing and potentialborrowers. The database maintained by these institutions can be accessed by thelending institutions. Credit Bureaus have been established not only in countries withdeveloped financial systems but also in countries with relatively less developedfinancial markets, such as, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Bangladesh and the Philippines.  InIndian case, the Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL), incorporated in2000, aims at fulfilling the need of credit granting institutions for comprehensivecredit information by collecting, collating and disseminating credit information8pertaining to both commercial and consumer borrowers. At the same time banksmust exercise due diligence before declaring a borrower as defaulter.Third, outsourcing has become an important issue in the recent past. With theincreasing market orientation of the financial system and to cope with thecompetition as also to benefit from the technological innovations such as, e-banking,the banks are making increasing use of "outsourcing" as a means of both reducingcosts and achieving better efficiency. While outsourcing does have various costadvantages, it has the potential to transfer risk, management and compliance to thirdparties who may not be regulated. A recent BIS Report on “Outsourcing in FinancialServices” developed some high-level principles. A basic requirement in this contextis that a regulated entity seeking to outsource activities should have in place acomprehensive policy on outsourcing including a comprehensive outsourcing riskmanagement programme to address the outsourced activities and the relationshipwith the service provider. Application of these principles in the Indian context isunder consideration.Finally, retail banking does not refer to lending only. In the whole story ofretailing one should not forget the role played by retail depositors. The homemaker,the retail shop keeper, the pensioners, self-employed and those employed inunorganised sector - all need to get a place in the banks.  It is in this backdrop thatthe Annual Policy for 2005-06 pointed out issues relating to financial exclusion andhad announced that the RBI would implement policies to encourage banks whichprovide extensive services while disincentivising those which are not responsive tothe banking needs of the community, including the underprivileged.  Furthermore,the nature, scope and cost of services need to be monitored to assess whether thereis any denial, implicit or explicit, of basic banking services to the common person andbanks have been urged to review their existing practices to align them with theobjective of financial inclusion.ConclusionThere is a need of constant innovation in retail banking. In bracing fortomorrow, a paradigm shift in bank financing through innovative products andmechanisms involving constant upgradation and revalidation of the banks’ internalsystems and processes is called for. Banks now need to use retail as a growthtrigger. This requires product development and differentiation, innovation andbusiness process reengineering, micro-planning, marketing, prudent pricing,customisation, technological upgradation, home / electronic / mobile banking, costreduction and cross-selling.While retail banking offers phenomenal opportunities for growth, thechallenges are equally daunting. How far the retail banking is able to lead growth ofthe banking industry in future would depend upon the capacity building of the banks9to meet the challenges and make use of the opportunities profitably. However, thekind of technology used and the efficiency of operations would provide the muchneeded competitive edge for success in retail banking business. Furthermore, in allthese customers’ interest is of paramount importance. The banking sector in India isdemonstrating this and I do hope they would continue to chart in this traded path.Thank You.
