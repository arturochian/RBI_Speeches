*Current Concerns and Some Perspectives on Inflation Dear Shri Bajpaiji, Shri C. S. Rao garu, Shri Kamesam, Dr. Gulati and friends,At the outset, I am thankful to the Institute for inviting me to this function and giving the pleasureof being with you all. The programme clearly says that I have to give some concluding remarks. Thismakes it clear that my presence is essentially ceremonial – hand over the certificates to the bright youngpeople and just give a few remarks, basically perhaps because the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fundsthis Institute. I think it is a very wise thing for the Institute for Development Research in BankingTechnology (IDRBT) to express thanks to those who fund and cultivate those who matter. I will, however,take the opportunity to make some comments on current concerns on inflation.Financial RegulationTo begin with, there will be a few comments on the addresses delivered today and then somereference to the IDRBT. Shri C. S. Rao, Chairman, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority(IRDA) emphasised the synergy that is developing between banking and insurance. There are twoelements here – one from the macro-side and the other from the operational or the micro-side. India’scontractual savings and long-term savings are rather low, which is why we are not able to invest heavilyin infrastructure, and that is the macro part where insurance has a critical role. The second part is thatmuch of business in our country is not really covered by insurance. The growth of economic activityrequires risk-mitigation and the classic case is agriculture in India. So if we don’t have the risk mitigationmeasures, the capacity for increasing the economic activity gets constrained. We pride ourselves thatfinancial sector reforms in India started early in the reform cycle, but within the financial sector, theinsurance reforms came in rather late in the cycle. Hence, there is enormous scope for expansion in thatarea. Shri Rao’s focus on the linking of banks and insurance sector, taking advantage of the penetrationthat banks already have in the rural areas, is a remarkable approach and admittedly, it is extremelyuseful to use the technology in this process. We should work further on this and I am sure the banks,especially public sector banks, have great business potential too in bankassurance.Shri Bajpai, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has covered in hisaddress both historical perspective and cross-country perspective. As compared to most other countries,the extent of progress that has been made by our securities regulator in terms of technology penetrationand safety measures is impressive and currently, absolutely world class. SEBI should be proud of that.As we go along, there is a need to be abreast of the global developments and at the same time integrateit into our own unique socio-economic circumstances.There are two issues – one is at the operational level and the other is the overall stability issue inregard to the role of the financial regulators – and on both these counts, by and large, we have everyreason to be proud of our achievements. We withstood the external and domestic challenges as well aseconomic and political ones in the last ten years. India emerges from the 1990s, as an island of financialstability in a sea of turbulence among the emerging markets and the credit goes to all who have beenparticipants in this venture of improving the financial system.                                                * Concluding remarks delivered by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, RBI at the IDRBT, Hyderabad on August 27, 20042On IDRBTAs regards the activities of IDRBT, we are heralding a customer-centric national switch forATMs. This, I believe, facilitates access to a large number of ATMs of different banks. IDRBT has takenmajor steps to herald an IT revolution in the financial sector in a brief span of about eight years. Anotherexcellent initiative is the University-Industry collaboration and both the M.Tech. Programme and thePGPBTM Programme are significant contributions. Undoubtedly, the IDRBT will have a proper balancebetween research, training and IT infrastructure provisioning for the benefit of the financial sector as awhole. India boasts of excellence in the development of computer software, and the entire world’sfinancial sector sources its software from Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, etc. Perhaps, there is somemerit in our trying to get advantage of this expertise being provided by various centres. IDRBT can play arole by creating a forum in which the software industry and the hardware industry that are setting globalstandards are able to serve the financial sector domestically also. And whatever we try to do, we have tobe very careful about the quality of services and it is hoped that IDRBT will introduce, if it has not alreadyintroduced, and also upgrade the mechanisms by which there is an assessment of the quality of servicesIDRBT is providing.RBI and TechnologySome mention of the RBI’s work with regard to technology will be in order in this forum. Animportant contribution of the RBI to the development of technology is indeed the establishment of thisInstitute. The major achievement in the last one-year is the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS).Between the timetable and making sure that it works right, we gave preference to making sure that itworks right which resulted in some delay but by and large we are on track. Within three months of theintroduction of the RTGS, the system has been able to settle almost 90% of the inter-bank funds transfer,which were being earlier routed through the net-settlement based inter-bank clearing at Mumbai.  Theyear also witnessed the introduction of what is called the Special Electronic Funds Transfer (SEFT),which provides for transfer of funds in the electronic mode on the same day basis with multiple dailysettlements. The RTGS and SEFT are together able to cover about 2500 branches of banks in around200 cities. No doubt, there is still lot of scope for further improvement.It is appropriate to mention the items on the RBI’s agenda on technology matters. One of courseis the expansion of the reach of the RTGS and what is most important is to make sure that it not onlyincreases its reach but also works well. Secondly, the National Electronic Funds Transfer needs toconnect almost all branches in the country using the SFMS and the INFINET. The third is enhancing thelevel of security in the Payment and Settlement System. We should accord the highest priority to securityin all IT-related matters, particularly in the financial sector, because they are all inter-related and ifsecurity is breached in one place, it is quite possible that this spreads into the other areas. The fourthrelates to the conduct of clearing and settlement at the national level through a national settlementsystem. Introduction of cheque truncation system on a pilot basis in the National Capital Region is animportant task. There are also some proposals related to the risk mitigation schemes for deferred netsettlements system. In this regard, we are also pursuing the idea of having a semi-autonomous Board forPayments and Settlements. Ultimately, there should be a separate legislation governing the Paymentsand Settlements System.To provide a roadmap to attain these goals, the RBI has decided to start the preparation of anew vision document on technology. The new vision document will encompass the consolidation ofprogress made and also show the way forward. As soon as the preliminary draft is prepared, we will be3able to submit it to a group of multi-disciplinary professionals, both from the user-side and thetechnology-side and it will invite your advice and guidance. This vision document will be put in the publicdomain in the draft stage itself.On the Current Macroeconomic SituationIn view of the widespread interest in the current inflationary environment, I will make a briefpresentation on the current macro-economic situation with particular reference to inflation.If you recall, a few weeks ago I had made a brief statement on the concerns relating to inflation.At that stage, it was submitted that there were both global and domestic factors working, predominantlyglobal but some domestic factors – which are driving the current inflation. I had also mentioned aboutboth the supply and demand factors and that the rise in headline inflation was predominantly a result ofsupply-shock. In terms of policy response it was indicated that (a) we are monitoring the developmentscarefully; and (b) we respond to the development on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring pricestabilityThis is as good a statement today as it was a few weeks ago.  But there are certaindevelopments since then, and it is my duty to place them before you.First, a number of fiscal actions have been taken in particular relating to oil. The impact, you maynot find the impact of these actions today or tomorrow, but it is very clear that there is a determined fiscalresponse which has been initiated and which will be continued as necessary. This should help containinflationary expectations.Second, there is a new development in Indian situation. It is that the corporate houses havetaken upon themselves the importance of maintaining certain amount of price stability. The industry andtrade have taken initiatives in terms of looking at what may be called the broader interest. In terms ofpricing power, there are occasions when the corporate sector may not use the full pricing power in theshort-run to gain immediate advantage keeping in view a longer term perspective. This realisation isevident among our corporates and I am sure it is happening among the larger trading community also.These attitudes and actions do contribute to moderating inflationary outcomes and, more importantly,expectations.Third, we had a series of discussions in the recent past with the financial industry associationsand the leading bankers. We had extremely fruitful discussions and the major advice that came forwardfrom the banking community and the financial sector is to try and reduce volatility. All of them agreed thatit is in the interest of everybody that we minimise volatility in the financial markets and in public policyminimise knee-jerk reactions, while focussing on price stability and the underlying inflation.Fourth, in the domestic circumstance, there is a truckers' strike and there are fears of strikeadding to inflation. It must be recognised that there may be some increase in the numbers relating toheadline inflation for those few weeks. I would, however, describe the truckers' strike to be in the natureof a "temporary supply disruption in certain localities" rather than something that should influence theinflationary expectations or the approach to price stability. It is this distinction that is required when weare analysing the type of policy responses.Fifth, as far as the financial markets are concerned, the money markets have been reasonablystable and the forex markets have also been stable. In the government securities market, however, therehave been certain concerns. The RBI is aware of the situation and the market participants have madeseveral suggestions to minimise volatility or adverse impact, and these are being examined at theoperational level. We in RBI are trying to see that there are no avoidable uncertainties in policy, whilemitigating undue pressures on the functioning of markets without undermining market efficiency.4Positives Getting More PositiveBut in all this, while it is true that we should be concerned about the current rise in headlineinflation, we should not forget the positive side, and in my view, the positive side seems to be getting abit more positive in the last two-to-three weeks.  How is that so?First and foremost, there is virtually a national consensus that high inflation is not good and thatit should be brought down. Whether it is political leadership, whether it is economic agents, whether it isbankers, whether it is regulators – among everybody there is a national consensus that it is not good tohave persistent highs in prices and that everybody should consider the common long-term interests inmaintaining price stability. So, there is a national consensus on the issue and several actions havefollowed from all sections wherever it was warranted and there have been no knee-jerk reactions.Second, there is good news, in the sense that generally in India democratic pressures ensurethat the inflation doesn't go above the two-digit mark. But now, we find that inflation tolerance has comedown. The society, the economic agents and the market participants are now reacting to a lowerheadline inflation, which is a good thing because if we want a sustained strong growth, it is necessary torein in inflationary expectations. It is necessary to ensure price stability and what is the best way toensure price stability? Everybody should work towards the same goal including the RBI and that ispossible when there is a consensus in this regard. There is a virtual national consensus today thattolerance to inflation has come down and that definitely people are unhappy if it is higher and so it mustbe brought below that level as soon as possible. This indeed is good news because the economic agentsare now factoring in this consensus as a possible factor governing future policies and expectationsrelating to price stability.Third, the changing scenario on interest rates is also good news. For long, we had plannedsystems and we had administered interest rates with some amount of comfort for everyone. In the lastfive to six years, we had reduction in the interest rates. As the interest rates went down and down overthe recent years, we were not fully sensitive to the fact that there is something known as interest ratecycles.  So, for the first time, the market participants have got a feel of this interest rate cycle. No doubt,the RBI has been mentioning this in its analysis, but for many it looked like the usual central bankanalysis and caution – like a grandfather always cautioning to be careful while crossing the road.But the reality of the reform process is that there will be interest rate cycles even within anoverall stable situation and consistent with overall macro-stability. That cycle is being experienced by themarket participants for the first time, with the result that the market participants are now able to inputthese uncertainties more consciously and factor the type of risk they have to face in their conduct ofbusiness. So from the central bank's point of view, it is our endeavour to facilitate – it is not ourendeavour to say we told you so – the new environment by working together to see that the appropriatesystems to withstand interest rate cycles are more consciously built. In a meeting with bankers a coupleof days ago, we have more or less come round to the view that the system should be made to getaccustomed to the interest rate cycles.Fourth, the prospects for real sector are looking better. In the current fiscal, in terms of thenumbers, the investment activity is picking up whether one talks of capital goods imports, or one talks ofcapital goods production. The off-take in the non-food credit in this fiscal has been very impressive.These developments mean that the output should in the normal course grow. So, the output is likely togrow in the next few months and that is in many ways the time-frame which we have to look at in regardto the price levels. One should recognise that ultimately inflation is the result of interplay between thesupply side such as productivity, quantum of output and investment activities, and the demand side. So, Iwould consider the supply side domestically being more positive.Fifth, as a positive, our exports are growing impressively. We are usually worried that the oil billis going up but the exports are also going up and so, at least the impact on balance of payments is notas much as we would have apprehended. Hence, we are less uncomfortable in facing the oil price hikes.5Analytics for Policy ResponseIn this background, it will be useful to look at the analytics that should govern the policyresponse.As between the international and domestic factors that influence the current tendency for a risein the headline inflation in our country, the international factors continue to be dominant. Theinternational factors relate primarily to oil but also, to some extent, other commodities and financialmarkets, including interest rates and exchange rates.  At the same time, there have been positivedevelopments on the domestic front. These relate to improved outlook on monsoon and pick up in theinvestment activity.  Clearly, therefore, the dominance of international factors in the current price rise andthe importance of stability governing domestic economy continue to warrant a measured response toensure price stability and contain inflationary expectations.As between supply and demand factors, the evidence clearly continues to be that the increase ininflation is largely on account of supply shock. As regards demand factors, the growth in broad money aswell as the reserve money has moderated. There is evidence of gradual unwinding of overhang ofliquidity. There may be some transient impact of the truckers’ strike on inflation but this need not betreated as a lasting supply shock.  In any case, there is no clear evidence that there has been anyaggravation on the demand side. On balance, therefore, while the situation has to be watched carefullyin terms of the balance between supply and demand factors, the current situation seems to be not muchdifferent than what it was diagnosed to be some time ago, viz., significantly a supply side shock.As regards inflationary expectations, there is a new dimension to the understanding of inflationitself. There is recently a sophisticated debate on the issue of appropriate index of inflation.  Analystshave pointed out that the wholesale price index (WPI) of India is similar to producers’ price index in othercountries and that in other countries, the headline inflation is usually the consumer price index (CPI).More important, internationally, empirical evidence shows that wholesale price or producers’ index tendsto be more volatile. It may be necessary to capture these nuances and their relationship with policyresponse in the context of inflationary expectations.It will be interesting to recall the experience of rise in headline inflation and divergence betweenWPI and CPI in our country. Over the last five years average WPI inflation, on a weekly basis, was 4.6per cent and CPI inflation was lower at 3.9 per cent, on a monthly basis.  In the recent years, the year-on-year WPI inflation rate was higher in the range of 6.0-9.0 per cent during most parts of 2000-01.Again, inflation remained high in the range of 6.0-7.0 per cent for sometime during 2003-04.  As theseinflationary episodes were considered to be largely caused by supply side factors, the inflation ratereversed itself quickly once the supply situation stabilised.  While the headline inflation responds to bothsupply shocks and demand pressures, the nature of response could be quite different. The response ofinflation to supply shocks is quick but transient. The response to demand shocks on the other hand, ismore subtle but persistent.  As indicated in the annual monetary and credit policy Statement for the year2001-02, a factor which complicates the conduct of monetary policy during certain periods is the difficultyin correct assessment of the potential inflationary pressures based on the available data for the currentperiod. While there are uncertainties, it is perhaps useful to look at the recent inflation history for anassessment of inflationary expectations.The monetary policy stance in other countries is also trying to respond to the oil price shock. Inmany countries there has been a shift in monetary policy stance from easy to a more neutral one. Inmost countries, there is very little evidence of cognisable monetary policy response to the oil price hikeper se. In view of the linkages between domestic and international economy, the monetary policyresponses of other countries, particularly the developed ones, have also to be carefully watched.Most important, there is a reassurance that in the context of current rise in inflation all are on thesame side, viz., on the side of price stability. The fiscal authorities, monetary policy, the financial marketsand corporates are committed to the objective of price stability and minimising volatility.  In thisbackground, therefore, RBI will continue its dialogue with market participants to fine tune its response to6minimise volatility while emphasising the importance of Reserve Bank’s credibility in maintaining pricestability consistent with the compulsions of the growth dynamics in our country at this juncture.Thank you.-----------
