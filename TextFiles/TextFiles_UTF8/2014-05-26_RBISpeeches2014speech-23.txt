@  KYC : Compliance vs Convenience   Is KYC a recent phenomenon?  KYC was always there in banking! The focus, earlier, was more on the asset side and  not on the liability side as no banker could risk parting with his funds to an unknown  person. The thorough appraisal process to screen the potential borrowers is a good  example of KYC process.   Then, issues such as illegal/black money and more recently, terrorism financing  became matters of serious concern and then KYC on payments and remittances, and  consequently on the liability side (deposit accounts, etc.) started assuming high  importance.   Why KYC/AML Norms  Sound KYC policies and procedures are critical for protecting the safety and soundness  of banks and the integrity of banking system in the country.   Due to increasing globalisation of Indian banks, their interaction with other countries'  financial systems are expanding, making the task of ensuring safety of our systems  more critical. International obligations and inter-regulatory consensus built via United  Nations Resolutions, Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Action  Task Force also require that we put in place an elaborate KYC Framework in India.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)  The FATF is an intergovernmental body established in 1989 (G-7 initiative). Its tasks are  to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and  operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other  related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. It is a policy-making  body which works to generate the necessary political will to bring about national  legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas. It monitors the progress of its  members in implementing necessary measures. There are 36 full-fledged members.     India is one of them. Over 18 jurisdictions around the world have committed to the FATF  Recommendations. India has also committed to implement the recommendations of  FATF. Originally, in 1990, FATF had 40 recommendations focussing on drug money. It  revised its recommendations in 1996 and broadened the scope.  Then in 2001, it added  eight (later nine) special recommendations to combat financing of terrorism which were  further revised in 2003. The latest exercise in 2012 had further revised the  recommendations and combined the 40+9 to 40.   @ Speech delivered by Shri R Gandhi, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at Federation of Andhra Pradesh  rd Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Hyderabad on 23 May 2014.  Assistance provided by Shri Thomas Mathew, General Manager is greatly acknowledged.  Basel Committee  Findings of an internal survey of cross-border banking in 1999 by the Basel Committee  identified deficiencies in KYC policies for banks in a large number of countries. It  constituted a Working Group on Cross-border Banking to examine the then KYC  procedures and to draw up standards applicable to banks in all countries. It issued a  consultative document, called the Customer Due Diligence for banks (CDD) in January  2001. While the FATFs focus is on money-laundering and terrorist financing, the Basel  Committee's approach to KYC is from a wider prudential, and risk-management  perspective, not just anti-money laundering perspective.  PMLA  Salient Features  UN General  Assembly  resolution (1990) calls  upon  the  Member  States to  adopt   national  money-laundering  legislation and programme. Accordingly, in India the  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 was enacted in January 2003. The  Act along with the Rules framed there under have come into force with effect from 1st  July 2005.  The objectives of the PMLA are to:    prevent and control money laundering   confiscate and seize the property obtained from the laundered money   prescribe  fines and penalties for offence   The important feature of the Act is that the burden of proof is on the accused.  Regulatory Stance  The Reserve Bank's regulatory stance on KYC is with the aim to safeguard banks from  being used by criminal elements for money laundering activities and to enable banks to  understand the risk posed by customers, products and services, delivery channels and  helping them  assess and manage their risks prudently. At the same time, the Reserve  Bank is fully conscious that the KYC framework will have to be relevant to the perceived  risk and not intrusive in nature nor too strict resulting in denial of banking services to  general public.  As far as Indian banking sector is concerned, some of the initial steps taken  (instructions issued) in respect of KYC are as under. Actually these instructions are  there for the past 50 years or so, as far back as from 1965.   1965  Banks were asked to ensure that full and correct addresses of the  depositors are recorded  (Benami accounts & avoidance of tax).  2    1976  For opening of accounts, in order to establish the identity of account  holders/avoid benami accounts, the concept of "Introduction" was prescribed.   1987 - There should be reasonable gap of say, 6 months between the time an  introducer opens his account and introduces another prospective account holder  to the bank. Introduction of an account should enable proper identification of the  person opening an account so that the person can be traced if the account is  misused.    1991 - No cash transaction above ` 50,000/- for  TCs/ DDs/MTs/TTs    1993  - Banks to keep vigil over heavy cash withdrawals by account holders  which may be disproportionate to their normal trade/business requirements and  cases of unusual trends   The banks to introduce the practice of obtaining photographs of the  depositors/account holders who are authorised to operate the said accounts at  the time of opening of all new operative accounts with effect from 1st January  1994   1995 - Monitoring & special reporting for cash transactions of value more than  `10 Lakh.   1999 - Confirmation by post from both the customer and the introducer before  issue of cheque book    2002  KYC circular   Paradigm shift   KYC prior to & post Nov 04  After the international focus on KYC, the Reserve Bank brought on a paradigm shift in  the approach to KYC by banks in India. It moved away from introduction to document  based identification - hence introduction not required. It also shifted the focus from  financial loss (from frauds) to the banks to the loss of reputation to the banks (by non- compliance). The other principles are that the KYC information collected is to be  consistent with risk perception and other information to be collected only with consent of  the customer and the KYC related information is confidential - not to be divulged for  cross-selling or any other purpose.     3   Regulatory prescriptions   Who is a Customer  a KYC context  In the context of KYC framework, the concept of "customer" has now been redefined. A  "customer" is no longer just the one who has an Account and/or business relationship  with the bank; the ones on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial  owner), the beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries, such  as Stock Brokers, Chartered Accountants, Solicitors and any person/entity connected  with any financial transaction which can pose risk to bank, say, through a wire  transfer/issue of a high value DD, etc are all "customers".  KYC policy of banks  the 4 key elements  The Reserve Bank has prescribed that the KYC policy of banks should have the  following key elements:  i.  Customer Acceptance Policy  ii. Customer Identification Procedures  iii. Monitoring of Transactions, and  iv. Risk Management  Customer Acceptance Policy  The salient features are:   No anonymous or fictitious/benami accounts to be allowed   Not to open/close accounts when unable to apply appropriate Customer Due  Diligence (CDD - decision to close a/cs to be taken at reasonably high levels  after issuing due notice to the customers).   Define parameters of risk perception to enable categorisation of customers   Documentation/information requirements for different risk categories (to prepare   a profile of each customer)   Circumstances where a customer is permitted to act on behalf of another  person/entity, should be spelt out (eg., account is operated by a mandate holder)   Identity of the customer does not match with those of criminal  backgrounds/banned entities (terrorists, etc.)     4   Customer Identification Procedures (CIP)   Customer identification - identifying the customer and verifying his/her identity by  using reliable, independent source documents, data or information.   the banks must be able to satisfy the competent authorities that due diligence  was observed based on the risk profile of the customer in compliance with the  extant guidelines in place.    Such risk-based approach is considered necessary to avoid disproportionate cost  to banks and a burdensome regime for the customers.   nature of information/documents required would also depend on the type of  customer (individual, corporate etc.)  CIP  When Customer ID is required   While establishing a banking relationship   While carrying out a financial transaction as in the case of a  Walk in Customer    When the bank has a doubt about the authenticity/veracity or the adequacy of the  previously obtained customer identification data  CIP  PMLA requirements   Banks to obtain Officially Valid Documents (OVD).    OVDs are Passport, Driving License, the Permanent Account Number (PAN)  Card, the Voters Identity Card issued by the Election Commission of India;  UIDAI letter containing name, address and Aadhaar number and NREGA Card  duly signed or any other document as may be notified by the Central  Government.   When there are suspicions of money laundering or financing of the activities  relating to terrorism/ there are doubts about the adequacy or veracity of  previously obtained customer identification data, banks should review the due  diligence measures including verifying again the identity  Banks are required to verify the identity of the customer for all international money  transfer operations  CIP  - Natural Persons (NP) - Identification Documents   PAN card, Passport, Voters Identity Card, Driving license, UIDAI Letter   Aadhaar, NREGA Card duly signed by an officer of State Govt.    5    Identity card issued by employer (subject to the banks satisfaction)   Letter from a recognized public authority or public servant verifying the id &  address (subject to the banks satisfaction)   Salaried employees  letter of identity and/or address from corporates and  enities of repute (1 officially valid document is required).  CIP - NP  Address Documents   Telephone bill    Bank account statement   Letter from any recognized public authority     Electricity bill    Ration card     Letter from employer (subject to satisfaction of the bank) if an officially valid  document is produced for identity   Rent agreement duly registered with state Govt or similar Regn. Authority  indicating the address of the customer.   Based on self-declaration, accounts could be transferred from one branch to  another without address proof (correct address proof is to be obtained by the  transferee branch within 6 months).   Any one of the documents would suffice (If address is available in ID document,  single document is sufficient).    Banks to obtain sufficient information necessary to establish, to their satisfaction,  the identity of customer and the purpose of the intended nature of banking  relationship.   Banks need to satisfy the competent authorities that due diligence was observed  based on the risk profile of the customer.   Banks have been advised to accept e-KYC service of UIDAI as a valid process  for KYC verification. The information including the photographs made available  from UIDAI as a result of e-KYC process to be treated as Officially Valid  Documents.     6   CIP - Close relatives   In respect of close relatives, e.g. wife, son, daughter and parents, etc who live  with their husband, father/mother and son, etc., banks can obtain an identity  document and a utility bill of the relative with whom the prospective customer is  living along with a declaration from the relative that the said person (prospective  customer) wanting to open an account is a relative and is staying with him/her.    Banks can use any supplementary evidence such as a letter received through  post for further verification of the address.   CIP - PEPs (Non-resident)  Politically Exposed Persons  (PEPs) are individuals who are entrusted with prominent  public functions in a foreign country (as of now, we are focusing on foreign PEPs). e.g.,  Heads of states/Govts., senior politicians, senior Govt/judicial/defence officers, senior  executives of state-owned corporations   Banks to compile all information, identity details, and details of sources of funds  before accepting a PEP as customer   Decision to open account for PEPs to be taken at a senior level as spelt out in  the policy.   Family members and close relatives of PEPs are also to be subjected to same  CDD  CIP- Non face-to-face Customers  Apart from applying the usual customer identification procedures, the following are to be  taken care of:   Certification of all the documents presented   First payment to be effected through the customer's account with another bank  with similar KYC standards.   In the case of cross-border customers involving third party  certification/introduction of the customer, the third party is to be a regulated and  supervised entity.  CIP - Unique Customer Identification Code (UCIC)   Need to ensure that customers do not have multiple identities within a bank,  across the banking system and across the financial system  7    The UCIC will help banks to identify customers, track the facilities availed,  monitor financial transactions in a holistic manner and enable banks to have a  better approach to risk profiling of customers.   Central KYC registry is under consideration  CIP - Legal Persons (LP)    Verify the legal status of the legal person/ entity through proper and relevant  documents   Verify that any person purporting to act on behalf of the legal person/entity  is so  authorized and identify and verify the identity of that person   As per PML Rules, beneficial person should be identified by banks/FIs   Understand the ownership and control structure of the customer and determine  who are the natural persons who ultimately control the legal person   CIP - LP  Beneficial Owners  Beneficial owner is the natural person who ultimately owns or controls a client and/or  the person on whose behalf transaction is being conducted. Includes a person who  exercises effective control over a juridical person.   Controlling ownership  Companies >25% shares/capital/profit; Partnership  >15% of capital/profit; Unincorporated association/body of individuals > 15% of  property/capital/profit; Trust   > = 15% interest in Trust/Settler of Trust/Anyone  exercising effective control over Trust.   In case of companies, partnerships, associations, etc., if no natural person could  be identified as above, the senior managing official would be reckoned as BO.   Where the client or the owner of controlling interest is a company listed on stock  exchange/majority owned subsidiary of such a co., not necessary to identify the  BOs of such companies.  CIP - Legal Persons  Companies  Copies of the following documents would be required:   Certificate of incorporation and Memorandum & Articles of Association   Resolution of the Board of Directors to open an account and identification of  those who have authority to operate the account   8    Power of Attorney granted, if any    Copy of PAN allotment letter   CIP - LP  Partnership Firms  Copies of the following documents would be required:   Registration certificate, if registered     Partnership deed    Power of Attorney granted    Any officially valid document identifying the partners and the PA holder and their  addresses  CIP- LP  Trusts & Foundations  Documents required are:   Certificate of registration, if registered    Trust deed   Power of Attorney granted    Any officially valid document to identify the trustees, settlors, beneficiaries, PA  holder and their address  CIP - Proprietary Concerns   Registration certificate (in case of a registered concern)    Certificate/license issued by the Municipal authorities under Shop &  Establishment Act,    Sales and Income Tax returns, CST/VAT certificate    License issued by the registering authorities like ICAI, ICoAI, Institute of  Company Secretaries, Indian Medical Council, Food and Drug Control  Authorities, etc.   Complete Income Tax return (not just the acknowledgment) in proprietors name  reflecting income from proprietary concern, duly authenticated/acknowledged by  IT authorities.   Utility bills such as electricity, water and landline telephone bills  9   Customer profile & risk categorization  Banks can effectively monitor, control and reduce their risk only if they have an  understanding of the normal and reasonable activity of the customer so that they have  the means of identifying transactions that fall outside the regular pattern of activity.  Accordingly, banks are required to build the profile for each customer based on risk  categorisation. The parameters of risk perception are: nature of business activity,  location of customer and his clients, mode of transactions, volume of turnover and the  social and financial status of the customer.  What is risk perception of customers and how it is linked to KYC?  An important feature of the current KYC regime is to obviate disproportionate cost to  banks and burdensome regime for the customers. This is ensured by putting in place a  risk graded CDD procedure, say: Low Risk, Medium risk and High Risk and appropriate  CDD level accordingly. Is risk categorisation a one time affair? No. It will be an ongoing  affair and banks should have  a system of periodical review of risk categorization of  accounts once in six months. They have to apply enhanced due diligence measures in  case of risk upgradation, which depends on customer transactions/change in profile.  Banks were required to complete the process of risk categorization and  compiling/updating profiles of all of their existing customers by end-March 2013.  Periodic updation of customer identification data - 2 & 10 years for high and low risk  respectively has also been prescribed.  Who are the Low Risk Customers? Typical examples are the salaried employees;  accounts with small balance  and  low turnover;  Govt. Deptts. & Govt. owned  companies;  regulatory and statutory bodies, etc. Who will be the High Risk Customers?  They are such as the  non-resident customers; HNIs; trusts, charities, NGOs and  organizations receiving donations; companies having close family shareholding or  beneficial ownership, firms with 'sleeping partners; politically exposed persons; non  face-to-face customers, jewellers/dealers in gold bullion and those with dubious  reputation as per public information available, etc.  Can a bank refuse to open an account or decide to close an existing account? Yes.   When the bank is unable to apply appropriate customer due diligence measures, i.e.,  Bank is unable to verify the identity and /or obtain documents required as per the risk  categorisation due to non-cooperation of the customer or non-reliability of the  data/information furnished to the bank. Decision to close an account at high level after  due notice to the customer.      10   Monitoring of Transactions  Banks are required to closely examine the transactions in order to ensure that they are  consistent with their knowledge of the client, his business and risk profile and where  necessary, the source of funds. Banks are also required to prescribe threshold limits for  a particular category of accounts and pay particular attention to the transactions which  exceed these limits. Banks have to particularly guard against the Money Mules  the  innocent recruits or persons with fake documents.  Suspicious Transactions  Transactions falling outside the regular, normal and reasonable pattern of activity of the  customer will be regarded as suspicious transactions. Unusually large transactions and  all unusual patterns which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose in  regard to customer's proclaimed business/income activity and transactions that involve  large amounts of cash, inconsistent with the normal and expected activity of the  customer will qualify to be suspicious transactions. Banks are required to be vigilant  about these transactions.   As per PMLA, Suspicious Transactions are that which:   gives rise to a reasonable ground of suspicion that it may involve the proceeds of  crime; or    appear to be made in circumstances of unusual or unjustified complexity; or    appear to have no economic rationale or bonafide purpose or   raise suspicions involving financing of terrorism.  Hence, the banks are required to prescribe threshold limits for a particular category of  accounts, to pay special attention to the transactions which exceed these limits  and to  set key indicators for accounts, taking note of the background of the customer, such as  the country of origin, sources of funds, the type of transactions involved and other risk  factors.   Banks are required to report such transactions (STRs) as per definition in PMLA.   Combating Financing of Terror  Banks are to develop suitable mechanism for enhanced monitoring of accounts  suspected of having terrorist links and swift identification of the transactions and making  suitable reports to FIU-Ind on priority. STRs should include suspected cases of terrorist  financing. Banks have to be particularly aware of the UNSCR enlisted individuals and  11   entities and  accounts and transactions are to be monitored vis--vis the list. Any  matching found is to be advised to MHA (UAPA  Section 51A).  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA)  Govt is empowered to freeze, seize or attach funds/financial assets of persons engaged  in or suspected to be engaged in terrorism. Under UAPA, RBI forwards the list of  individuals/entities subject to UN sanctions to banks. Banks are required to ensure  expeditious & effective implementation of the procedure of UAPA for freezing/unfreezing  of financial assets.  Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)  FIU-India has been set up pursuant to PMLA. This is a central agency to collect, collate  and analyze financial information. It also disseminates information to concerned  investigating authorities, if need be. It receives CTR/STR from banks/FIs and from  entities regulated by SEBI/IRDA.  The following types of transactions are to be reported to FIU-IND:   All cash transactions of the value of more than ` 10 Lakh or its equivalent in  foreign currency   All series of cash transactions integrally connected to each other amounting to `  10 Lakh in a month   All cash transactions where forged or counterfeit currency notes or bank notes  have been used as genuine or forgery of valuable security or document has  taken place   All suspicious transactions whether or not made in cash   All receipts by Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) of ` 10 Lakh and above   Cross-border Wire Transfer Report (CWTR) is required to be filed by 15th of  succeeding month for all cross border wire transfers of the value of more than  five lakh rupees or its equivalent in foreign currency where either the origin or  destination of fund is in India.  Customer Convenience  We are aware of the possibility that some of these guidelines can be irritating,  burdensome to comply with. Several representations and feedback were received to  that effect as well. The Reserve Bank therefore periodically reviews these instructions  and modifies them, with a view to reduce the burden and bring in ease of compliance,  12   but at the same time ensuring the safety of the financial system and the sanctity of  financial transactions are not compromised.  Some of these modifications and adjustments are as follows:   Any one of the various documents listed would suffice for the identification and  address purposes ie one for identification and another one for address; If  address is available in ID document, single document is sufficient.    e-KYC service of UIDAI as a valid process for KYC verification. The information  including the photographs made available from UIDAI as a result of e-KYC  process to be treated as Officially Valid Documents.   In respect of close relatives, e.g. wife, son, daughter and parents, etc. who live  with their husband, father/mother and son, etc., banks can obtain an identity  document and a utility bill of the relative with whom the prospective customer is  living along with a declaration from the relative that the said person (prospective  customer) wanting to open an account is a relative and is staying with him/her.    Banks can use any supplementary evidence such as a letter received through  post for further verification of the address.   Financial Inclusion  We faced challenges in promoting financial inclusion with this KYC framework. Many of  the financially excluded may not have proper official document, especially that of  address as in the case of migrant people.   As per Customer Acceptance Policy guidelines, the CAP and its implementation should  not be too restrictive, and must not result in denial of banking service to public,  especially to those who are financially or socially disadvantaged. Banks have been  advised not to deny public access to banking services, taking the indicative list of  documents as an exhaustive list.  What could be done if required documents are not available?  We have special provision for close family members as mentioned earlier. Small  Accounts could be opened by those who do not have the prescribed documents. Small  Accounts can be opened with a form filled up & signed before the bank officer with self- attested photograph  bank officer to certify. The small accounts will have the following  features: they will have limitations on credit/debit/balance; will be available only at CBS- enabled branches; no foreign remittances will be permitted; will be available only for 12  months  further extension on application for Officially Valid Document; the aggregate of  all credits in a financial year does not exceed ` One lakh; the aggregate of all  13   withdrawals and transfers in a month does not exceed ` ten thousand, and the balance  at any point of time does not exceed ` fifty thousand.  Additional documents + AEPS   Documents such as Aadhaar letter & NREGA Card are officially valid documents   for identity and address proof.   Aadhaar Enabled Payment System or AEPS developed by National Payments  Corporation of India allows a person with an Aadhaar number to carry out  financial transaction on a Micro-ATM provided by the Banking correspondent.   With AEPS, the account holders will be able to make balance enquiry, cash  withdrawal, cash deposit and Aadhaar to Aadhaar funds transfer.  To Conclude  Do we need such elaborate structure? Is it not taking the question of safety too far? Are  we paranoid about terrorism and money laundering? Why we have to put ordinary  customers of banks to such greater and deeper requirements?  These are legitimate questions that can arise in your mind. But, we have to remember  that we are responsible citizens; we have to not only abide by the law, but also help  enforcing the law. We are also a responsible nation among the international community.  We have obligations to the rest of the world as well.   This KYC structure built by us is not of our own only; it is based on the consensual  approach by all the committed nations. It is for the general good of the citizens of the  world.   We seek the understanding and the cooperation of all bank customers in complying with  the KYC requirements on an ongoing basis. No security comes free of cost or  inconvenience. That said, it will be our continued endeavour to minimize such cost and  inconvenience. Reserve Bank is committed to ease of operations by bank customers,  while requiring the banks to be vigilant about nefarious designs of anti-social elements  and terrorists to use the banking and financial systems.    &&&&&&&&&&&&&      14
