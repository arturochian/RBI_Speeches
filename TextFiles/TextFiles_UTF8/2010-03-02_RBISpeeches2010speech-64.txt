       Monetary Policy Framework in India:   ? Experience with Multiple-Indicators Approach   Deepak Mohanty    nd  I am honoured to deliver the 2 Professor Baidyanath Mishra Lecture.   Prof. Mishra is a multi-faceted personality: an economist, an educationist  and an institution-builder. Above all, he is a great teacher who inspired  generations of students. I thank the Orissa Economic Association for giving  me this opportunity.  2. I will set out how the framework of monetary policy has evolved over  the last two and half decades. First, I will touch upon the objectives of  monetary policy and then discuss briefly about how monetary framework  has evolved globally before dwelling on the Indian experience. I will  conclude with an overall assessment of the monetary policy regime in India.            I. Objectives of Monetary Policy   3. Central banks derive their objectives from their respective mandates.  Monetary policy could have either a single objective of price stability or  multiple objectives besides price stability. In the literature and in practice,  price stability is considered as the dominant objective of monetary policy.  4. The preamble to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 delineates the  basic functions of the Bank as to regulate the issue of Bank notes and  keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and  generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its  advantage. The objectives of monetary policy evolved from this broad  guideline as maintaining price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit  to the productive sectors of the economy.  In practice, monetary policy                                                    ?

The question is how do we define price stability? Price stability does  not mean zero inflation. It is considered as a low and stable order of  inflation. This is because both high inflation and deflation impose costs on  the economy by way of loss of output and misallocation of resources. For  advanced economies, an inflation rate of about 2 per cent is equated with  price stability. For an emerging market economy (EME) like India, going  through significant structural changes, a slightly higher rate of inflation  which allows relative prices to adjust smoothly can be considered  appropriate. The Chakravarty Committee (1985) had defined an inflation  rate of 4 per cent per annum as tolerable for India.    6. India is a moderate inflation country with the long-term average  inflation rate remaining in a single digit of about 7.5 per cent since 1970-71.  Over this 40-year period, the average inflation rate, however, has decelerated  to about 5.5 per cent in the decade of 2000s. The medium term objective of  monetary policy is to bring down the average inflation rate to around 3.0 per  1 cent consistent with India's integration with the global economy.   7. While a low level of inflation is essential to sustain high levels of  growth, it is not sufficient to maintain financial stability, as has been  demonstrated by the recent global financial crisis. Consequently, besides  price stability, ensuring orderly conditions in the financial markets has  become a key policy concern. In this context, it may be indicated that  financial stability had emerged as another important objective of monetary  policy in India much before the crisis. Thus, monetary policy in India has  evolved to have multiple objectives of price stability, financial stability and  growth.  These objectives are not inherently contradictory, rather mutually                                                    1  Reserve Bank of India(2010),  Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for the year 2009-10,  Reserve Bank of India, January 29, 2010.  2   reinforcing.  Price and financial stability are important for sustaining high  levels of growth which is the ultimate objective of public policy.    II. Evolution of Monetary Policy Framework   8. In order to attain the objectives of policy it is necessary to have a  consistent policy framework. At a theoretical level, the evolution of  monetary framework could be traced to the desire to reduce inflationary bias  in the economy through various refinements under the broader debate on  'rules' versus 'discretion' in policy making, and more recently, 'constrained  discretion' which believes that the doctrines of 'rules' and 'discretion' are not  2 mutually exclusive . In practice, the nature of the framework is contingent  upon two important considerations. First, the level of development of  financial markets and institutions; and second, the degree of openness of the  economy to trade and capital flows. In India, like most other countries, the  monetary policy framework has evolved in response to and in consequence  of financial developments and shifts in the underlying transmission  mechanism.    How did monetary policy framework evolve globally?    9.  In order to achieve the objectives of monetary policy which are not  under the direct control of central banks, monetary authorities typically set  'intermediate targets, which bear a stable relationship with the overall  3 objectives of monetary policy . The selection of intermediate target is also  conditional upon the channels of monetary transmission - the process  through which monetary policy actions impact the ultimate objectives.  Historically, although credit targets were prevalent, the concept of a formal  intermediate target emerged with the monetarist emphasis on money  targeting in an environment of worsening inflation in the 1970s and                                                    2  Bernanke, Ben S.

(1990), "Targets and Instruments of Monetary Policy". In B. Friedman and F. Hahn  (eds.) Handbook of Monetary Economics, Amsterdam, North-Holland.    3   observed stable relationship among money, output and prices. A number of  major central banks such as Switzerland, Germany, Japan, the UK, the USA,  France, Australia and Canada adopted monetary targets in the mid-1970s. In  the 1980s, financial market innovations reduced the need for financial  intermediation by the banking system and in turn began to impart volatility  to the behaviour of monetary aggregates. The consequent weakening of the  stable relationship among money, output and prices made many advanced  country central banks to move towards signaling monetary policy stance  through setting of interest rates. Monetary targeting, however, continued in  some form in many bank-based economies in continental Europe such as  Germany, France and Switzerland where it was possible to establish money  demand stability with redefinition of monetary aggregates.   10. Given the under-developed nature of financial markets coupled with the  quantity-based credit channel of monetary transmission, money target was  considered suitable in case of developing countries. In the 1980s, monetary  targeting was adopted in many developing countries such as Brazil, China,  Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Russia and Venezuela.  As  financial innovations spread to developing countries and they became more  open to external capital flows, monetary targeting proved less effective.   11. The weakening of monetary targeting framework, both in advanced and  developing countries, triggered a search for alternate monetary frameworks.  As it was also widely recognised that monetary policy can contribute to  sustainable growth by maintaining price stability, beginning with New  Zealand in 1989, a number of advanced and developing countries moved to  inflation targeting. Under this approach, central banks target the final  objective, i.e., inflation itself rather than targeting any intermediate variable.  Among the major central banks, the Bank of England (BoE) formally  adopted inflation targeting in 1992.   4   12. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) follows a more eclectic approach, which  can be termed as risk management approach, in pursuit of its twin objectives  of price stability and maximum employment. Under the risk management  approach, the Fed takes a policy view on interest rate on consideration of  balance of risks to inflation and growth.  Although the European Central  Bank (ECB) has a single mandate of price stability, it is not an inflation  targeting central bank. Its policy decisions are based on a two pillars  strategy comprising of economic analysis and monetary analysis. Money  supply continues to be an important variable in its analytical tool under the  second pillar reflecting the enduring influence of the German Bundesbank  which was a major monetary targeting central bank. Notwithstanding the  difference in approach among central banks, price stability is accepted as the  predominant objective of monetary policy.   How did monetary policy framework evolve in India?    13. In India also, monetary policy framework has undergone significant  transformation over time. In the 1960s, as inflation was considered to be  structural and inflation volatility was mainly caused by agricultural failures,  there was greater reliance on selective credit controls.  The aim was to     regulate bank advances to sensitive commodities to influence production  outlays, on the one hand and to limit possibilities of speculation, on the  other. In the 1970s, there was a surge in inflation on account of monetary  expansion induced by expansionary fiscal policies besides the oil price  shocks. By the early 1980s, there was a broad agreement on the primary  causes of inflation. It was argued that while fluctuations in agricultural  prices and oil price shocks did affect prices, sustained inflation since the  early 1960s could not have occurred unless it was supported by the  continuous excessive monetary expansion generated by the large-scale  4 monetisation of the fiscal deficit .                                                     4  Reserve Bank of India (2005), Report on Currency and Finance 2003-04, pp 53-79.  5   14. Against the backdrop, the Committee to Review the Working of the  Monetary System (Chairman: Prof. Sukhamoy Chakravarty; 1985), set up by  the Reserve Bank, recommended a monetary targeting framework to target  an acceptable order of inflation in line with desired output growth. It also  recommended for limiting monetary expansion through the process of  monetisation of fiscal deficit by an agreement between the Reserve Bank  5 and the Government. With empirical evidence supporting reasonable  stability in the demand function for money, broad money (M ) formally  3 emerged as an intermediate target. Under this approach, a monetary  projection is made consistent with the expected real GDP growth and a  6 tolerable level of inflation . The framework was, however, a flexible one  allowing for various feedback effects. Moreover, money supply target was  7 relatively well understood by the public at large.   15. With the pace of trade and financial liberalization gaining momentum  following the initiation of structural reforms in the early 1990s, the efficacy  of broad money as an intermediate target of monetary policy came under  question. The Reserve Bank's Monetary and Credit Policy for the First Half  of 1998-99 observed that financial innovations emerging in the economy  provided some evidence that the dominant effect on the demand for money  in the near future need not necessarily be real income, as in the past.   16. Since the mid-1990s, apart from dealing with the usual supply shocks,  monetary policy had to increasingly contend with external shocks emanating  from swings in capital flows, volatility in the exchange rate and global  business cycles. Subsequently, increase in liquidity emanating from capital  inflows raised the ratio of net foreign assets (NFA) to Reserve Money (Chart  1). This rendered the control of monetary aggregates more difficult.                                                    5  But it took almost twelve years to fructify when automatic monetization through ad hoc Treasury Bills  was abolished and a system of Ways and Means Advances (WMA) was introduced in 1997.   6  Technically,  in a simple form, if expected real GDP growth is 6 per cent, the income elasticity of  demand for money is 1.5 and a tolerable level of inflation is 5 per cent, the broad money (M ) expansion  3 target can be set at 14 per cent (M growth = 1.5 x 6 + 5 = 14%).  3  7  Rangarajan, C. (1997), Role of Monetary Policy, Economic and Political Weekly, December 27.  6   Consequently, there was also increasing evidence of changes in the  underlying transmission mechanism of monetary policy with interest rate  8 and the exchange rate gaining importance vis--vis quantity variables. Bank  credit to private sector as a per cent of GDP also started rising, though it still  remains low as compared to advanced economies and many EMEs  underscoring the potential for greater credit penetration (Table 1). These  developments necessitated refinements in the conduct of monetary policy.

Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank formally adopted a multiple  indicators approach in April 1998 with a greater emphasis on rate channels  for monetary policy formulation.  As a part of this approach, information  content from a host of quantity variables such as money, credit, output,  trade, capital flows and fiscal position as well as from rate variables such as  rates of return in different markets, inflation rate and exchange rate are  analyzed for drawing monetary policy perspectives. The multiple-indicators  approach, as conceptualised when Dr. Bimal Jalan was the Governor,  continued to evolve and was augmented by forward looking indicators and a  panel of parsimonious time series models. The forward looking indicators  are drawn from the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey, capacity  utilization survey, professional forecasters survey and inflation expectations  8   9 survey . The assessment from these indicators and models feed into the  projection of growth and inflation. Simultaneously, the Reserve Bank also  gives the projection for broad money (M ), which serves as an important  3 information variable, so as to make the resource balance in the economy  consistent with the credit needs of the government and the private sector.  Thus, the current framework of monetary policy can be termed as an  augmented multiple indicators approach as illustrated below (Exhibit 1).

This large panel of indicators is at times criticised as a 'check list'  approach, as it does not provide for a clearly defined nominal anchor for  monetary policy. However, given the level of financial market development,  the evolving nature of monetary transmission and the need to maintain the  resource balance between the government and the private sector, monetary  policy assessment becomes inherently complex.                                                    9  Following the recommendations of the Reserve Banks Working Group on Surveys (Chairman: Deepak  Mohanty; 2009), the results of some of the surveys such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters and  Industrial Outlook Survey are disseminated in the public domain (www.rbi.org.in).   9   19. Globally, it is now recognised that the task of monetary management  has become more challenging. In view of central banks operating in an  environment of high uncertainty regarding the functioning of the economy as  well as its prevailing state and future developments, a single model or a  limited set of indicators may not be a sufficient guide for monetary policy.  Instead, an encompassing and integrated set of data is required. This  reinforces the usefulness of monitoring a number of macroeconomic  indicators in the conduct of monetary policy. In the context of the recent  crisis, it is argued that monitoring money and credit may help policymakers  interpret asset market developments and draw implications from them for the  10 economic and financial outlook. There is a need to raise awareness in the  central banking community of the importance of monetary analysis and its  11 implications, both for economies individually and globally. Thus, there is  now increasing support for a broad-based approach to monetary policy.  III. Experience with Monetary Framework in India  Experience with Monetary Targeting Approach  12 20. An earlier paper examined the experience with the monetary targeting  approach. Despite the adoption of formal monetary targeting, no specific  money targets were set during the period 1985-90 except for fixing a ceiling  linked to average growth of broad money (M ) in previous year(s). This was  3 because there continued to be large overhang of excess liquidity due to  primary money creation. The biggest impediment to explicit monetary  targeting was the fact that the Reserve Bank had no controls over its credit to  the central government, which accounted for the bulk of the creation of  reserve money. The Reserve Bank could at best set limits on the secondary                                                    10  Goodhart, C (2007) Whatever Became of the Monetary Aggregate?

As a result, CRR  reached its prescribed ceiling of 15 per cent of net demand and time  liabilities (NDTL) of banks in July 1989 and the SLR reached the peak of  38.5 per cent in September 1990. Despite these measures, however, money  supply growth remained high, which contributed to inflation. The setting of  monetary targets and actual achievements during the monetary targeting  period is presented below in Table 2.

The process of financial liberalization and deregulation of interest rates  introduced since the early 1990s enhanced the role of market forces in the  determination of interest rates and the exchange rate. Accordingly, the  Reserve Bank placed greater emphasis on the money market as the focal  point for the conduct of monetary policy and for fostering its integration  with other market segments. Following the Narsimham Committee (1998)  recommendations, the Reserve Bank introduced the liquidity adjustment  facility (LAF) in June 2000 to manage market liquidity on a daily basis and  also to transmit interest rate signals to the market. Collateralized borrowing  and lending operations (CBLO) was introduced as a new money market  instrument in January 2003. The call money market was transformed into a  pure inter-bank market by August 2005 in a phased manner.   22. As a result, the money market developed significantly over the years as  reflected in increased turnover in various market segments (Table 3).  Along  with developing money markets, the Reserve Bank has also undertaken  various measures to develop the government securities and foreign exchange  market, increasing the depth of the financial markets (Chart 2).

All these reforms have also led to improvements in liquidity  management operations by the Reserve Bank as reflected in general  containment of call rates within the LAF corridor except occasional  volatility. Apart from imparting stability in call money rates, this has also  resulted in greater market integration as reflected in close co-movement of  rates in various segments of the money market (Chart 3). The rule-based  fiscal policy pursued under the Financial Responsibility and Budget  Management (FRBM) Act, by easing fiscal dominance, contributed to  overall improvement in monetary management.

During the recent period, the issue of managing large and persistent  capital inflows in excess of the absorptive capacity of the economy added  another dimension to the liquidity management operations. Initially, the  liquidity impact of large capital inflows were sterilised through open market  operation (OMO) sales and LAF operations. Given the finite stock of  government securities in the Reserve Banks portfolio and the legal  restrictions on issuance of its own paper, additional instruments other than  LAF were needed to contain liquidity of a more enduring nature. This led to  the introduction of the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) in April 2004.  Under this scheme, short term government securities were issued but the  amount remained impounded in the Reserve Banks balance sheet for  sterilisation purposes. Interestingly, in the face of reversal of capital flows  during the recent crisis, unwinding of such sterilised liquidity under the MSS  helped to ease liquidity conditions (Chart 4).

The efficient conduct of monetary policy is judged ultimately in terms  of its ability to stabilise real economic activity and inflation and also  ensuring financial stability consistent with the policy objectives. An  14   assessment of the multiple indicators approach for the period 1998-99 to  2008-09 reveals that actual outcome of GDP growth has been generally  higher than the projections indicated in the monetary policy statements,  while it has generally been lower in case of inflation (Table 4).

Overall Assessment  26. The monetary policy framework in India has undergone significant  shifts from a monetary targeting regime to a multiple indicators regime.  Such a transition was conditioned by the developments of financial markets,  increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy and  changing transmission of monetary policy.  The multiple indicators  approach, conceptualized in 1998, has since been augmented by forward  looking indicators from surveys and a panel of time series models.  Moreover, the multiple indicators approach continues to evolve. Though the  15   multiple indicators approach is subject to criticism for the absence of a  clearly defined anchor, in the wake of the recent global financial crisis there  is recognition of the usefulness of a broad indicators-based assessment of  monetary policy.   27. On the basis of the above assessment, I will give a comparison of the  relative performance of the monetary regimes in terms of key  macroeconomic variables over three periods: (i) the decade preceding the  monetary targeting period (1976-85); (ii) monetary targeting period (1986- 98) and (iii) multiple indicators period so far (1999-2009) (Table 5).

From this overall assessment, the following broad conclusions can be  drawn.   First, real GDP growth, on an average, has improved successively from  4.6 per cent in the decade prior to the monetary targeting period to 5.5  per cent in the monetary targeting period and further to 7.1 per cent in the  multiple indicators period. Not only growth has improved but it has  become more stable under the multiple indicators approach.    Second, headline WPI inflation, on an average, increased during the  monetary targeting regime alongside significant increase in fiscal deficit,  13 although there was a reduction in volatility in inflation . Under the  multiple indicators approach, both WPI and CPI inflation fell  significantly. The fall in inflation was accompanied by substantial  reduction in fiscal deficit. This underscores the importance of fiscal  consolidation to sustain higher levels of growth with price stability.    Third, while the volatility of WPI inflation reduced during the multiple  indicators period, it increased for CPI inflation reflecting higher volatility  in food prices. This underlines the importance of supply management and  a greater focus on agricultural development to contain food price  inflation.   Fourth, money supply (M ) growth declined over the regimes though  3 volatility of M increased slightly during the multiple indicators regime  3 reflecting emerging importance of interest rate in monetary transmission.  The shift in operating objective to stabilise overnight interest rate so that  it transmits through the term structure is reflected in a discernible  reduction in the overnight interest rate with lower volatility.                                                      13  It may, however, be noted that in the pre-monetary targeting period, higher inflation volatility was  also significantly contributed by the two major oil price shocks.    17    Fifth, exchange rate, on an average, has depreciated successively both in  nominal and real terms. However, it has become more stable during the  multiple indicators approach than the monetary targeting regime. This  could be partly attributed to accumulation of reserves and management of  exchange rate to contain volatility.   Sixth, the improved performance of monetary policy was facilitated by  supportive fiscal policy  discontinuation of the practice of automatic  monetisation and rule-based deficit reduction programme under the  Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act  which  enhanced instrument independence of the Reserve Bank.   Finally, the recent overall improvement in macroeconomic performance  cannot be ascribed to monetary policy alone. Apart from a rule-based  fiscal policy, productivity enhancing structural reforms, sharp increase in  saving and investment, increasing integration with the global economy, a  low global inflation environment and the unleashing of the  entrepreneurial spirit of the private sector played an important role.       18
