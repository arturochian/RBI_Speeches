1By1. I am very happy to be here today to inaugurate the VSAT-based communicationnetwork. Undoubtedly this is a formal occasion but also an occasion that opens a new chapterin the history of India’s banking technology. I am also happy that this event marks the veryfirst major successful project undertaken by the Institute for Development and Research inBanking Technology (IDRBT). Let me also take this opportunity to express my deepappreciation of the efforts put in by the professionals of IDRBT, RBI and the Hughes Escorts2. Recent developments the world over have brought into sharp focus the important rolepayment systems play in the development of the financial sector. The Reserve Bank of Indiahas given high priority to bringing about efficient payment systems as one of the centralbanking functions. In fact, the design, management, regulation and supervision ofelectronically based payment systems would soon become the major focal points of policydeliberations in our country. We, in the Reserve Bank, are moving inexorably towards the3. The Indian banking and financial scene witnessed dramatic changes in recent years,partly due to the thrust of liberalisation and partly due to the dynamism imparted byinnovative ideas and products. The main driving force of such heightened activity is the needto provide first class service to customers of banks and other financial entities at affordablecosts. And customers, on their part, have also become sophisticated and have articulated veryconvincingly of their needs and the appreciation they have for prompt and value-addedservice. Banks therefore, have devoted considerable attention to the processes that help theirproducts to be acceptable. Technology provided the key to such processes. In the last fewyears, it is no wonder that the banking sector has seen a virtual cornucopia of new products:credit cards, -banking, ATMs, quick collection facilities for outstation , retailEFT, Electronic Clearing Services – ECS – Debit and Credit for repetitive payments likedividend, interest, utility bills, Internet Banking, etc. Now there are indications of movingtowards the introduction of smart cards, debit cards, on-line banking for e-commerce andfinancial EDI for straight through processing.4. On its part, the Reserve Bank has initiated many reforms to further the speed andreliability of financial operations and to contain financial risks of the system, through thecarrier of information technology. The RBI has, over the years, given guidance on theintroduction and spread of computerisation in banks. Since about the early eighties, a numberof Committees set up by RBI have given their recommendations on various issues relating to including the feasibility of introducing MICR / OCR technology for chequeprocessing,  in the banking industry, communication network for banks andSWIFT implementation,  in banks, technology issues relating to paymentssystem, cheque clearing and securities settlement in the banking industry. Electronic fundstransfer and other electronic payments are being developed. The banking sector has                                                         1 Inaugural Address by Shri S. P.

It is also becoming increasingly obvious that computers andcommunications are essential to revolutionise the very nature of payment products, their5. Computerisation efforts among the Public Sector Banks ( PSBs) in India, whichaccount for over 80% of the assets of the entire banking system, has been substantial. Of the45,439 branches of the PSBs as on September 30, 1998, as many as 3,668 branches servingcustomers directly had been fully computerised with a complement of more than 65,000computer nodes/PCs. A total of 6961 branches have been partially computerised – withAdvanced Ledger Posting Machines, Electronic Accounting Machines and PersonalComputers. Of the 336 service branches, 149 had been fully computerised and 166 had beencomputerised.6. The PSBs had installed 194 Automated Teller machines (ATMs) all over the country;they had issued over 8.5 lakh credit cards and  over 32,000 debit cards. The latest in this areaof activity has been the issue of SMART cards.7. For international interconnectivity of computers and for cross-border transactions, 568branches have been connected to the S.W.I.F.T. Internal interconnectivity of branches hasbeen established at 571 branches using internal captive networks while148 branches are on8. All the data which I provided now reveal the extent of computerisation in the bankingindustry. Time has now come to consolidate the efforts of computerisation by banks. Tillrecently, the computerisation efforts of banks have been, by and large, branch centric.Computerisation of activities performed at branches has been the target for improvingefficiency and productivity. The focus now, as I mentioned earlier is on improved customerservice. Inter-linking the computers at various branches has become the need of the hour.While I must accept that some initiatives have been taken in this direction, the INFINETwould give the much required fillip in enabling information flow across branches of banks.INFINET would thus be the backbone for transmission of messages, information, data and9. The initiative of the Reserve Bank in setting up the Institute for Development andResearch in Banking Technology (IDRBT) and the Indian Financial Network (INFINET)using satellite-based VSAT technology, in co-ordination with the public sector banks andIDRBT has now succeeded. Today is the proud moment for the entire banking and financialsector, as the INFINET is being inaugurated. It is a project to which we have devoted a greatdeal of our time, attention and resources for almost the last two years. The INFINET standsfor our commitment to utilise the best of leading edge technology to enable the bankingsector to achieve international standards. With the operationalisation of the INFINET, one ofthe biggest bottlenecks of our times, namely the lack of connectivity of banks, would beeased to a great extent.10. Very Small Aperture Terminals ( VSATs) have been installed in all the sixteen officesof the Banking Department of the Reserve Bank, at the Ministry of Finance in New Delhi andat selected sites of the public sector banks. For the present, the use of the network will belimited by the constraint of the transponder space allocation. The one-eighth of transponder2funds for the entire banking sector in the country,the RBINET.partially clearing and settlement.space allocated on extended C-band on INSAT 2B would need to be expanded, as userinstitutions put more applications on the network and as more institutions join the INFINETUser Group. The demand for communication bandwidth will increase as the users find theutility of the network to be immense, and it would therefore be necessary to eventually get awhole transponder to be allocated for purposes of networking. I believe that the network willincrease so quickly that the sooner the transponder space is increased the better it will be forthe financial sector as a whole.11. As we look back at the processes we adopted to get to the stage at which we aretoday, one important point would strike as critical. When a Closed User Group for theINFINET was formed in July 98 with representatives of the RBI, IDRBT, IBA and arepresentative of each of the Public Sector banks who are members of the network, we took amomentous decision. For, the INFINET User Group would be required to address issues suchas the inter-bank applications, design and development of message formats, preparations fortest mode and the various issues which may arise during the implementation of the project.The User Group has, through smaller and more focused Working Groups and Sub-groups,been working on these issues and the work on identification of inter-bank applications, designand development of message formats, appointment of a consultant and sizing up of hardwareand software requirements is at an advanced stage of completion. One important aspect onwhich the Reserve Bank has been concentrating, and on which all bankers will have to attachutmost priority, is standardisation. The standardisation of hardware, operating systems,platforms and application software throughout the banking industry is a necessary condition12. Why has the Reserve Bank attached so much significance to this project? TheINFINET will help to optimise the funds flow management by banks, aid decision making,enable faster reporting of Government Account transactions and flow of Government funds,and improve customer service all around. As economic activity grows, there would be a needfor speedier funds flow and safer channels for its transmission. Satellite communication13. The provision of a country-wide network is only the beginning. For effective andutilisation of the INFINET, 14. The INFINET would give impetus to bank computerisation to cover bulk of bankingbusiness and to interface with the banking system. The computerisation now available in thebanking sector will give added emphasis on standardisation of Hardware, Operating systemsoftware, software – which would all help in better housekeeping. Because housekeepingitself would more or less get standardised for the entire banking sector. Interconnectivitywould ensure optimal utilisation of funds and also availability of VSAT – not only for fundstransfer but also for information flow which would result in better supervision, monitoring at15. All major bank branches in commercially important cities of India should be broughtunder total computerisation as expeditiously as possible. The next step is the linking of allcomputerised branches to their service branches, Treasury / Funds departments andcontrolling offices. Connectivity to Treasury / Funds department will ensure optimalutilisation of funds and connectivity to controlling offices will aid in empirical decisionmaking. All banks should aim at putting in place such intra-bank hierarchical networks. Onceintra-bank connectivity is complete, and with inter-bank connectivity being provided by the3the level of controlling offices, and decision making at the corporate level.computerisation of bank branches is imperative. optimal on both counts, speed and security. scores over traditional terrestrial modes for the payment system reform to take-off successfully.INFINET, more than 70 per cent of banking business can have the advantage of access to an16. Against the background of the incipient use of new technologies, the Reserve Bankappointed in September 1998 a Committee on Technology Upgradation in the BankingSector, with membership drawn from the Government, the RBI, banks and academicinstitutions associated with information technology. The main purpose of the Committee wasto examine the scope and methods for technological upgradation in the banks and financialinstitutions, and the associated aspects such as suggestions for legislative amendments,establishment of standards related to platforms, messages, security, etc. Therecommendations given by the Committee cover various areas such as communicationinfrastructure and usage of the INFINET, standardisation and security, outsourcing ofcomputerisation of Government transactions, data warehousing, datamining, management information systems, legal framework for electronic banking and other17. As the central bank, one of the primary concerns of the Reserve Bank is the operationof a safe and efficient payment system for the efficient conduct of monetary policy. In amodern economy, the link between economic activity and money is effected through thepayment process whose efficiency is determined largely by the efficiency of the paymentsystem. Inefficiencies in the payment process create time lags between the initiation and thecompletion of a payment transaction. By providing a means for quick, safe and efficientmovement of funds and information, INFINET would help to improve the effectiveness of18. While I have concentrated on the impact that INFINET would have on the futurepayment systems in the country, I would also like to add the benefits that INFINET wouldbring on other areas of usage. I envisage the usage of the INFINET backbone for informationexchange between banks – for example, credit information on borrowers’ accounts could beshared among banks to their mutual advantage. Information which is essential formanagement to take decisions on various matters, perpetuation of guidelines, circulars etc.,would all be transmitted through the INFINET. Inter-bank communication which some timestends to take a long duration could get completed very quickly over the INFINET.Transmission of data for warehousing purposes, and for the requirement of RBI for offsitesurveillance, information to controlling offices from branches – these are all some of the19. The INFINET by its very logic has no constraints on its reach. As we liberalise thefinancial system and bring about integration of different markets, both within and outside thecountry, payment transactions will not just be confined only to our borders. Cross-bordertransactions will increase sharply. The vision for tomorrow encompasses both domestic andinternational sectors being served by the INFINET. I can visualise that in the not-too-distantfuture, a seamless integration of markets, with funds and data flowing without any delays andsettlements effected without lags and large value funds transfers taking place on a real timeon-line basis .  All these developments, taking place with the aid of technology, will providesatisfaction to the ultimate users of our services. And we are all here sharing and working forthe common objective of serving our customers. Let us therefore re-dedicate ourselves to theThank you.4task and work towards expansion and best use of the INFINET.areas which would work using the INFINET.monetary policy.related issues.
