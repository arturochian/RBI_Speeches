The Role of Financial Education:1The Indian CaseDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,I am thankful to Shri Swarup for inviting me to this august gathering. The Conferencerepresents an important step by the Pension Fund Regulatory and DevelopmentAuthority (PFRDA) to distil from the experiences of other countries in its quest forenhancing the levels of financial education in our country. The collaboration withOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which has beenplaying a pivotal role in this respect is a laudable idea which will certainly contribute tofurthering the cause of financial education. The eminence of several speakers addsgreat value to the discussions. We in the Reserve Bank are also keen on this subjectand look forward to benefit from the deliberations of this Conference.My remarks on this occasion will be structured along the following lines. I will providesome introduction on the importance of this topic in modern day societies, followed by anoverview of the global practice in this area. Any discussion on financial education inIndia would need to acknowledge the Indian realities as well. The concluding thoughtsare in the nature of possible approaches towards expanding the outreach of financialeducation in India.BackgroundFinancial education can broadly be defined as the capacity to have familiarity with andunderstanding of financial market products, especially rewards and risks in order tomake informed choices. Viewed from this standpoint, financial education primarilyrelates to personal financial education to enable individuals to take effective actions toimprove overall well-being and avoid distress in matters that are financial.The focus of any discussion on financial education is primarily on the individual, whousually has limited resources and skills to appreciate the complexities of financialdealings with financial intermediaries on matters relating to personal finance on a day-to-day basis. The process of economic reforms, which includes deregulation and                                                          1Inaugural Address by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the InternationalConference on Financial Education organised by OECD and co-hosted by Pension FundRegulatory and Development Authority at New Delhi on September 21, 2006.marketisation, should have educating and empowering the common person toparticipate in the financial marketplace with knowledge and confidence, as a criticalcomponent of public policy.The need for financial education is felt in the developed and the developing countriesalike. In the developed countries, the increasing number and complexity of financialproducts, the continuing shift in responsibility for providing social security fromgovernments and financial institutions to individuals, and the growing importance ofindividual retirement planning make it imperative that financial education be provided toall.In the developing countries also, the increasing participation of a growing number ofconsumers in newly developing financial markets will necessitate the provision offinancial education – if these markets are to expand and operate efficiently. In addition,the substantial growth of international transactions during the last decade, resulting fromnew technologies and the growing international mobility of individuals, makes theimprovement in financial education, increasingly, an international concern.From a regulatory perspective, financial education empowers the common person andthus reduces the burden of protecting the common person from the elements of marketfailure, attributable to, de facto, information asymmetries. For example, the emphasis onmarket discipline, as one of the three pillars of banking regulation, especially underBasel II, is best served by participation of financially literate bank customers in thefinancial marketplace.Financial education can make a difference not only in the quality of life that individualscan afford, but also the integrity and quality of markets. It can provide individuals withbasic tools for budgeting, help them to acquire the discipline to save and thus, ensurethat they can enjoy a dignified life after retirement. Financially educated consumers, inturn, can benefit the economy by encouraging genuine competition, forcing the serviceproviders to innovate and improve their levels of efficiency.Global practicesIt has been said, particularly in the context of the developed economies that while theyoung do not save enough and do not fully understand the need for investments forfuture, many of the elderly tend to feel the pinch of poverty. In this background, priorityneed to be accorded to financial education.For example, in the UK, the Financial Services Authority has launched the biggest evercampaign to improve the financial skills of the population and imparting education toenable a better appreciation of the risks and rewards inherent in financial instruments.The US Treasury established its Office of Financial Education in 2002. The Office worksto promote access to the financial education tools that can help all US citizens makewiser choices in all areas of personal financial management, with a special emphasis onsaving, credit management, home ownership and retirement planning. The FinancialLiteracy and Education Commission (FLEC), established by the Congress in 2003through the passage of the Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act, wascreated with the purpose of improving the financial literacy and education of persons inthe United States through development of a national strategy to promote financialliteracy and education. The Federal Reserve, along with numerous other federalgovernment agencies, is a member of this commission, which is supported by the Officeof Financial Education.The Federal Reserve System’s recently redesigned financial education website,FederalReserveEducation.org, is dovetailed to increase the use of Federal Reserveeducational materials and promote financial education in the classroom. The websitehas material intended for the general public, as well as materials specifically gearedtoward teachers and high school and college students. It provides easy access to freeeducational materials, a resource search engine for teachers, and games for variousages and knowledge levels. The other regional Feds also have various interactive on-line programmes on their website designed to generate awareness about better financialmanagement and assessment of one's own financial position.In Australia, the Government established a National Consumer and Financial LiteracyTaskforce in 2002, which recommended the institution of the Financial LiteracyFoundation in 2005. Working closely with states and territories, the Foundation hasproduced a National Curriculum Framework for Financial Literacy to provide benchmarksfor teaching the school children the importance of managing their money.In Malaysia, the Financial Sector Master Plan, launched in 2001, includes a 10-yearconsumer education program. This agenda includes infrastructure and institutionalcapacity development in the areas of financial education, advisory services, distressmanagement and rehabilitation. For this purpose, the Bank Negara Malaysia inpartnership with the financial industry and other government agencies, has introducedthe Financial Mediation Bureau, Deposit Insurance Scheme, Basic Banking ServicesFramework as well as created a new class of licensed Financial Advisers. Savings andeducation programs are also being promoted in schools. A one-stop centre has recentlybeen established within the central bank for the public to obtain information aboutfinancial services in Malaysia and to provide face-to-face customer service on generalenquiries and complaints. These initiatives have been reinforced by high levels oftransparency and disclosure.In collaboration with the government agencies, Monetary Authority of Singaporelaunched a national financial education programme (MoneySENSE) to enhance financialliteracy and self-reliance of consumers. The programme covers three tiers of financialliteracy: basic money management covers skills in budgeting and saving as also tips onresponsible use of credit (tier I); equipping citizens with the skills and knowledge to planfor their long-term financial needs (tier II); and imparting knowledge about differentinvestment products and skills for investing (tier III).Above all, the OECD has been taking a pro-active initiative in generating awarenessabout financial education. It has recently released a major international study onfinancial education titled 'Improving Financial Literacy' encompassing practicalguidelines on good practices in financial education and awareness. These guidelines, inthe form of a non-binding recommendation, are designed to help countries devise andimplement effective financial education programmes, drawing from the best practices inthis area in OECD countries. They promote the role of all the main stakeholders infinancial education: governments, financial institutions, employers, trade unions andconsumer groups. In addition, they also draw a clear distinction between publicinformation provided by the government and regulatory authorities, and that supplied bythe financial analysts.It is also important to devise ways to ascertain whether financial education has achievedits objective, such as generating increased consumer awareness or a changedbehaviour, a point I will return to a little later. The balance of evidence, however,suggests that such programmes tend to be effective. For instance, in the United States,it has been observed that workers increase their participation in retirement savings plansfunded by employee and employer contributions when the latter offers financialeducation programmes, whether in the form of brochures or seminars. Consumers whoattend one-on-one counselling sessions on their personal finances have fewerdelinquencies.Indian realitiesPrior to the initiation of financial sector reforms in the early 1990s, the Indian financialsystem essentially catered to the needs of planned development. Customers had littlechoice in financial instruments. The segmented and underdeveloped financial marketsmeant that their exposure to risk was also limited. In such a situation, customers couldemploy their basic skills to invest in simple financial products with assured returns,unconcerned about their risks. The relevance of financial education was, at best, limited.Pursuant to the process of globalisation, the economic and financial landscape in India isundergoing a significant transformation. In the process, the economy has become morediversified with new sources of growth. In tandem with these changes, we have seen themodernisation of the financial sector that has also become increasingly more diversifiedto meet the new requirements of the economy. The financial sector has also increasinglyleveraged on advances in technology which has significantly changed the way financialbusiness is being conducted. As market advances continue to expand the range offinancial products and services, consumers are being faced with increasinglymultifaceted choices and options in the management of their personal finances andexposure to a gamut of risks. In this complex financial landscape, it becomes importantfor consumers to have improved access to information.Significant changes have also occurred in the social sphere. While on the one hand,costs of education have increased substantially, the longevity levels have also risen, onthe other. Taken together, this implies that the elderly are now required to achieve aconstant rebalancing of their consumption and investment portfolios. The increased lifeexpectancy has also compelled employers to move away from ad hoc fundedsuperannuation schemes to defined contribution schemes. At the same time, theadvances in information technology have lowered the costs of information acquisitionand processing as also of searching a job. This, in turn, has significantly raised jobmobility with attendant implications for family size and expenditure patterns.Financial education assumes importance in this changed financial environment. Inconsidering means to improve the financial status of families, financial education canplay a critical role by equipping consumers with the knowledge required to choose froma myriad of financial products and providers. In addition, financial education can helpprovide individuals with the knowledge necessary to create household budgets, initiatesavings plans, manage debt, and make strategic investment decisions for theirretirement or for their children's education. Being educated financially also enablesindividuals to better appreciate the possible contingencies and save for a rainy day, in anappropriate manner. It can empower consumers to become better shoppers, allowingthem to procure goods and services at lower cost. This process, in turn, raisesconsumers' real purchasing power and multiplies the opportunities for them to consume,save, or invest. Having these basic financial planning skills can help families to meettheir near-term obligations and maximise their longer-term financial well-being.Financial education is also an integral component of customer protection. Despiteconcerted efforts, the current state of transparency coupled with the difficulty ofconsumers in identifying and understanding the fine print from the large volume ofconvoluted information, leads to an information asymmetry between the financialintermediary and the customer. For example, customers are often penalised for minorviolations in repayments, although they have limited redressal mechanisms to rectifydeficiencies in service by banks, rendering the banker-customer relationship one ofunequals. In this relationship, it is the principal, that is, the depositor, who is actually farless powerful than the agent, that is,  the bank. The representations received in regard tolevying of unreasonably high service or user charges and enhancement of user chargeswithout proper and prior intimation, and the growing number of customer complaintsagainst the banks, also testify to this fact. In this context, financial education may help toprevent vulnerable consumers from falling prey to financially disquieting creditarrangements.There are however, issues that would need to be addressed upfront in the Indiancontext. First, the regional profile in our country is diversified, with people acrossdifferent regions being typically conversant in their vernacular languages. Second, thereexists a wide divergence in literacy levels across States. Thus, for instance, in severalStates and union territories, the literacy rates in 2001 were well above the nationalaverage of 65.4 per cent; in contrast, there were also regions where literacy levels haveremained perennially low. Third, the dependency ratio varies markedly across states.Fourth, within a State, there are marked  differences between rural and urban areas.Fifth, there is also a perceptible variation in the penetration of banking across regions.Taken together, these unique conditions in our country create a role for the public policyto devise enabling mechanisms  to improve the levels of financial education, reckoningthe regional differences. To the extent the common person is better able to understandand appreciate the need for financial education, the task of the financial regulators isgreatly simplified, lowering the overall costs of regulation.Possible approachesIt is an imperative of increasing globalisation that the difference in the pace of growth ofthe financial sector and financial education be minimized. There are several ways to goabout this process. For purposes of illustration, these can be classified as institutionalmechanisms, delivery mechanisms and decentralisation of efforts.Institutional mechanismsAs regards the institutional mechanism, there is near consensus on the fact that anyattempt at expanding the outreach of financial education needs to start at the grass-roots. Present day school pass-outs need to be a lot more financially literate than theirparents were, if they are to manage their personal finances successfully through life. Inaddition, universities and business schools have an important role in training financialspecialists able to provide the public with high quality advice on financial matters.Yet another channel for imparting financial education could be the workplace where itcan reach most of the working adults. It would, therefore, be a potent mechanism forproviding information about a number of financial services  such as retirement schemesand insurance.The role of financial institutions in providing financial education, not only to the clientsbut also to their own staff, needs to be better defined and further promoted. Moreinformation is needed at both international and national levels on good programmes andpractices and on the ways to promote access to financial services by harnessing the roleof non-government organisations (NGOs).International organisations are well-positioned to coordinate international surveys andstudies on the various aspects of financial education, to evaluate the comparativeefficiency of various financial education programmes, and to develop guidelines andgood practices for policymakers for implementation. International agencies can alsoprovide a forum where countries can compare and discuss strategies to educateconsumers about financial issues.Several governments and central banks, either directly or indirectly, are actively involvedin the provision of financial education about consumer credit, investment, and otherfinancial issues, often as part of a public policy campaign to improve the protection ofindividual borrowers and investors, for instance, as part of the ongoing pension reformefforts. Exchange of experiences amongst central banks would  thus be productive.Delivery mechanismsThe delivery mechanisms for imparting financial education can be manifold. However,the content and delivery of financial education should correspond to the needs ofspecific sub-groups of consumers that is, the young or elderly, less or better educated,well- or ill-informed. Presentations, lectures, conferences, symposia, training coursesand seminars can be actively utilised for this purpose.Second, publications in diverse forms, including books, brochures, magazines,booklets/pamphlets, direct mail documents, can also be useful in this regard.Third, leveraging information technology through concerted media campaigns using allpossible avenues of mass communication can be expected to impart greater efficacy tothe process. Other methods include advisory services from institutions, including the fastgrowing telecommunication services.Not only the supply of financial education, but also the demand is very important. Mostdelivery channels are good for those who are already interested in particular topics. Animportant challenge is to create demand for financial information and education.Decentralisation of effortsGiven the unique conditions in our country, any attempt at expanding the outreach offinancial education should take cognisance of the role of regional differences inlanguage, workforce and penetration of finance. Thus, banks with strong presenceacross different regions could explore the possibility of introducing a local-languagebased web-site providing details of facilities for customers.Second, in recent times, the explosion of the internet has altered the relationshipbetween financial organisations and its clientele. Organisations can examine ways tobetter communicate with both the prospective and existing clients by enriching theinformation content of their website on the lines of those practiced in the maturemarkets.Third, credit counselling can be a potent tool for financial entities to expand the reach offinancial education.Fourth, it might be of interest for reputed organisations like the National Council ofApplied Economic Research (NCAER) to conduct surveys at periodic intervals toascertain the degree of consumer awareness about financial products and services. Thefindings emanating from such studies could be shared with financial entities to enablethem to address the gaps in their service delivery and promote informed decision-making.Fourth, several bodies, such as the Financial Planning Standards Board of India(FPSBI), a professional standards setting body constituted with public-private enterprise,are reportedly making proactive efforts to uniformly regulate personal financial planningpractitioners. Much more of such efforts will be required to guide the development andpromotion of standards for financial planning professionals to benefit and protect thepublic in the country.Role of the RBIThe RBI, on its part, wishes to advance the cause of financial education in our countryas part of an overall strategy. The  strategy pursued in this regard can be elucidated asfollows. Concerted efforts are underway to expand the reach of formal finance in view ofrecent emphasis on financial inclusion. This needs to be buttressed with financialeducation to generate greater customer awareness and understanding of financialproducts and services. Concurrently, a process of credit counselling is being encouragedto help all borrowers, but particularly those in distress to overcome current financialproblems and gain access to the structured financial system. The Banking Codes andStandards Board of India (BCSBI) has also been instituted which is expected to ensurethat the banks formulate and adhere to their own comprehensive code of conduct forminimum standards of banking services, which individual customers can legitimatelyexpect. And finally, a Banking Ombudsman Scheme has been instituted for redressal ofgrievances against deficient banking services, covering all the States and UnionTerritories.The RBI has also been exploring the possibility of instituting a Depositor Protection Fund(DPF). The Fund can be utilised towards generating greater awareness for the commonman on issues relating to financial education and counselling. This could becomplemented with providing greater role to our Regional Offices to promote financialeducation in their respective jurisdictions.ConclusionThe international co-operation of the kind which OECD and PFRDA have embarkedupon is a welcome development. I would like to congratulate them for undertaking thisuseful initiative and thank them for giving me an opportunity to be a part of this process.I have no doubt that this Conference will prove to be an important milestone in the areaof financial education for our country.We, at the RBI, too look forward to benefiting from the deliberations.Thank you.
