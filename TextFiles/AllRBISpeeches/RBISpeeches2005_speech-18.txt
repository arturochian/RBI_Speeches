Regulation and Risk Management: Implementing Basel IIIt is indeed an honour to be amongst you on the occasion of the PlatinumJubilee Celebrations of The South Indian Bank Ltd. Today we remember thefounders and pay homage to their vision and drive that led to the establishmentof this bank. It is not only a day to feel proud, it is a day to reflect, a day to share,and a day to celebrate. It is also an opportunity to re-emphasise what theinstitution stands for, which not only helps in projecting its corporate culture andidentity, but also constitutes an integral part of the institutions’ brand buildingexercise.In it’s more than 75 years of existence, the bank has traversed a longjourney from a unit bank set up in Thrissur, with a capital of Rs. 22,000contributed by 44 shareholders to a bank with capital funds of Rs. 474 crorecontributed by 90,000 shareholders, and a branch network spread over 17States/Union Territories. The South Indian Bank Ltd. has thus become a majorold generation private sector bank with a regional origin and national presence.I am told that as on 31 March 2005, the South Indian Bank Ltd. hadrecorded a total gross business turnover of Rs. 14,000 Crores with deposits ofRs.8523 Crores and advances of Rs.5727 Crores. Gross NPA ratio of the bankstood at 6.61% and net NPA ratio at 3.87. The bank will have to work onreducing the level of existing NPAs, and put in place proper risk managementsystems to ensure a low level of incremental NPAs in future. This is essential forensuring that the bank is in a position to compete successfully with the otherbanks in the post Basel II era. This brings me to the topic of my address -Regulation and Risk Management: Implementation of Basel II.Regulation and Risk ManagementFriends, it is clear that we are at the beginning of a new phase in theIndian banking. The last decade has witnessed major changes in the financialsector: New banks, new financial institutions, new instruments, new windows,and new opportunities and, along with all this, new challenges. The mostprominent on our minds in the context of banking these days, perhaps, are theimplications arising out of the Basel II accord. Banks, as we all know, aresubjected to more intense regulation as compared to the non-financial firms. Thisis probably because the banks possess certain “special” characteristics:  Banksare much more leveraged than the other firms due to their capacity to garnerpublic deposits. The asset - liability structure of the banks is also different fromnot only the non-financial firms but also the financial firms. To illustrate, the risk inan insurance company arises mainly from the liability side of the balance sheet inthe form of insurance claims whereas for the bank the risk mainly comes from thediminution of asset values (for example, illiquid loans that are not fullyrecoverable). The deposits which constitute a major part of the liability of banksare repayable on demand, unsecured and their principal amount does notchange in value whereas the loans of a bank are illiquid and there can be erosionin the value of loans or of other assets. The liquidity transformation by aninsurance company is in the reverse direction as compared to a bank. Thebalance-sheet structure of an insurance company is the least likely to give rise tosystemic risk, whereas banks due to their typical asset liability mismatches  i.e.long term assets funded by short term liabilities, may be prone to ‘run’ and posea very high degree of potential systemic risk. The resolution costs of systemicbank insolvencies and significant banking problems can be substantial. Thefinancial services regulators and Central Banks are increasingly focusing theirattention not only on the health of the individual banks and financial institutionsbut also on issues of financial stability.Bank regulation is now increasingly getting risk-centric. This process hadits origin in the Cooke Committee or the Basel I proposals which for the first timeprescribed a risk-based capital adequacy framework for banks by recognizingthat different counterparties had different risks and therefore had to be risk-weighted differently. Accordingly, the risk-weights of 0%, 20% and 100% wereassigned for the exposures to Government, Banks and Corporates, respectively.Further, for the first time the framework required capital to be maintained for theoff-balance sheet exposures also. Moreover, capital was seen as multi-tieredwith Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital and some jurisdictions permit the use of Tier 3capital as well. These proposals were path-breaking considering the credit riskmanagement capabilities of the banks in 1980s. As we all know, more than 100countries implemented Basel I which indicates the widespread impact it had onthe bank regulation and risk management.Basel I proposals forced the banks to look at credit risk and regulatorycapital more closely than they had done earlier. As banks found ways toarbitrage regulatory capital, some of the provisions of Basel I became lessrelevant. Simultaneously, banks in the G-10 countries developed newerapproaches to manage credit risk by building portfolio models for pricing,provisioning and allocating economic capital for the credit portfolios. Thesedevelopments made the weaknesses in the Basel I framework more apparentand this set the stage for the creation of “International Convergence of CapitalMeasurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework”, popularly knownas Basel II.Concurrently, there has been a realization that the traditional supervisorypractices were out of step with the sophisticated risk management techniquesbeing employed by the complex financial institutions and a risk-based approachto supervision was required to capture the various risks that the firms wereundertaking and the controls built for addressing these risks. Although there arekey differences in design and methodology of risk-based supervision frameworkin countries like America, Canada, UK and Australia, yet the underlying principlesremain the same: the supervisory processes and tools are reoriented inaccordance with the risks in the supervised firms; specific tools of supervision aretargeted to the areas of greatest risk and concern in individual firms and thisresults in a cost effective allocation of the finite supervisory resources across theregulated entities.Basel IIiThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has observed that thefundamental objective in revising the 1988 Accord has been, and I quote, “todevelop a framework that would further strengthen the soundness and stability ofthe international banking system while maintaining sufficient consistency thatcapital adequacy regulation will not be a significant source of competitiveinequality among internationally active banks. The (Basel) Committee believesthat the revised Framework will promote the adoption of stronger riskmanagement practices by the banking industry, and views this as one of its majoriibenefits” Unquote. Basel II has brought regulation and risk management to thecentre stage: the regulatory capital is more closely aligned to the risks in banksand there is a trend towards convergence of the regulatory and economic capital,especially in the advanced approaches.Basel II rests on the three pillars, Pillar I - minimum capital requirements,Pillar 2 - supervisory review process and market discipline as Pillar 3.Pillar 1 – Minimum Capital RequirementsFor the first time, capital charge for operational risk has been mandatedunder pillar 1. Moreover Pillar 1 provides for a menu of approaches for computingcapital adequacy and banks have the freedom to choose the approach theywould like to adopt. Basel II requires that all the three pillars need to beimplemented and, therefore, each pillar is as important as the other one.As you would be aware, India has decided that all the commercial banks wouldhave to be Basel II compliant by adopting at a minimum, the StandardizedApproach for credit risk and Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk underPillar 1, with effect from March 31, 2007.  The adoption of IRB Approach may bepermitted by RBI in due course after adequate skills are developed, both inbanks and at supervisory levels.Implementation of the simplified approaches also requires preparation onthe part of the banks, banking regulators and the rating agencies. Banks have togather data relating to the rated exposures in order to risk-weight themaccordingly and track the ratings migrations of these exposures. The ratingagencies have to demonstrate that they adhere, on an ongoing basis, to the sixparameters laid down under Basel II for their recognition, viz., Objectivity,Independence, International Access/Transparency, Disclosure, Resources andCredibility. The rating agencies have also to develop frameworks for assigningIssuer Rating instead of the Issue Rating that they have carried out so far.Pillar 2- Supervisory ReviewPillar 2 is meant not only for ensuring adequate capital to support all therisks in a bank, but also to encourage banks to adopt better risk management. Itis the prime responsibility of the bank management to ensure that the bank hasadequate capital commensurate with its risk profile and control environment. Therole of Supervisors is to evaluate whether or not the banks are assessing theircapital requirements under pillar 2 properly in relation to their risks & if necessarythe supervisors may intervene to mandate a higher capital requirement.However, it is important to note that increased capital is not the only option foraddressing increased risks in a bank. Although capital serves the purpose ofmeeting the unexpected losses, capital is not a substitute for inadequate controlor risk management systems. Banks should strive to create sound internalcontrol or risk management processes.From the point of view of analyzing risks and assigning capital againstthose risks, Pillar 2 is much more inclusive in the sense that it not only capturesthe risks covered under Pillar 1 ( credit risk, market risk and operational risk) butalso the credit concentration risk which is not fully captured by Pillar 1.  Inaddition, Pillar 2 must address the risks not captured by Pillar 1, such as, Interestrate risk in banking book, Liquidity risk, Business risk, Strategic risk andReputation risk. The Business cycle effects which represent factors external tothe bank are also to be covered under Pillar 2.India has implemented the risk based supervision (RBS) framework whichevaluates the risk profile of the banks through an analysis of 12 risk factors viz,eight business risks and four control risks. The eight business risks relate to:Capital, Credit Risk, Market Risk, Earnings, Liquidity Risk, Business Strategy andEnvironment Risk, Operational Risk and Group Risk. The control risks relate toInternal Controls Risk, Organisation risk, Management Risk and ComplianceRisk. The RBS framework is currently undergoing further refinement. The RBSmethodology can be used as a starting point for the implementation of pillar 2proposals in India.Pillar 3- Market DisciplineRegulation is not and cannot be an alternative to market discipline.Actually, market discipline supplements regulation in the sense that monitoring ofthe banks and financial institutions is not only carried out by the regulators butalso by the markets, which includes other banks & financial institutions,customers, depositors, subordinated debt instrument holders, rating agenciesetc. The discipline imposed by the markets can be as powerful as the sanctionsimposed by the regulator.Reserve Bank of India has been advising banks to make disclosures inorder to enhance market discipline. Although banks in India make severaldisclosures in their Notes on Accounts to the Balance Sheet, for implementingPillar 3 more work requires to be done. The banks are required to have a formaldisclosure policy approved by their Board of directors highlighting whatdisclosures the bank will make and the internal controls over the disclosureprocess. The banks have also to implement a process for assessing theappropriateness of their disclosures, including validation and frequency. TheReserve Bank of India may consider imposing a penalty, including financialpenalty, in case of non-compliance with the prescribed disclosure requirements.ConclusionSo far, we have covered the various issues in the implementation of thesimplified approaches of Basel II. The implementation of Advanced Approaches,such as IRB Approach for credit risk and Advanced Measurement Approach forOperational Risk, require much more preparation and pose several challengesfor both the banks as well as the supervisors.  The banks would require to meetthe minimum requirements relating to internal ratings at the outset and on anongoing basis, such as those relating to the design of the rating system,operations, controls, corporate governance and estimation and validation ofcredit risk components: Probability of Default (PD) for both Foundation andAdvanced IRB, and Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure At Default (EAD) forAdvanced IRB.  The banks should have at a minimum PD data for five years andLGD and EAD data for seven years. The manpower skills, the IT infrastructureand MIS at the banks would have to be upgraded substantially. The supervisorswould require developing skills in validation and back testing of models.With the focus on regulation and risk management in the Basel IIframework gaining prominence, the post Basel II era will belong to the banks whomanage their risks effectively. The banks with proper risk management systemswould not only gain competitive advantage by way of lower regulatory capitalcharge but also add value to the shareholders and other stakeholders by properlypricing their services, adequate provisioning and maintaining a robust financialhealth.As we stand at this juncture, I trust innovative and illuminating ideas, freshinsights and alternative ways of thinking about the competitive yet cooperativecombat that the world of banking and finance is readying itself for will mark theSouth Indian Bank’s business strategies and institutional development plans andwill give you the emotive content to carry forward the legacy and vision of yourfounding fathers and take your institution to new heights. With these words I wishyou every success in all your future endeavours.Thank youAddress of Shri V Leeladhar, Deputy Governor, delivered at the Platinum JubileeCelebrations of the South Indian Bank Ltd., Thirussur on July 9, 2005                                                i The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is a committee of banking supervisory authorities that wasestablished by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten countries in 1975. It consists of seniorrepresentatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and theUnited States. It usually meets at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, where its permanentSecretariat is located.ii Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “International Convergence of Capital Measurementand Capital Standards- A Revised Framework”, June 2004.
