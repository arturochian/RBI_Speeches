1Seminar oBanking Reforms and Strategies The first phase of banking sector reforms initiated in pursuance of the recommendations ofthe Committee on Financial Sector Reforms provided the necessary platform to the bankingsector to operate on the basis of operational flexibility and functional autonomy, therebyenhancing efficiency, productivity and profitability. Keeping in view the major changes thattook place in the macro economic environment and policy and institutional developments inthe interim period, the Government of India set up in 1997 a Committee on Banking SectorReforms under the Chairmanship of Shri M. Narasimham to review the record ofimplementation of financial system reforms recommended by the earlier Committee and tolook ahead and chart the reforms necessary in future to make India’s banking system strongerand better equipped to meet the global competition.The recommendations of the Committee were directed at further improvements in prudentialand other reforms to strengthen the banking sector and to move towards international bestpractices in a number of areas which formed the very basis of the second phase of bankingsector reforms. These covered aspects of banking policy, institutional, supervisory andlegislative aspects.  The Government of India and the RBI have taken various measure policyinitiatives in this regard.The statutory preemptions in the form of SLR and CRR have been brought down in a phasedmanner to 25% and 5.5% respectively.  The interest rates have been deregulated in a phasedmanner. Except lending to small borrowers and a part of export finance, all lending rateshave been deregulated. Interest rates on deposits are now almost free except for prescriptionin respect of savings deposits. The interest rate on Government borrowings is also nowmarket determined.  In order to strengthen the financial position of banks, CRAR was furtherincreased from 8% to 9% from the year ending March 31, 2000. With a view to adopting theinternational best practices in regard to income recognition, asset classification andprovisioning, number of policy changes have been made, viz., prescription of provisioningrequirement of 0.25% in respect of standard (or performing) assets, reduction of the timeperiod for classification of doubtful asset from 18 months to 12 months from March 31,2005, introduction of 90 days norms  for  classification of NPAs w.e.f. March 31, 2004. Theceiling on exposure to a single borrower has been reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent ofthe bank’s capital funds that had been redefined w.e.f March 31, 2002, etc. Banks were alsoadvised to classify investment portfolio into three categories viz., Held to Maturity, Availablefor Sale and Held for Trading, effective from September 30, 2000, in line with internationalbest practices,The transparency and disclosure standards recommended in the International AccountingStandards have been implemented in a phased manner.  Disclosures requirements have beenfurther broad-based and banks have been advised to disclose maturity pattern of deposits,borrowings, investments and advances and foreign currency assets and liabilities, movementsin NPAs and lending to sensitive sectors with effect from March 31, 2000. From year endedMarch 31, 2001, banks were advised to disclose total advances against shares and totalinvestments made in equity shares, convertible debentures and equity – oriented mutualfunds. Further, from year ended March 31, 2002 the banks are required to disclose movementof Provisions held towards NPAs and movement of Provisions held towards depreciation ofinvestments, the total amount of standard/ sub-standard assets subjected to CDR, etc.                                                       1Inaugural address by Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at Hyderabad on August30, 2002 at National Seminar on “Banking Reforms and Strategies” organized by The Federation of AndhraPradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.2With a view to injecting greater competition in the banking industry, 10 new private sectorbanks have been set up since 1993 and RBI has since granted in-principle approval of settingup of two new private sector banks. The banks have been given greater autonomy in the areaslike branch licensing, credit delivery, recruitment and creation of posts, etc, subject tofulfillment of certain criteria.The rigidities in the legal system have come in the way for early resolution of the stock ofNPAs in the banking system. Recognising the need for expeditious recovery of banks’ dues,Government and RBI have initiated a number of steps for expediting the recovery of NPAs.The important legal reforms measures include amendment of Recovery of Debts due toBanks and Financial Institutions Act in March 2000 vesting DRTs with new powers whichfocus on improving the infrastructure facilities of DRTs by way of posting of additionalRecovery Officers, setting up of an expert group under the chairmanship of Shri T.R.Andhyarujina to suggest appropriate amendments in the legal framework affecting thebanking sector issuance of an Ordinance in June, 2002 for regulation of securitisation andreconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest and allied mattersthereto, etc.With the gradual liberalisation of the Indian Financial System and growing integration of thedomestic market with the external markets, the risk associated with the banks’ operationshave been complex and large, requiring strategic management. RBI has issued guidelines onALM systems and on integrated risk management systems in banks.  Due to diversity andvarying size of balance sheets, banks have been advised to design risk managementarchitecture, dictated by the size, complexity of business, risk philosophy, market perceptionand the level of capital. To fine tune the risk management systems in banks, RBI has sinceissued draft guidance notes on credit and market risk.The development financial institutions have evolved in India with specific focus on long termfinancing which the commercial banks were not able to meet.  The distinctions between shortterm and long term financing are increasingly getting blurred over time.  The complexitiesinvolved in harmonising the role and operation of development financial institutions havebeen examined and RBI has already allowed the merger of ICICI and ICICI Bank as a majorstep towards universal banking.As a major step towards corporate governance in banks, banks were advised to place beforetheir Board of Directors the Report of the Consultative Group of Directors of banks and FIs(Dr. Ganguly Group) set up to review the supervisory role of Boards banks. Therecommendations included the responsibility of the Board of Directors, role andresponsibility of independent and non-executive directors, fit and proper norms fornomination of directors in private sector banks, etc. The banks were advised that based on thedecision taken by the Board, these recommendations can be adopted and implemented.Certain recommendations of the Group require the approval of the Government or legislativeamendments and hence they have been referred to Government for consideration.Co-operative banks as corporate entities possess unique characteristics. Paradoxical as it maysound, evolution of Co-operatives in India as people’s organisations rather than businessenterprises adopting professional managerial systems has hindered growth of professionalismin Co-operatives and proved to be a neglected areas in their evolution. The co-operativebanks should indeed work like professional organisations on sound managerial systems intune with the needs of the time taking care of future projections of requirements to retain andimprove their market share and identity in the long run. It is in this context that3professionalism and accountability of the banks’ boards assume such critical significance andintroduction of corporate governance in Urban Co-operative Bank’s would long way topromote this professionalism.One area which is essential for best corporate governance practices is transparency and inparticular the transparency in the balance sheet. The Auditors have big role to play inbringing transparency in the balance sheet of the co-operative banks. They are expected to bewell-versed with all aspects of the new guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India andthey should ensure that the profit & loss account and balance sheet of co-operative banks areprepared in a transparent manner and reflect the true state of affairs. Auditors should alsoensure that other necessary statutory provisions and appropriations out of profits are made asrequired in terms of Co-operative Societies Act/Rules of the state concerned and the bye-laws of the respective institutions.Although regulators are external pressure points for good corporate governance, even themost comprehensive regulatory and effective supervisory system need not be a foolproofmechanism against a plaint management acting in collusion with unscrupulous clients.Supervision is only periodic and therefore it cannot be a substitute for effective andcontinuous internal control backed by an independent and efficacious audit system. It istherefore, imperative to have in place Audit Committees of the Board independent of themanagement in co-operative banksCo-operative bank network is vast and disparate with different states having their own rulesby way of state co-operative Acts and state registrar of co-operative societies. As of now, co-operative banks are under the dual control of RBI and state registrar of co-operative societies.Recent experiences have shown that disturbance in financial system has a contagion affect.With the objective that no disturbances are caused in the financial sector the requirement fora separate regulator is keenly felt as it will monitor enforcement of banking regulations in theco-operative sector from district to state levels and co-ordinate activities of apex state co-operative banks.As a major step towards foreign direct investment in the banking sector, Reserve bank ofIndia issued guidelines/ clarifications in February, 2002. Foreign Direct Investment upto 49%from all sources is permitted in private sector banks under the automatic route, subject toconformity with the guidelines issued from time to time.Technology is at the root of all reforms in the service sector the world over with the financialsector having been one of the major beneficiaries of utilizing technological advancements.The Banking sector in India too has gained from large scale implementation of technology.While technology has resulted in facilities such as ‘Total Branch Automation’, ‘SingleWindow Service’ and other accounts related functions in the recent past, the thrust areas ofthe present relate to the use of technology for providing centralised systems for banks wherecentralised data exists with decentralised access to branches and their constituents. Thiswould result in the customer being treated as a customer of a bank as a whole rather than of aparticular branch.The area of Payment and settlement systems – which is at the core of banking activities hasalso got a shot in the arm thanks to emerging new technologies. The Reserve Bank has takenupon itself the implementation of reforms in payment and settlement systems – right frompaper based cheque clearing systems down to novel methods of non-paper modes of fundstransfer. Thus, we have MICR based cheque processing, Electronic Clearing Service andElectronic Funds Transfer as products which have stabilized well, apart from the INFINET4(Indian Financial Network) which is a Closed User Group safe and secure network for theuse of banks within the country. Other projects in the offing relate to the implementation ofthe Real Time Gross Settlement and the Structured Financial Messaging Solution (SFMS)which would result in standardised message based inter-bank funds based informationexchange. All these would be to the ultimate advantage of the customers, in reducing costs,apart from better housekeeping, improved customer service and overall systemic efficiency.STRATEGIES FOR FUTURE REFORMSThe Basel Committee intends to replace the current Capital Accord with a New Frameworkwhich is built on a three-pillar approach - minimum capital requirement, supervisory reviewand market. It would be necessary for our banks to move in the direction of the proposalscontained in the new Framework as and when they are introduced.  Towards this objective,banks have to refine their existing MIS and the risk management architecture.  There is also aneed for improving further the accounting and disclosure standards to fall in line with theinternational best practices. Further refinements in market risk management will have to bemade by adopting sophisticated techniques like VaR, Duration and Simulation and adoptionof  internal model-based approaches and credit risk modelling techniques at least, by topbanks.Reserve Bank has accepted the Basel Committee’s Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision. However, there are gaps in the areas of consolidated supervision, country andtransfer risk monitoring, inter-agency co-operation and cross-border supervision. Necessarysteps are already on hand for implementing consolidated supervision for both domestic andinternational operations of banks and putting in place a reporting system on a consolidatedbasis.Further, a framework of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) is being evolved with varioustrigger points with the approval of the Government.  The framework is based on threeparameters viz capital adequacy, asset quality and profitability. The framework contemplatesa set of mandatory and discretionary actions for dealing with banks that cross the triggerpoints.India has been sharing the increasing international concern on the use of the financial systemfor money laundering and financing of terrorism. RBI is in the process of setting out thepolicy, procedures and controls required to be introduced by banks. These include strictadherence to “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedures for prevention of misuse of bankingsystem for money laundering and financing of terrorist activity.I have highlighted some of the important reforms measures undertaken in the past, the futurechallenges confronting the banking  sector in the next few years and the probable strategiesto counter these challenges in the foregoing paragraphs. However, to meet the unforeseenchallenges, the banking and financial sector has to be sensitized as a whole to the need forinternal strength and effective management as well as to the overall concerns for financialstability.
