1Banking Sector Reforms in India: An OverviewY. V. ReddyGovernor Ishrat Husain and distinguished bankers,At the outset, let me express my gratitude to Governor Husain for invitingme to visit Karachi and meet with you.  I consider it an honour to be here amidstthe banking fraternity. I would like to congratulate Pakistan for its impressiveeconomic performance. Governor Husain, in his address at the Seminar onManagement of Pakistan Economy in Lahore, a few weeks ago, had this to sayabout recent economic performance of Pakistan and challenges ahead, in hischaracteristically candid fashion:"Economic growth rate has reached a solid 6 per cent plus,inflation has been contained to 5 per cent which has onlyrecently started rising, exchange rate has been stabilized, fiscaldeficit has been drastically reduced, domestic interest rateshave declined dramatically, international reserves have jumpedtwelve times their 2000 level, debt ratios have fallen significantlyand investment is booming."He further added that,"Pakistan has achieved macroeconomic stability, introducedstructural reforms, improved economic governance and resumedthe path for high growth rates.  But there is no room forcomplacency."Taking account of the nature of audience here and following the exampleof Governor Husain, who spoke eloquently on the banking sector reforms inPakistan in January this year, I have chosen to present an overview of bankingsector reforms in India.It is useful to very briefly recall the nature of the Indian banking sector atthe time of initiation of financial sector reforms in India in the early 1990s. The                                                1 Address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Institute of Bankers ofPakistan, Karachi on May 18, 2005.2Indian financial system in the pre-reform period (i.e., prior to Gulf crisis of 1991),essentially catered to the needs of planned development in a mixed-economyframework where the public sector had a dominant role in economic activity. Thestrategy of planned economic development required huge developmentexpenditure, which was met through Government’s dominance of ownership ofbanks, automatic monetization of fiscal deficit and subjecting the banking sectorto large pre-emptions – both in terms of the statutory holding of Governmentsecurities (statutory liquidity ratio, or SLR) and cash reserve ratio (CRR).Besides, there was a complex structure of administered interest rates guided bythe social concerns, resulting in cross-subsidization. These not only distorted theinterest rate mechanism but also adversely affected the viability and profitabilityof banks by the end of 1980s.  There is perhaps an element of commonality ofsuch a ‘repressed’ regime in the financial sector of many emerging marketeconomies. It follows that the process of reform of financial sector in mostemerging economies also has significant commonalities while being specific tothe circumstances of each country.  A narration of the broad contours of reform inIndia would be helpful in appreciating both the commonalities and the differencesin our paths of reforms.Contours of Banking Reforms in IndiaFirst, reform measures were initiated and sequenced to create an enablingenvironment for banks to overcome the external constraints – these were relatedto administered structure of interest rates, high levels of pre-emption in the formof reserve requirements, and credit allocation to certain sectors.  Sequencing ofinterest rate deregulation has been an important component of the reformprocess which has imparted greater efficiency to resource allocation. Theprocess has been gradual and predicated upon the institution of prudentialregulation for the banking system, market behaviour, financial opening and,above all, the underlying macroeconomic conditions. The interest rates in thebanking system have been largely deregulated except for certain specificclasses; these are: savings deposit accounts, non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits,small loans up to Rs.2 lakh and export credit.  The need for continuance of these3prescriptions as well as those relating to priority sector lending have beenflagged for wider debate in the latest annual policy of the RBI. However,administered interest rates still prevail in small savings schemes of theGovernment.Second, as regards the policy environment of public ownership, it must berecognised that the lion’s share of financial intermediation was accounted for bythe public sector during the pre-reform period. As part of the reforms programme,initially, there was infusion of capital by the Government in public sector banks,which was followed by expanding the capital base with equity participation by theprivate investors.  The share of the public sector banks in the aggregate assetsof the banking sector has come down from 90 per cent in 1991 to around 75 percent in 2004. The share of wholly Government-owned public sector banks (i.e.,where no diversification of ownership has taken place) sharply declined fromabout 90 per cent to 10 per cent of aggregate assets of all scheduled commercialbanks during the same period. Diversification of ownership has led to greatermarket accountability and improved efficiency. Since the initiation of reforms,infusion of funds by the Government into the public sector banks for the purposeof recapitalisation amounted, on a cumulative basis, to less than one per cent ofIndia’s GDP, a figure much lower than that for many other countries.  Even afteraccounting for the reduction in the Government's shareholding on account oflosses set off, the current market value of the share capital of the Government inpublic sector banks has increased manifold and as such what was perceived tobe a bail-out of public sector banks by Government seems to be turning out to bea profitable investment for the Government.Third, one of the major objectives of banking sector reforms has been toenhance efficiency and productivity through competition.  Guidelines have beenlaid down for establishment of new banks in the private sector and the foreignbanks have been allowed more liberal entry. Since 1993, twelve new privatesector banks have been set up.  As already mentioned, an element of privateshareholding in public sector banks has been injected by enabling a reduction inthe Government shareholding in public sector banks to 51 per cent. As a majorstep towards enhancing competition in the banking sector, foreign direct4investment in the private sector banks is now allowed up to 74 per cent, subjectto conformity with the guidelines issued from time to time.Fourth, consolidation in the banking sector has been another feature ofthe reform process. This also encompassed the Development FinancialInstitutions (DFIs), which have been providers of long-term finance while thedistinction between short-term and long-term finance provider has increasinglybecome blurred over time. The complexities involved in harmonising the role andoperations of the DFIs were examined and the RBI enabled the reverse-mergerof a large DFI with its commercial banking subsidiary which is a major initiativetowards universal banking. Recently, another large term-lending institution hasbeen converted into a bank. While guidelines for mergers between non-bankingfinancial companies and banks were issued some time ago, guidelines formergers between private sector banks have been issued a few days ago.  Theprinciples underlying these guidelines would be applicable, as appropriate, to thepublic sector banks also, subject to the provisions of the relevant legislation.Fifth, impressive institutional and legal reforms have been undertaken inrelation to the banking sector.  In 1994, a Board for Financial Supervision (BFS)was constituted comprising select members of the RBI Board with a variety ofprofessional expertise to exercise 'undivided attention to supervision'.  The BFS,which generally meets once a month, provides direction on a continuing basis onregulatory policies including governance issues and supervisory practices.  Italso provides direction on supervisory actions in specific cases.  The BFS alsoensures an integrated approach to supervision of commercial banks,development finance institutions, non-banking finance companies, urbancooperatives banks and primary dealers. A Board for Regulation and Supervisionof Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS) has also been recently constitutedto prescribe policies relating to the regulation and supervision of all types ofpayment and settlement systems, set standards for existing and future systems,authorise the payment and settlement systems and determine criteria formembership to these systems. The Credit Information Companies (Regulation)Bill, 2004 has been passed by both the Houses of the Parliament while theGovernment Securities Bills, 2004 is under process. Certain amendments are5being considered by the Parliament to enhance Reserve Bank’s regulatory andsupervisory powers.  Major amendments relate to requirement of prior approvalof RBI for acquisition of five per cent or more of shares of a banking companywith a view to ensuring ‘fit and proper’ status of the significant shareholders,aligning the voting rights with the economic holding and empowering the RBI tosupersede the Board of a banking company.Sixth, there have been a number of measures for enhancing thetransparency and disclosures standards. Illustratively, with a view to enhancingfurther transparency, all cases of penalty imposed by the RBI on the banks asalso directions issued on specific matters, including those arising out ofinspection, are to be placed in the public domain.Seventh, while the regulatory framework and supervisory practices havealmost converged with the best practices elsewhere in the world, two points arenoteworthy. First, the minimum capital to risk assets ratio (CRAR) has been keptat nine per cent i.e., one percentage point above the international norm; andsecond, the banks are required to maintain a separate Investment FluctuationReserve (IFR) out of profits, towards interest rate risk, at five per cent of theirinvestment portfolio under the categories ‘held for trading’ and ‘available for sale’.This was prescribed at a time when interest rates were falling and banks wererealizing large gains out of their treasury activities. Simultaneously, theconservative accounting norms did not allow banks to recognize the unrealizedgains. Such unrealized gains coupled with the creation of IFR helped incushioning the valuation losses required to be booked when interest rates in thelonger tenors have moved up in the last one year or so.Eighth, of late, the regulatory framework in India, in addition to prescribingprudential guidelines and encouraging market discipline, is increasingly focusingon ensuring good governance through "fit and proper" owners, directors andsenior managers of the banks. Transfer of shareholding of five per cent andabove requires acknowledgement from the RBI and such significant shareholdersare put through a `fit and proper' test. Banks have also been asked to ensure thatthe nominated and elected directors are screened by a nomination committee tosatisfy `fit and proper' criteria. Directors are also required to sign a covenant6indicating their roles and responsibilities. The RBI has recently issued detailedguidelines on ownership and governance in private sector banks emphasizingdiversified ownership. The listed banks are also required to comply withgovernance principles laid down by the SEBI – the securities markets regulator.Processes of Banking ReformThe processes adopted for bringing about the reforms in India may be ofsome interest to this audience.  Recalling some features of financial sectorreforms in India would be in order, before narrating the processes.   First,financial sector reform was undertaken early in the reform-cycle in India.Second, the financial sector was not driven by any crisis and the reforms havenot been an outcome of multilateral aid.  Third, the design and detail of thereform were evolved by domestic expertise, though international experience isalways kept in view.   Fourth, the Government preferred that public sector banksmanage the over-hang problems of the past rather than cleanup the balancesheets with support of the Government.  Fifth, it was felt that there is enoughroom for growth and healthy competition for public and private sector banks aswell as foreign and domestic banks.  The twin governing principles are non-disruptive progress and consultative process.In order to ensure timely and effective implementation of the measures,RBI has been adopting a consultative approach before introducing policymeasures.  Suitable mechanisms have been instituted to deliberate upon variousissues so that the benefits of financial efficiency and stability percolate to thecommon person and the services of the Indian financial system can bebenchmarked against international best standards in a transparent manner.  Letme give a brief account of these mechanisms.First, on all important issues, workings group are constituted or technicalreports are prepared, generally encompassing a review of the international bestpractices, options available and way forward.  The group membership may beinternal or external to the RBI or mixed.  Draft reports are often placed in publicdomain and final reports take account of inputs, in particular from industryassociations and self-regulatory organizations. The reform-measures emanate7out of such a series of reports, the pioneering ones being: Report of theCommittee on the Financial System (Chairman: Shri M. Narasimham), in 1991;Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments (Chairman: Dr. C.Rangarajan) in 1992; and the Report of the Committee on Banking SectorReforms (Chairman: Shri M. Narasimham) in 1998.Second, Resource Management Discussions meetings are held by theRBI with select commercial banks, prior to the policy announcements.  Thesemeetings not only focus on perception and outlook of the bankers on theeconomy, liquidity conditions, credit flow, development of different markets anddirections of interest rates, but also on issues relating to developmental aspectsof banking operations.Third, we have formed a Technical Advisory Committee on Money,Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets (TAC). It has emerged asa key consultative mechanism amongst the regulators and various marketplayers including banks.  The Committee has been crystallizing the synergies ofexperts across various fields of the financial market and thereby acting as afacilitator for the RBI in steering reforms in money, government   securities andforeign exchange markets.Fourth, in order to strengthen the consultative process in the regulatorydomain and to place such a process on a continuing basis, the RBI hasconstituted a Standing Technical Advisory Committee on Financial Regulation onthe lines similar to the TAC. The Committee consists of experts drawn fromacademia, financial markets, banks, non-bank financial institutions and creditrating agencies. The Committee examines the issues referred to it and advisesthe RBI on desirable regulatory framework on an on-going basis for banks, non-bank financial institutions and other market participants.Fifth, for ensuring periodic formal interaction, amongst the regulators,there is a High Level Co-ordination Committee on Financial and Capital Markets(HLCCFCM) with the Governor, RBI as the Chairman, and the Heads of thesecurities market and insurance regulators, and the Secretary of the FinanceMinistry as the members. This Co-ordination Committee has authorised8constitution of several standing committees to ensure co-ordination in regulatoryframeworks at an operational level.Sixth, more recently a Standing Advisory Committee on Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) has been activated to advise on structural, regulatoryand supervisory issues relating to UCBs and to facilitate the process offormulating future approaches for this sector.  Similar mechanisms are beingworked out for non-banking financial companies.Seventh, the RBI has also instituted a mechanism of placing draft versionsof important guidelines for comments of the public at large before finalisation ofthe guidelines. To further this consultative process and with a specific goal ofmaking the regulatory guidelines more user-friendly, a Users’ Consultative Panelhas been constituted comprising the representatives of select banks and marketparticipants. The panel provides feedback on regulatory instructions at theformulation stage to avoid any subsequent ambiguities and operational glitches.Eighth, an extensive and transparent communication system has beenevolved.  The annual policy statements and their mid-term reviews communicatethe RBI’s stance on monetary policy in the immediate future of six months to oneyear. Over the years, the reports of various working groups and committees haveemerged as another plank of two-way communication from RBI.  An importantfeature of the RBI’s communication policy is the almost real-time dissemination ofinformation through its web-site. The auction results under Liquidity AdjustmentFacility (LAF) of the day are posted on the web-site by 12.30 p.m the same day,while by 2.30 p.m. the ‘reference rates’ of select foreign currencies are alsoplaced on the website.  By the next day morning, the press release on moneymarket operations is issued. Every Saturday, by 12 noon, the weekly statisticalsupplement is placed on the web-site providing a fairly detailed, recent data-baseon the RBI and the financial sector. All the regulatory and administrative circularsof different Departments of the RBI are placed on the web-site within half an hourof their finalization.Ninth, an important feature of the reform of the Indian financial system hasbeen the intent of the authorities to align the regulatory framework withinternational best practices keeping in view the developmental needs of the9country and domestic factors. Towards this end, a Standing Committee onInternational Financial Standards and Codes was constituted in 1999. TheStanding Committee had set up ten Advisory Groups in key areas of the financialsector whose reports are available on the RBI website. The recommendationscontained in these reports have either been implemented or are in the process ofimplementation. I would like to draw your attention to two reports in particular,which have a direct bearing on the banking system, viz., Advisory Group onBanking Supervision and Advisory Group on Corporate Governance.Subsequently, in 2004, we conducted a review of the recommendations of theAdvisory Groups and reported the progress and agenda ahead.What has been the Impact?These reform measures have had major impact on the overall efficiencyand stability of the banking system in India. The present capital adequacy ofIndian banks is comparable to those at international level. There has been amarked improvement in the asset quality with the percentage of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) to gross advances for the banking system reducedfrom 14.4 per cent in 1998 to 7.2 per cent in 2004. The reform measures havealso resulted in an improvement in the profitability of banks.  The Return onAssets (RoA) of the banks rose from 0.4 per cent in the year 1991-92 to 1.2 percent in 2003-04. Considering that, globally, the RoA has been in the range 0.9 to1.5 per cent for 2004, Indian banks are well placed. The banking sector reformsalso emphasized the need to review the manpower resources and rationalize therequirements by drawing a realistic plan so as to reduce the operating cost andimprove the profitability. During the last five years, the business per employee forpublic sector banks more than doubled to around Rs.25 million in 2004.Continuity, Change and ContextWe lay considerable emphasis on appropriate mix between the elementsof continuity and change in the process of reform, but the dynamic elements inthe mix are determined by the context.  While there is usually a consensus on thebroad direction, relative emphasis on various elements of the process of reform10keeps changing, depending on the evolving circumstances.  Perhaps it will beuseful to illustrate this approach to contextualising the mix of continuity andchange.The mid-term review in November 2003, reviewed the progress ofimplementation of various developmental as well as regulatory measures in thebanking sector but emphasised facilitating the ease of transactions by thecommon person and strengthening the credit delivery systems, as a response tothe pressing needs of the society and economy.  The annual policy statement ofMay 2004 carried forward this focus but flagged major areas requiring urgentattention especially in the areas of ownership, governance, conflicts of interestand customer-protection.  Some extracts of the policy statement may be in order:"First, it is necessary to articulate in a comprehensive andtransparent manner the policy in regard to ownership andgovernance of both public and private sector banks keeping in viewthe special nature of banks.  This will also facilitate the ongoing shiftfrom external regulation to internal systems of controls and riskassessments.  Second, from a systemic point of view, inter-relationships between activities of financial intermediaries and areasof conflict of interests need to be considered.  Third, in order toprotect the integrity of the financial system by reducing thelikelihood of their becoming conduits for money laundering, terroristfinancing and other unlawful activities and also to ensure audit trail,greater accent needs to be laid on the adoption of an effectiveconsolidated know your customer (KYC) system, on both assetsand liabilities, in all financial intermediaries regulated by RBI.  At thesame time, it is essential that banks do not seek intrusive detailsfrom their customers and do not resort to sharing of informationregarding the customer except with the written consent of thecustomer.  Fourth, while the stability and efficiency imparted to thelarge commercial banking system is universally recognised, thereare some segments which warrant restructuring."11The annual policy statement for the current year reiterates the concern forcommon person, while enunciating a medium term framework, for developmentof money, forex and government securities markets;  for enhancing credit flow toagriculture and small industry; for action points in technology and paymentssystems; for institutional reform in co-operative banking, non-banking financialcompanies and regional rural banks; and, for ensuring availability of qualityservices to all sections of the population.  The most distinguishing feature of thepolicy statement relates to the availability of banking services to the commonperson, especially depositors.The statement reiterates that depositors’ interests form the focal point ofthe regulatory framework for banking in India, and elaborates the theme asfollows:“A licence to do banking business provides the entity, the ability toaccept deposits and access to deposit insurance for small depositors.Similarly, regulation and supervision by RBI enables these entities toaccess funds from a wider investor base and the payment andsettlement systems provides efficient payments and funds transferservices.  All these services, which are in the nature of public good,involve significant costs and are being made available only to ensureavailability of banking and payment services to the entire populationwithout discrimination”.The policy draws attention to the divergence in treatment of depositorscompared to borrowers as:“ … while policies relating to credit allocation, credit pricing and creditrestructuring should continue to receive attention, it is inappropriate toignore the mandate relating to depositors’ interests.  Further, in ourcountry, the socio-economic profile for a typical depositor who seekssafe avenues for his savings deserves special attention relative toother stakeholders in the banks”.12Another significant area of concern has been the possible exclusion of alarge section of population from the provision of services and the Statementpleads for financial inclusion.  It states:“There has been expansion, greater competition and diversification ofownership of banks leading to both enhanced efficiency and systemicresilience in the banking sector.  However, there are legitimateconcerns in regard to the banking practices that tend to exclude ratherthan attract vast sections of population, in particular pensioners, self-employed and those employed in unorganised sector.  Whilecommercial considerations are no doubt important, the banks havebeen bestowed with several privileges, especially of seeking publicdeposits on a highly leveraged basis, and consequently they should beobliged to provide banking services to all segments of the population,on equitable basis.”Operationally, it has been made clear that RBI will implement policiesto encourage banks which provide extensive services while disincentivisingthose which are not responsive to the banking needs of the community,including the underprivileged.The quality of services rendered has also invited attention in the currentpolicy. I quote further,“Liberalisation and enhanced competition accord immense benefits,but experience has shown that consumers’ interests are notnecessarily accorded full protection and their grievances are notproperly attended to.  Several representations are being received inregard to recent trends of levying unreasonably high service/usercharges and enhancement of user charges without proper and priorintimation. Taking account of all these considerations, it has beendecided by RBI  to set up an independent Banking Codes andStandards Board of India on the model of the mechanism in the UK inorder to ensure that comprehensive code of conduct for fair treatmentof customers are evolved and adhered to”.13It is essential to recognise that, while these constitute contextual nuancedresponses to changing circumstances within the country, the overwhelmingcompulsion to be in harmony with global developments must be respected andthat essentially relates to Basel II.Basel II and IndiaRBI’s association with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision datesback to 1997 as India was among the 16 non-member countries that wereconsulted in the drafting of the Basel Core Principles. Reserve Bank of Indiabecame a member of the Core Principles Liaison Group in 1998 andsubsequently became a member of the Core Principles Working Group onCapital. Within the Working Group, RBI has been actively participating in thedeliberations on the New Accord and had the privilege to lead a group of sixmajor non-G-10 supervisors which presented a proposal on a simplifiedapproach for Basel II to the Committee.Commercial banks in India will start implementing Basel II with effect fromMarch 31, 2007. They will adopt Standardised Approach for credit risk and BasicIndicator Approach for operational risk, initially. After adequate skills aredeveloped, both at the banks and also at supervisory levels, some banks may beallowed to migrate to the Internal Rating Based (IRB) Approach.Let me briefly review the steps taken for implementation of Basel II andthe emerging issues. The RBI had announced in its annual policy statement inMay 2004 that banks in India should examine in depth the options availableunder Basel II and draw a road-map by end-December 2004 for migration toBasel II and review the progress made at quarterly intervals. The Reserve Bankorganized a two-day seminar in July 2004 mainly to sensitise the Chief ExecutiveOfficers of banks to the opportunities and challenges emerging from the Basel IInorms. Soon thereafter all banks were advised in August 2004 to undertake aself-assessment of the various risk management systems in place, with specificreference to the three major risks covered under the Basel II and initiatenecessary remedial measures to update the systems to match up to theminimum standards prescribed under the New Framework. Banks have also14been advised to formulate and operationalise the Capital Adequacy AssessmentProcess (CAAP) within the banks as required under Pillar II of the NewFramework.It is appropriate to list some of the other regulatory initiatives taken by theReserve Bank of India, relevant for Basel II. First, we have tried to ensure thatthe banks have suitable risk management framework oriented towards theirrequirements dictated by the size and complexity of business, risk philosophy,market perceptions and the expected level of capital. Second, Risk BasedSupervision (RBS) in 23 banks has been introduced on a pilot basis. Third, wehave been encouraging banks to formalize their capital adequacy assessmentprocess (CAAP) in alignment with their business plan and performancebudgeting system.  This, together with the adoption of RBS would aid in factoringthe Pillar II requirements under Basel II.   Fourth, we have been expanding thearea of disclosures (Pillar III), so as to have greater transparency in the financialposition and risk profile of banks.  Finally, we have tried to build capacity forensuring the regulator’s ability for identifying and permitting eligible banks toadopt IRB / Advanced Measurement approaches.As per normal practice, and with a view to ensuring migration to Basel II ina non-disruptive manner, a consultative and participative approach has beenadopted for both designing and implementing Basel II. A Steering Committeecomprising senior officials from 14 banks (public, private and foreign) has beenconstituted wherein representation from the Indian Banks’ Association and theRBI has also been ensured. The Steering Committee had formed sub-groups toaddress specific issues. On the basis of recommendations of the SteeringCommittee, draft guidelines to the banks on implementation of the New CapitalAdequacy Framework have been issued.Implementation of Basel II will require more capital for banks in India dueto the fact that operational risk is not captured under Basel I, and the capitalcharge for market risk was not prescribed until recently. Though last year has notbeen a very good year for banks, they are exploring all avenues for meeting thecapital requirements under Basel II. The cushion available in the system, whichhas a CRAR of over 12 per cent now, is, however, comforting.15India has four rating agencies of which three are owned partly/wholly byinternational rating agencies. Compared to developing countries, the extent ofrating penetration has been increasing every year and a large number of capitalissues of companies has been rated.  However, since rating is of issues and notof issuers, it is likely to result, in effect, in application of only Basel I standards forcredit risks in respect of non-retail exposures. While Basel II provides somescope to extend the rating of issues to issuers, this would only be anapproximation and it would be necessary for the system to move to rating ofissuers. Encouraging rating of issuers would be essential in this regard.  In thiscontext, current non-availability of acceptable and qualitative historical datarelevant to ratings, along with the related costs involved in building up andmaintaining the requisite database, does influence the pace of migration to theadvanced approaches available under Basel  II.Above all, capacity building, both in banks and the regulatory bodies is aserious challenge, especially with regard to adoption of the advancedapproaches. We in India have initiated supervisory capacity-building measures toidentify the gaps and to assess as well as quantify the extent of additional capitalwhich may be required to be maintained by such banks. The magnitude of thistask, which is scheduled to be completed by December 2006, appears dauntingsince we have as many as 90 scheduled commercial banks in India.16Concluding ObservationsIn the current scenario, banks are constantly pushing the frontiers of riskmanagement. Compulsions arising out of increasing competition, as well asagency problems between management, owners and other stakeholders areinducing banks to look at newer avenues to augment revenues, while trimmingcosts. Consolidation, competition and risk management are no doubt critical tothe future of banking but I believe that governance and financial inclusion wouldalso emerge as the key issues for a country like India, at this stage of socio-economic development.Once again, let me thank Governor Husain for his kind invitation and theaudience for their patient hearing.Thank you.
