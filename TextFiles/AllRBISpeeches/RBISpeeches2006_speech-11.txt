????Payment and Settlement Systems : Select issuesDirector Shri Sharma, Mr. Hollandars, Mr. O’Connor, Mr. Shigang, Ms. Christova,Mr. Beau and distinguished participants and Ladies and Gentlemen,It is my pleasure to be with you this evening to deliver the valedictoryaddress at the Regional Payment and Settlement Systems Workshop organisedjointly by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS). Participants from the central banks of 16 countries from Africaand Asia have attended this workshop and we had the privilege of having theguest speakers from the Bank of Canada, People’s Bank of China, BIS and BankDe France, apart from the speakers from the RBI. The schedule of the workshopindicates that a wide gamut of subjects relating to the management of paymentsystems has been deliberated upon in the workshop from different countryperspectives. The association of the BIS in organising the workshop as also inproviding faculty support would have certainly enriched the deliberations of theworkshop.I am thankful to the organisers for giving me this opportunity to share mythoughts with you in regard to certain issues relating to the payment andsettlement systems.A major challenge for countries like India relates to the need for achievingefficiency in situations where large-scale increases in the quantum andcomplexity of processing of financial transactions occur. Consider the followingscenario: Today’s customers are more demanding than ever before; they haveaccess to the latest information and have a wide array of options to choose from.Each customer would yearn for the best product or service at the least possiblecost. Against this backdrop, efficiency has become critical if the payment system                                           ? Valedictory address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the RegionalPayment Systems Workshop organised jointly by the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank forInternational Settlements at Hyderabad on October 20, 2006.2has to generate a high degree of customer confidence. Hence, ensuring safe andexpeditious movement of funds at an optimal cost is the key to success of allpayment system reforms.Another challenge faced by the central banks relates to the explosion oftechnology which has made deep inroads into payment and settlement systems.The integration of many hitherto distinct markets is taking place at anunprecedented pace due to advancements in technology. Technologyimplementation poses a myriad of issues and options, such as : the choice ofoptimal technology; the costs of its implementation; the high rate of technologicalobsolescence and the need for periodical updation; the advantages and risks ofoutsourcing; and the convergence of technologies.The relatively late adoption of technology by us and the recent initiation ofreforms in payment and settlement systems have in some way proved to be asort of blessing in disguise by enabling us to take advantage of the experience ofthe innovators. However, much will depend on the capability to leap frog to thestate-of-the-art payment and settlement systems. Given the high rate oftechnology absorption witnessed in the recent past in our region, there is reasonto be optimistic that the challenges will be met successfully.One of the recent technical advances which has had a significant positiveimpact on the payment systems relates to the chip-based processing. Smart cardchip-impregnated cards have made their presence felt everywhere. Thesedevices are now used for card-based access control, identity documentsincluding driving licences, health cards, phone cards, etc., but their real potentiallies in storing monetary value for settlement purposes. These cards can also beused for storing account details, especially for small customers where the cost ofservicing them through branch-based banking would be rather high, as also forenabling the stored value to be used for payment for goods and servicespurchased by the card holder. One of the advantages of these cards is the built-                                                                                                                                 3in authentication mechanism which ensures that only the authorised user is ableto utilise the card or its contents. These cards can deliver services such as bio-metric authorisation and digital signatures while providing the convenience ofusage to the card holders. Finally, the integration of these smart cards with themobile phones, I understand, holds exciting promises for the future.Another related issue is that with a much deeper penetration of mobiletelephony across all strata of the society, whether the paper-based paymentsystem, a legacy of the past, needs to continue in the same manner. Perhaps,the payment and settlement chain may soon witness a sea change with the bankaccount transaction being initiated through a mobile phone, followed, within a fewseconds, by the inter-bank settlement effected in central bank money. If andwhen that happens, the benefits would accrue to all concerned.Closely related to the above is the need for the benchmarks not only tomeasure performance but also to provide a standard for the participants in thesystem. In a world of inter-operability, necessitated by multiple delivery offerings,the co-existence of varied systems is already a reality. This underlines the needfor standards to be evolved, based on international benchmarks, but adapted tothe local requirements. Such benchmarks could also be quite useful in securingcompliance with the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering(AML) norms, monitoring of intricate cross-country financial flows as also theoperational efficiency of each system in a country.Let me now dwell a little on certain facets of effective payment andsettlement systems. The introduction of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)System by many countries has not only resulted in compliance with the CorePrinciples for Systemically Important Payment Systems enumerated by the BIS,Basle but has also paved the way for risk-free, credit push-based fund transferssettled on a real time basis and in the central bank money. However, the liquidityrequirements for the RTGS are relatively high. Hence, the options are beingweighed as to whether the liquidity requirements can be tackled by the banks in a4cost-effective manner without losing the benefits of the RTGS. A judicious mix ofnetting coupled with the RTGS, or a guaranteed net settlement are some of themeasures which would obviate the risks involved in the Deferred Net SettlementSystems (DNS). While the RTGS holds great promise, it is possible that thetechnological as well as institutional aspects may result in considerable problemsduring the phase of transition. Our experience with RTGS shows that there are immense benefits but itspopularity itself can give rise to some operational issues when the system isstabilising. Recently, delays in closing the books by the end of the day have beenreported. I am informed that several experts are working on the system to resolvethe problems. We are according highest priority to tackle these operationalissues that have cropped up in the recent past.I take this opportunity to endorse what Shri Narayana Murthy, Chairmanand Chief Mentor, Infosys said while speaking at this forum. He said :“According to the RBI, there are about 48,000 public sector bank branchesin the country, of which over 63 per cent are in semi-urban and ruralareas. Though over 70 per cent of the branches have attained 100 percent computerisation, real time gross settlement (RTGS) is available onlyin 23,500, while the national electronic funds transfer covers less than5,000 branches. Hence, integrating semi-urban and rural areas into theelectronic clearing system was critical”.I agree that the coverage of the RTGS undoubtedly needs to be expandedover a period. This would require upscaling of its operations in terms of capacityand speed, for which efficient and effective transition to the RTGS system and itsstabilisation would be essential. It is necessary to explore all the issues in acomprehensive manner that would arise in rapid upscaling of RTGS in ourcountry.5Further, several strategic measures may be necessary to popularise andencourage the use of the RTGS by the financial intermediaries, consistent withthe efficacy and capacity of the RTGS system.  We would, no doubt, be happy togain from your experience and share our experience, in the days to come.We have formulated a ‘Payment and Settlement Systems Vision’document for the use of banks, financial institutions as well as the general public.The vision document outlines the short- and medium-term plans of the ReserveBank for the various payment and settlement systems in the country. The broadcontours outlined in the document enable the banks to plan their initiatives intune with the perspectives laid down in the Vision for the country as a whole.It is noted that the spread and reach of the payment services are oftenconfined to certain sections of the society especially in the early stages ofdevelopment. The provision of payment services by the banks to all and ataffordable rates is an important requirement for a more balanced and equitablesocio-economic development. We, in India, have been attempting an activeapproach towards Financial Inclusion in the recent past. Hence, access to fundstransfer services at economical rates to the vast majority of the country’spopulation would be essential for securing financial inclusion as also for reducingthe dependence on non-banking channels for remittance of funds.  Infact, I agreewith Shri Narayana Murthy when he said :“the retail payment systems need to be improved by developingappropriate applications and user-friendly websites with simple interfacesand local content”.Perhaps knowledge of payment systems could be an element of intensivecampaign for financial education that RBI intends launching soon.An aspect closely related to the above is the need for providing adequatelegal backing for transaction processing in a high-technology environment. Mostof the countries in the world have a supporting legal framework in place for thepurpose, while several others are in the process of enacting statutes to meet the6requirements of a technology-driven processing environment. In view of thelarge-scale and rapid advances in technology, we are trying to ensure that thelegal framework in our country is not lagging behind the developments intechnology. While the Payment and Settlement Systems Bill, 2006 is underconsideration of the Parliament, the oversight of payment and settlement systemwas initiated under the RBI (Board for Regulation and Supervision of Paymentand Settlement Systems) Regulations, 2005, which have been framed under thestatutory provisions of the RBI Act. As and when the Payment and SettlementSystems Bill is enacted in the Parliament, the enactment would provide aspecified and dedicated legal foundation for the regulation and supervision of thepayment and settlement systems as also legal recognition to netting proceduresin the country.Given the nature of developments in payment and settlement systems andthe role played by the Information Technology, we would all stand to gain if weshare our experiences amongst ourselves. While the expositions such as thisseminar provide a valuable platform for exchange of views, ideas andinformation, it would be beneficial if we keep the communication channels goingeven after we return to our respective places, in the true spirit of internationalcooperation.I am confident that together we would not only successfully meet thechallenges before us but also implement optimal payment and settlementsystems for the benefit of our countrymen.Thank you.
