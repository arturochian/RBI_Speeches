????Banking and Financial Sector Reforms : Status and ProspectsRespected Prime Minister Sir, Shri Vineet Jain, Honourable ShriChidambaram, Dr. Rangarajan, Shri Ahluwalia, leaders of industry andfinance, and friends,I am thankful to the organisers for according me the privilege ofparticipating in this panel discussion.My comments are divided into three parts - personal, present status,and prospects for Banking and Financial Sector Reforms.On the personal front, I have worked closely with all the distinguishedpanelists here and hence, would like to publicly acknowledge my deep debt ofgratitude.I have been working with Dr. Manmohan Singh, our Prime Minister, invarious capacities, starting in 1977 as his Deputy Secretary in the financeministry and more closely since the initiation of reforms. Let me be very briefand say that I have always been inspired by his vision and guidance. I amgrateful to him for the continued trust in me.I have known Montek for about twenty-five years and had worked withhim closely for sometime during the reform period. One is inevitablyimpressed with his sharp intellect and admirable articulation. We have beenfriends and have deep respect for each others’ professional abilities.Dr. C. Rangararjan is my guru – a guru in the true Indian tradition. Hemade me more of an economist than I could ever dream of. The conceptualframework and intellectual as well institutional foundations for the unique andimpressive reforms in the monetary-fiscal, financial, and external sectors werelaid by him.                                           ? Comments by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Panel Discussion on“15 Years of Reforms and the Road Ahead” convened on the occasion of “The EconomicTimes Awards for Corporate Excellence 2006-07” on October 6, 2006 at National Centre forPerforming Arts, Mumbai.2His successor Dr. Jalan refined and nuanced the framework not onlyfor taking these reforms forward but also for managing threats to stability. Dr.Jalan’s contribution to exchange rate management is admittedly legendary.I worked with Shri Chidambaram, initially, when he was the CommerceMinister and later when he was the Union Finance Minister.  We continue towork together closely and it is a delight to have discussions with him knowingfully well that the outcome would be a better policy.Shri Chidambaram is bold, decisive, and effective. Striking examples ofthese qualities are his decisions relating to gold liberalisation and theintroduction of the system of the ways and means advance, which were thecritical prerequisites for the evolution of money, government securities andforex markets.I recall that when I joined as Governor three years ago, I emphasisedthe continuity and change aspects of the policy. This is a definingcharacteristic of the Indian reforms, which have been described as cautious.Shri Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister, and Shri Jaswant Singh, who wasthen the Finance Minister, supported this approach. Shri Singh providedstrategic guidance and put full trust in my professional skills and judgment.In fact, I believe that, over the fifteen years of reforms, all our leaderswith their diverse backgrounds, and their varied qualities, have contributed toan economic policy in India that has given us some pride today and greathope for tomorrow.On the present status of the banking sector, admittedly, there is scopefor considerable improvement. Yet, its strength and resilience in ensuringgrowth and stability have been recognised universally. In the major emergingeconomies, we compare favourably in the services sector and are seeking tocompete in the manufacturing sector while we try to catch up on the fiscal andinfrastructural fronts. However, it is in the financial and banking sectors thatwe are unarguably ahead.3Our banking sector reform has been unique in the world in that itcombines a comprehensive reorientation of competition, regulation andownership in a non-disruptive and cost-effective manner. Indeed our bankingreform is a good illustration of the dynamism of the public sector in managingthe overhang problems and the pragmatism of public policy in enabling thedomestic and foreign private sectors to compete and expand.Similarly, the financial sector of India as a whole exhibits vibrancy andresilience. The government securities, money and forex markets havesignificant public policy implications for a gradually-opening emerging marketeconomy. These have developed during the reform period, with impressivediversification of participants and instruments.The institutional, technical, and micro-structural aspects of the Indianfinancial sector are in alignment with the best global standards. Here, againprogress achieved in financial sector is a testimony to the healthy evolutionthrough mutual cooperation amongst government, monetary authority,regulators, and above all, diverse market participants – domestic and foreign,in public as well as in private sector.Reflecting on future prospects in banking, immediate focus has to beon the cleaning up of the remnants of undercapitalised banks, whileconcentrating on improvements in the rural co-operative credit system. It isalso necessary to ensure improvements in their governance and financialmanagement. In the banking system as a whole, a healthy credit cultureencompassing appropriate pricing, quality of service, financial inclusion andcontract-enforcement would be vital.While the larger corporates have already acquired considerablefreedom in accessing funds from a variety of sources such as banks, non-banks, capital markets, and external resources, the small and mediumenterprises, agriculture sector, artisans and the informal sector as a whole,remain to be demonstrably benefited.4For the way ahead, for the financial sector as whole, given the strongfoundations and basic institutional framework, the issues relate to the pace offurther deregulation and liberalisation, consistent with the progress of reformin the real and fiscal sectors. In practice, within the given legal framework,priorities have to be formulated to ensure implementation in tune with theevolving domestic and external developments.The Reserve Bank of India has, in the service of our country, a proventrack record and professionalism, which have lent it considerable credibility -both domestically and globally. This credibility enables the RBI to confidentlycarry the reforms forward to credibly maintain price and financial stability,while enabling self-accelerating equitable growth at elevated levels.Thank you.
