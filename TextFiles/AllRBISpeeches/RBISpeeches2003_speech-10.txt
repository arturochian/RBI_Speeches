1Financing for Entrepreneurship and SMEs : An Indian Perspective I am indeed thankful to OECD for inviting me as speaker at this important workshop on“Entrepreneurship in a Global Economy”. In my address, I shall share with you some of theinitiatives that are being taken by the Indian authorities with regard to the Small Scale Industries(SSI), against the backdrop of the SME financing in a cross-country perspective.In view of the continuing financing problems of the SMEs, at least two broad approaches havebeen adopted at the national level viz.,(i) facilitating access of SMEs to extant sources of financing and(ii) developing newer sources of financing in terms of venture capital and business anglenetworks.As far as existing sources of financing are concerned, the trend is towards reduced and moreflexible loan schemes as well as loan guarantees. Competitive markets and a deregulated interestrate regime generally ensure that interest rates on guaranteed loans (including guaranteepremium) are relatively low.With regard to newer sources of financing, many OECD countries are considering liberalizingthe rules regarding venture capital investment.. On-going research at the OECD indicates thateffective venture capital policies include diversifying venture investors, channeling venturecapital to seed firms in growth sectors and phasing out of Government equity schemes as privatemarkets develop.Like any other developing countries, in India also, the Small Scale Industry (SSI) plays a verysignificant role in terms of balanced and sustainable growth, employment generation,development of entrepreneurial skills and contribution to export earnings. As at the end of March2002, there were around 3.6 million SSI units - constituting 95 per cent of the industrial units inthe country - which produced a large number and a wide range of items with associatedtechnology varying from traditional to state-of-art. These SSI units provided employment tonearly 20 million persons, accounted for 40 per cent of the value added in the manufacturingsector, 34 per cent of total national exports and 7 per cent of GDP during 2002-03.In the Indian context, the definition of the SSI sector is largely framed in terms of cumulativeinvestment in plant and machinery while most of the countries adopt the level of employment asthe criterion for defining the SSI sector. According to the official definition adopted in Indiasince 1998, the investment limit up to Rs.10 million in plant and machinery is treated as SSIsector. However, in respect of certain specified items such as hosiery, handtools, drugs &pharmaceuticals and stationary items above  investment limit in plant and machinery has beenenhanced up to Rs.50 million. Since 1967, there is a policy of reserving selected products in themanufacturing sector for exclusive production in the SSI sector.  The list of reserved items hasbeen revised from time-to-time.The policy initiatives in India have always recognised that SSIs contribute to the materialprogress of the country. Small firms are capable of producing a larger quantum of consumergoods than before to meet the possible increase in demand that would arise on account of thespurt in incomes, generated by fresh investments in heavy and basic industries. It is also takenfor granted that small firms would, in the process, create additional employment opportunities.Implicit also is the assumption that SSIs are less capital intensive and more labour absorbing.                                                1 Address by Mr.Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at OECD “Workshop onEntrepreneurship in a Global Economy : Strategic Issues and Policies” at Budapest in the panel “Identifying the RealPolicy Issues” in the Session on “Improving Financing for Entrepreneurship and SMEs” on September 9, 20032This is regarded as an important gain of promoting SSIs, given the country’s resourceendowments, namely labour abundance and scarcity of capital.Among the developing countries, India was the first to display special consideration to SSIs. Asalluded to earlier, the basic focus of Indian Government has been that, employment generation isof paramount importance in a labour surplus economy. Small enterprises manufacturing labour-intensive products make economical use of capital and absorb the abundant labour supply thatcharacterise an underdeveloped economy. Various measures used for the development of SSIhave included product reservations, fiscal concessions, preferential allocations of credit andinterest subsidy in a credit rationing framework, extension of business and technical services bythe government and preferential procurement by the government. SSIs have been givenpreferential treatment through the provision of lower interest rates as well as requirement for aminimum credit allocation from the commercial banks. Since 1986, fiscal incentives have alsobeen provided to the SSI units in terms of complete exemption from excise duties or payment oflower rates, under specified conditions. Since April 1995, SSI units are allowed a deduction of25 per cent of the profits for a period of ten years, for taxation purpose. In case the SSI units setup in specified backward area, full tax exemption is allowed for the first five years and adeduction of 25 per cent in the subsequent five years.In recognition of the contribution and the vast potential of the SSI sector as well as its inherentinfirmities, provision of adequate credit to this sector has continued to be an important elementof banking policy, even though economic and financial policies themselves have undergonesignificant transformation, particularly after the initiation of structural reforms in 1991. Bankcredit to the SSI sector increased from Rs.168 billion in March 1991 to Rs.530 billion in March2003.In the policy context, there has been a paradigm shift. The Indian industry remained within ainward oriented policy framework upto the 1990s. With globalisation, liberalization, financialand real sector reforms, the country adopted an outward looking approach. At present, both theindustrial sector in general and SSI sector in particular are exposed to international competitiveenvironment. However, the most significant aspect is that India has evolved a sound institutionalset up for financing of the SSI sector. A separate industrial policy was announced as part of thestructural reforms in 1991 which not only eliminated various controls on the industrial sector,provided a greater role for the private sector and encouraged inflow of foreign investment andtechnology, but also contained specific initiatives for the development of the SSI sector. Theintroduced a comprehensive policy package which includes fiscal, credit, infrastructural andtechnological.  Now the emphasis is on quality improvement, marketing and streamliningregulations.There are multiple institutions in the public, private and cooperative sectors of the Indianeconomy that cater to the credit needs of the SSI sector, both for fixed assets creation as well asfor working capital. Consequent to the nationalisation of major banks in 1969, banking policymandated that at least 40 per cent of bank credit should be directed towards the priority sectorconstituting agriculture, SSI and individual service and business sectors. Preferential treatmentwas also provided to the SSI sector via lower rates of interest on bank credit. The SmallIndustries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) was set up in April 1990 as the principalfinancial institution for promotion, financing and development of the SSI sector and forcoordinating the activities of other institutions engaged in similar activities. A Fair PracticesCode has also been adopted by SIDBI which, inter-alia, clearly sets out the procedures thatwould be followed in respect of loan applications, appraisals and disbursements. In order toboost investment in SSI sector, the benefits of exemption of capital gains arising from thetransfer of long-term capital assets are allowed if such capital gains are invested in bonds by theSmall Scale Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) with effect from April 2002.3A Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Small Industries has been launched and the SIDBI set upthe Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Small Industries (CGTSI), to implement the GuaranteeScheme. The main objective of CGTSI is to facilitate hassle-free credit to the SSI sector andencourage banks to shift from collateral-based or security-oriented lending to. The CGTSI is inthe process of developing a Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme (MCGS) on the lines of similarschemes in Italy and other European countries; such schemes essentially involve a guaranteefrom industry associations in which the borrower is also a member which, in turn, enhances thelender’s confidence. The SIDBI has also encouraged the growth of the venture capital industryfor hi-tech SME units in India by promoting 13 State / regional level funds and setting up an allIndia Venture Fund.The Government of India had launched many Schemes for technological upgradation andmodernisation, protection of workers affected by technological upgradation and modernisation,infrastructure development, entrepreneurship development, as well as increase in the investmentlimit (to Rs.50 million) for SSI units producing certain items. The Government of India set up anew Ministry in October 1999 to provide more focussed attention to the development of the SSIsector. Several expert committees had also been set up over the 1990s to assess the problems ofthe SSI sector. Most of the recommendations of these Committees relating to simplification ofloan application forms, launching of a new Credit Guarantee Scheme, raising of composite loans,etc have been accepted and implemented. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also been emphasising on the flow of bank credit to microenterprises in rural and semi-urban areas set up by vulnerable sections of society includingwomen. A number of initiatives have been taken in this regard and banks have been advised toprovide maximum support to Self Help Groups. Furthermore, four informal Groups have beenset up by the RBI to analyse various micro-finance issues relating to (i) structure andsustainability; (ii) funding; (iii) regulations; and (iv) capacity-building. The RBI will discuss therecommendations of the informal Groups in a wider forum for possible implementation.The SSI sector has so far been resilient to the impact of the policy changes - increasing domesticand foreign competition following the de-reservation and import liberalisation of items as well asthe relatively high interest rates- and has withstood the general deceleration in the industrialsector during 1997-98 to 2002-03. It has been well recognised that the investment limit of Rs.10million for the remaining SSI units leaves little scope for such producers to achieve economies ofscale and scope and become competitive. Today, it is, in fact, incentive-compatible for SSI unitsto remain deliberately small - by fragmenting production - in order to avail of fiscal benefits andto stay outside the purview of labour laws. The pace of de-reservation of SSI items, therefore,needs to be accelerated so as to ensure that size does not remain a constraint to higherproduction, cost-efficiency and technological upgradation.Let me now focus on the major problems/challenges faced by the SSI sector which areenumerated as under:CollateralThe limit for collateral free loans to tiny sector is Rs. 0.5million and that for other SSI units wasRs. 0.1 million. This limit has since been raised to Rs. 0.5 million for other SSI units also. Manysmall-scale entrepreneurs are facing difficulties in providing collateral security as per therequirements of the financing banks. The limit of 0.5 million has been further increased to Rs.1.5million in respect of SSI units with good track record and financial position. The problem isaddressed to a certain extent with the introduction of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust Schemeunder which collateral free loans up to a limit of Rs. 2.5 million are guaranteed.4Cost of LoansThe high cost of borrowings was a major constraint affecting the growth of the sector. The BankRate changes by the RBI combined with CRR and repo rate charges have emerged as signallingdevices for interest rate changes. The reduction in Bank rate announced in the last Monetary andCredit Policy or outside the policy from time to time has resulted in a consequential reduction inthe lending rates. Banks have now the flexibility to offer lending rates on a fixed rate or on afloating rate. The reduction in interest rates and the offer of floating rates will help the SSI unitsto procure funds at lower costs than what was prevailing in earlier years.Delayed PaymentsConsiderable delay in settlement of dues/payment of bills by the large-scale buyers to the SSIunits adversely affected the recycling of funds and business operation of SSI units. Though theGovernment has enacted the Delayed Payments Act, many of the SSI units are reluctant topursue cases against major buyers. The Act since amended in 1998 has made it compulsory thatthe payment of SSI suppliers should be made within 120 days. To improve the plight of SSIentrepreneurs due to delayed payments, steps for strengthening and popularizing factoringservices, without recourse to the SSI suppliers may have to be thought of seriously.The banks have also been advised about sub-allotting overall limits to the large borrowersspecifically for meeting the payment obligations in respect of purchases from SSI. It is expectedthat these measures will improve the situation of delayed payments.MarketingMarketing remains the most critical  area for the SSI Sector as some of the units are very smalland so is their output individually. Adopting consortium approach could best solve the marketingproblems of the SSI sector. Besides finance for marketing related activities, dissemination ofrequisite information on demand pattern, futuristic trend, etc. could be made available by theDevelopment Institutions/SSI Associations, etc.Challenges emanating from the WTOTo face the challenges emanating from the WTO agreement, SSI units irrespective of their sizeneed technology up-gradation and modernisation. An awareness about the implications of WTOagreement has to be created. The preparation for competitiveness needs to be done by theGovernment as well as entrepreneurs and the corporate. The Government should provide goodinfrastructure and create level playing field for the industry. Considering the fund constraintswith SSI Sector Government has introduced the credit linked capital subsidy scheme forTechnology up gradation of Small Scale Industries under which 12% back ended capital subsidywould be admissible on the loans advanced to the SSIs by banks/financial institutions fortechnology up gradation in certain select sectors.SicknessGrowing incidence of sickness of SSIs is yet another area of concern. When the sicknessprolongs it leads to the closure of units and unemployment. Lately mortality of the SSI units hasbeen showing increasing trend. This has wider implications including locking of funds of thelending institutions, loss of scarce material resources and loss of employment. The number ofsick SSI units as a percentage to the total number of SSI units is around 10. The number of unitsidentified as potentially viable as a percentage to total sick SSI units is around 8. The causes ofsickness are both internal and external. The major causes are limited financial resources, lack oforganisational, financial and management skills and expertise, diversion of funds,diversification/expansion before stabilisation, non-availability of power supply shortage of rawmaterials, marketing difficulties, delayed and inadequate credit, globalisation and liberalisationof the economy, obsolete technology, inadequate infrastructure, etc. With a view to ensuring that5potentially viable sick SSI units are provided with the timely and adequate assistance by allagencies concerned, there are State Level Inter Institutional Committees (SLIIC) constituted ineach state involving State Government, Financial institutions, commercial banks and SIDBI. SSIAssociations are also invited to the meetings of this committee. A sub-committee of SLIIC hasalso been set up in each state to examine the individual cases referred to it for rehabilitation. Toaddress the incidence of growing sickness in the sector RBI has recently issued a complete set ofrevised guidelines drawn up on the basis of the recommendations of a Working Groupconstituted by it for the purpose.Policy InitiativesThe Indian industry remained within an inward oriented policy framework up to the 1990s. Withglobalisation, liberalization, financial and real sector reforms, the country adopted an outwardlooking approach. At present, both the industrial sector in general and SSI sector in particular areexposed to international competitive environment. However, the most significant aspect is thatIndia has evolved a sound institutional set up for financing of the SSI sector. New industrialpolicy was announced as part of the structural reforms in 1991, which eliminated variouscontrols on the industrial sector, provided a greater role for the private sector and encouragedinflow of foreign investment and technology, but also contained specific initiatives for thedevelopment of the SSI sector.The pace of de-reservation of SSI items, needs to be accelerated so as to ensure that size does notremain a constraint to higher production, cost-efficiency and technological upgradation. The casefor de-reservation of the SSI sector becomes even stronger in the light of the experience ofSouth-East Asian economies which indicates that (a) their export basket transformed fromlabour-intensive and relatively low technology products (textiles, clothing, shoes, toys, etc) in the1980s to higher-technology consumer goods and capital-intensive goods (capital goods andpetrochemicals) in the 1990s and (b) production of such consumer goods could be achieved bylarge-scale final assembly operations coupled with copious out-sourcing to small enterprises inorder to maintain their competitiveness. Thus, with the de-reservation of the SSI sector in India,a larger number of industrial units would be in a position to exploit the opportunities provided byglobalisation, given the vast potential of exports from this sector.Ministry of SSI under Govt. of India has been laying more emphasis on cluster-based approachfor development of SSI sector. So far Ministry has identified 60 clusters for focuseddevelopment of SSI and banks in these areas are initiating necessary steps to meet their creditrequirements effectively.Future ActionAs the evidence shows, several initiatives are being taken at the national and international levelsto foster the development of SMEs and improve their access to finance. Notwithstanding theseinitiatives, impediments to SME finance remain, in different degrees, in both developed anddeveloping economies, which constitute the single most important factor that could circumscribetheir growth trajectory. Accordingly, the attention of policy makers may need to focus on thefollowing three broad issues, viz., creating a conducive business environment, development ofclusters, and enhancing credit flows to SMEs as these are widely debated in the contemporarydiscussions.Governments need to take initiatives to ensure that the overall policy environment encouragesindustrial activity in general, and SME activity, in particular, given the latter’s significantcontribution to general economic activity in many countries. This would entail efforts tomaintain macroeconomic stability in terms of low fiscal deficits and debts (such that privatesavings are not pre-empted), low and stable inflation, low real rates of interest and a sustainablecurrent account. This apart, initiatives would need to be taken, wherever necessary, to removeoutdated and anomalous restrictions on domestic production, bring about a reduction in tariff and6tax rates to internationally competitive levels, create a competitive environment throughappropriate legislation, if necessary provide public infrastructure support, reduce inflexibilities inthe labour market with due cognizance to the need for appropriate social safety nets and invokenecessary reforms in bankruptcy and exit procedures. Streamlining of procedures to disburseloans to SMEs, creating a regulatory/legal framework that ensures timely payment of dues toSMEs, providing technical training to staff of financial institutions and organising generalawareness programmes on SME financing would also be necessary. These measures would notonly encourage SME activity but also have a salutary impact on their efficiency and hence, ontheir overall requirements of finance.Newer forms of SME financing need to be fostered viz., venture capital and leasing. Commercialbanks and local government funding agencies would need to play a major role in venture capitalfinancing while insurance funds and pension funds could be tapped as important sources offinance. Leasing, on the other hand, requires a less rigorous legal and regulatory framework vis-à-vis bank lending, since the leasing company retains the ownership of assets till the end of thelease.  Even so, strengthening of leasing laws, encouraging banks and financial institutions tosupport leasing companies and appropriate training through technical assistance would helpfoster the development of this alternative important source of finance for SMEs.In conclusion major problems/challenges faced by SSI sector in India are  :• availability of collateral free loans• cost of loans• delayed payments• marketing• Challenges emanating from WTO related issues• sicknessA number of steps have been initiated to promote the healthy growth of SSI Sector. However, toensure the prospects of these enterprises, SMEs, in the coming years will have to gear up to facethe challenges of liberalisation. I am confident that given the inherent strength, the sector willdevelop a global vision, respond to more demanding standards of the customers and adopt keystrategies that could take them ahead in competition. Credit should not be a constraint for viableprojects.I believe that the workshop would bring out valuable policy recommendations for shaping futurepolicy initiatives.1 Address by Mr.Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at OECD “Workshop onEntrepreneurship in a Global Economy : Strategic Issues and Policies” at Budapest in the panel “Identifying the RealPolicy Issues” in the Session on “Improving Financing for Entrepreneurship and SMEs” on September 9, 2003
