Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Frameworks:The Indian Experience*Rakesh MohanI would like to congratulate the International Monetary Fund and MonetaryAuthority of Singapore for holding this Second High Level Seminar on Asian FinancialIntegration.   This forum provides a good opportunity for all of us to exchange notes,ideas and views on the continuously evolving texture of the international financialarchitecture, particular as it affects Asia and as Asian financial growth itself impactsthe rest of the world.  The international financial landscape today is clearly much morecomplex than it has been in previous decades.  In each of our countries monetarypolicy making has become a delicate balancing act between the imperatives ofdomestic economic, financial and monetary concerns and the evolving internationalsituation that we have to observe closely on a real time basis and to take it as a given.The rapid changes that technological change, financial innovation and globalisationhave brought to financial markets are also forces at work that have to be takenaccount of. We are all living through interesting times, but our job as central bankers isperhaps to make the world less interesting through the implementation of policies thatensure monetary and financial stability!Indian economic reforms that have been in process now for a decade and ahalf seem to have propelled us to a higher growth path of 8 per cent plus GDP growth.Our challenge in monetary policy making now is to ensure that such a growth path canbe preserved, or further accelerated, while we provide a macro-economic environmentthat is characterised by monetary, price and financial stability. As I will documentfurther, among the changes that we have gone through in the last decade and a half, akey transformation is the increasing openness of the Indian economy. Within that, oureconomic relationships with the rest of Asia are also intensifying through sustainedexpansion in trade and hence in financial relationships as well. Given the emergingeconomic demographics in the world, and the shifting economic weight towards Asia,we are very conscious of the need for increasing integration in Asia and how our ownrole will evolve in the coming years.Each of the Asian countries has experienced significant changes in theoperation of monetary policy in an open economy framework in recent years.Whereas we do face many similar problems, particularly through the impact ofinternational developments such as the international crude oil price hikes, domesticdevelopments continue to carry greater weight in most of our economies in ourmonetary and macro-economic management approaches.  I, therefore, thought thatthe best thing that I can do today to facilitate discussion is to provide a brief descriptionand evaluation of India's experience as we have implemented significant structuralchanges in the framework of monetary and exchange rate management in anincreasingly market oriented and open economy.I. Changes in the Monetary Policy FrameworkIn the aftermath of a balance of payments crisis in 1991, stabilization wasundertaken simultaneously with structural reforms over wide areas of the Indianeconomy.  This dramatic change in context fundamentally altered the manner in whichmonetary policy began to be formulated.                                                * Presentation by Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Second High Level Seminar on AsianFinancial Integration organised by the International Monetary Fund and Monetary Authority of Singaporein Singapore on May 25, 2006. The assistance of Michael Patra, Himanshu Joshi, Rajib Das and ParthaRay in preparation of the address is gratefully acknowledged.First, given the reality of multiple goals assigned to the monetary authority, theachievement of macroeconomic and price stability received greater emphasis.  Thusthe overall objective has had to be approached in a flexible and time variant mannerwith a continuous rebalancing of priority between growth and price stability, dependingon underlying macroeconomic and financial conditions. As we observed the severecosts of financial instability elsewhere, financial stability has ascended the hierarchy ofmonetary policy objectives since the second half of the 1990s.  Strong synergies andcomplementarities are observed between price stability and financial stability in India.Accordingly, we believe that regulation, supervision and development of the financialsystem remain within the legitimate ambit of monetary policy broadly interpreted.Second, the operating framework of monetary policy underwent atransformation during the 1990s.  A variety of administered interventions in interestrates and bank credit flow characteristic of the 1970s and 1980s gave way in the early1990s to a brief period of broad monetary policy rules or ‘monetary targeting withfeedback’.  From the second half of the 1990s, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)switched to a multiple indicator approach in which high frequency and low frequencyindicators are tracked and the information used to draw policy perspectives.Third, the growing market orientation of monetary policy has tilted the choice ofinstruments decisively from direct to more indirect and market-based monetary policymeasures.  On the eve of reforms, statutory pre-emptions in the form of cash reserveratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirements locked away nearly 70 percent of bank deposits, severely eroding the profitability of the financial system andeffectiveness of monetary policy.  The SLR was brought down from 38.5 per cent ofnet demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in early 1992 to 25 per cent in mid -1994.  TheCRR has been progressively reduced to 5 per cent from 15 per cent in 1991. Fourth, interest rate deregulation was initiated across different segments. InSeptember 1990, all sector-specific and use specific interest rate prescriptions wereabolished except for loans below Rs.200,000 which were subject to a minimum rateprescription. In October 1994, the minimum rate prescription was withdrawn and thelending rates of banks were made free subject to the setting of the prime lending rate(PLR). In 2003, banks were advised to announce a benchmark PLR to transparentlyreflect actual cost of funds. At present, banks enjoy the flexibility of pricing loans andadvances using market benchmarks and time varying spreads in an objective andtransparent manner. Interest rates on a number of loans and advances, includingadvances for acquiring residential properties, purchase of consumer durables and thelike are determined without reference to the benchmark PLR. Although, savings bankdeposit rates continue to be regulated, by 1995, rates on term deposits with maturitiesof over two years were freed. In the following year, rates on deposits of over one yearmaturity were freed. By October 1997, the ceiling on rates on deposits of thirty days toone year maturity period was removed.  Currently, deposit rates for all maturity arefree and the minimum maturity period for term deposits has been reduced to 7 days by2004. Banks can offer differential rates of interest on wholesale domestic termdeposits different from those offered on the retail domestic term deposits.  Interest rateceilings on export credit in foreign currency and non-resident deposits are prescribedbut they are transparently linked to international interest rates. The Reserve Bankprovides information on its website on the range of deposit rates and lending rates.We, thus, made a carefully calibrated transition from an administered interestrate regime to one of market determined interest rates over a period of time, whileminimising disruption and preserving financial stability.  This approach also providedmarket participants adequate time to adjust to the new regime.Interest rate deregulation is essential to smoothen the transmission channels ofmonetary policy and enhance the signaling effects of policy changes. However, somerigidities remain in certain segments hindering the overall efficiency of interest rates inresource allocation. In this context, administered interest rates fixed by theGovernment on a number of small saving schemes and provident funds is of specialrelevance as they generally offer a rate higher than corresponding instrumentsavailable in the market as well as tax incentives. As banks have to compete for fundswith small saving schemes, the rates offered on long-term deposits mobilized by banksset the floor for lending rates at a level higher than would have obtained undercompetitive market conditions. In fact, this has been observed to be a factorcontributing to downward stickiness of lending rates, which has some implications forthe effectiveness of monetary policy.  This is a reality that we have to appreciate andlive with given the absence of social security coverage and adequate safety nets in thecountry. These small savings schemes administered by the government through thewide reach of post offices, and some through commercial banks, provide small saversaccess tax savings instruments that are seen as safe and stable.   Whereas they dohave some impact in terms of blunting monetary transmission mechanisms, they canperhaps be seen as contributing to overall financial stability.  Benchmarking theseadministered interest rates to market determined rates has been proposed from time totime.   Whereas some rationalisation in schemes has indeed been done, moreprogress will depend on the emergence of better social security and pension systems,and perhaps easier access to marketable sovereign instruments.Finally, all sector-specific refinance facilities have been phased out exceptexport credit refinance. A liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) consisting of repo / reverserepo in government securities has emerged since June 2000 as the main operatinginstrument of monetary policy. The LAF serves two objectives. First, it has providedgreater flexibility in addressing day-to-day liquidity mismatches. Second, it sets acorridor for overnight market interest rates, imparting stability in the market. The LAFrates serve as tools for liquidity management as well as signalling of interest rates. Theeffectiveness of LAF has has perceptibly improved the efficacy of monetary policytransmission.The evolution of autonomous monetary policy in the 1990s also depended onthe effective removal of fiscal dominance that had existed earlier through theautomatic monetisation of fiscal deficits.   Over the period 1994-97, this subventionwas phased out by agreement between the government and the RBI, marking aunique milestone in monetary–fiscal coordination.  Another important institutionalchange was the freeing of the RBI’s balance sheet from the burden of exchangeguarantees accumulated in the pre-reform era.Legislative amendments have been carried out, first in 2000 and now in 2006,to strengthen RBI's regulatory jurisdiction over financial markets in terms of theoperations of the forex, money and government securities markets.   These legislativechanges are expected to empower the RBI in terms of instrument independence andhence the effectiveness of monetary policy.   In terms of process, we are alsoproceeding towards greater transparency and consultation, while increasing thefrequency of policy reviews from semi-annual to quarterly.   Alongside thisenhancement in accountability we are also attempting greater transparency incommunicating monetary policy.  Going forward, the key issue, given the institutionalempowerment, is the speed and quality of the transmission of monetary policyimpulses.   This is the subject matter of the following section.   II. Monetary TransmissionConsistent with these structural changes in the monetary policy framework,improvements in the channels of transmission emerged early on as a concurrentobjective in order to enhance policy effectiveness. Accordingly, the RBI simultaneouslyundertook the development of the domestic financial market spectrum, sequenced intothe process of deregulation of interest rates, the withdrawal of statutory pre-emptions,the qualitative improvement in monetary-fiscal coordination and the progressiveliberalisation of the exchange and payments regime, including the institution of amarket oriented exchange rate policy.  The development of financial markets in Indiaencompassed the introduction of new market segments, new instruments and asharper focus on regulatory oversight.The Indian money market was fairly underdeveloped till the mid-1980s;dominated by the overnight segment with a narrow base, limited number ofparticipants and administered interest rates since December 1973. In 1987,participation was widened on the lending side and institutions were set up as marketmakers for the orderly development of the market. Select institutions were allowed toborrow from the money market on a term basis and the ceiling on interest rates waswithdrawn in 1989. New instruments like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and CommercialPaper (CP) were introduced in 1989 and 1990 and interest rates on money marketinstruments became progressively market determined. In 1998, the RBI initiated aprocess of developing the overnight money market into a pure interbank market. Thephasing out of non-banks from the money market was sequenced over the period2000-05. Non-banks (except PDs who are allowed to operate in the overnight market)have largely migrated to the new collateralised markets which were developed inconsonance. Non-banks can now take recourse to collateralised repos outside the RBIfor purposes of borrowing and lending of funds. An innovative money marketinstrument called the Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO) wasintroduced in January 2003, which provides investors the benefit of guaranteedsettlement and an exit option before maturity. Trading volumes in the collateralisedmoney markets have increased substantially. Technological upgradation hasaccompanied the development of the money market. Efforts are currently underway tointroduce screen-based negotiated quote-driven dealings in call/notice and termmoney markets.  Information on overnight rates and volumes would be disseminatedby the RBI in order to enable market participants to assess the liquidity conditions inan efficient and transparent manner.The Indian foreign exchange market has been widened and deepened  with thetransition to a market-determined exchange rate system in March 1993 and thesubsequent liberalisation of restrictions on various external transactions leading up tocurrent account convertibility under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of theInternational Monetary Fund in 1994. Since the mid-1990s, banks and otherauthorised entities have been accorded significant freedom to operate in the market.Banks have been allowed freedom to fix their trading limits and to borrow and investfunds in the overseas markets up to specified limits.  They have been allowed to usederivative products for hedging risks and asset-liability management purposes.Similarly, corporates have been given flexibility to book forward cover based on pastturnover and are allowed to use a variety of instruments like interest rates andcurrency swaps, caps/collars and forward rate agreements. The swap market forhedging longer-term exposure has developed substantially in recent years.  A numberof steps have also been taken to liberalise the capital account covering foreign directinvestment, portfolio investment, outward investment including direct investment aswell as depository receipt and convertible bonds, opening of Indian corporate officesabroad and the like.  In recent years, the Reserve Bank has delegated exchangecontrol procedures to banks and authorised dealers to such an extent that there ishardly any need to approach the Reserve Bank for any approval.  These reforms arebeing reflected in vibrancy in activity in various segments of the foreign exchangemarket with the daily turnover over US $ 33 billion (as at the end of April 2006).The government securities market was moved to an auction-based system in1992 to obtain better price discovery and to impart greater transparency in operations.This was a major institutional change which, along with the freeing of the money andforeign exchange market and the phasing out of automatic monetisation of fiscaldeficits, created a conducive environment for the progressive deregulation that was tofollow. The setting up of well capitalised Primary Dealers (PDs) for dealing inGovernment securities followed in 1995, backed up by the introduction of Deliveryversus Payment (DvP) for Government securities, adoption of new techniques offloatation, introduction of new instruments, particularly Treasury Bills of varyingmaturities and repos on all Central Government dated securities and Treasury Bills ofall maturities by April 1997. It may be mentioned that since April 1992, the entire Central Governmentborrowing programme in dated securities has been conducted through auctions.  In2005 the Reserve Bank has put in place an anonymous order matching system toimprove price discovery, and settlement procedures for mitigating risks. To furtheractivate trading and improve the depth of the securities market, the introduction of a"when issued" market has also been announced recently. All these measures havebrought about significant changes and a new treasury culture is developing,contributing to the formation of the term structure of interest rates.  The demand forgovernment securities is now driven more by considerations of effective managementof liquidity rather than by statutory liquidity requirements. Efforts are being made toimprove the retail holding of government securities since the Government securitiesmarket still lacks in depth and is dominated by banks and financial institutions oftenexhibiting uni-directional perceptions about liquidity. To attract retail participation ingovernment securities market, one of the foremost tasks ahead is to create anenvironment that provides a safe and secure investment avenue for small investorswith adequate returns and liquidity. In this context, the RBI is emphasising theprovision of demat holding facility for non-institutional retail/small investors for riskmitigation in scrip losses or settlement of deals in the secondary market. Non-competitive bidding has also been introduced since January 2002 for direct access tothe primary issues for non-sophisticated investors.The corporate debt market in India has been in existence since independencein 1947.  It was only since the mid - 1980s, however, that state owned publicenterprises (PSUs) began issuing bonds. In the absence of a well functioningsecondary market, such debt instruments have remained highly illiquid and unpopularamong the investing population at large. Corporates continue to prefer privateplacements to public issues for raising resources. The dominance of privateplacement can be attributed to several factors, viz., ease of procedures and operationof private placement, considerably higher costs of public issues, and highersubscriptions for private placements. Financial institutions have tended to dominatepublic issues in the primary corporate debt market. The secondary market forcorporate debt has suffered from lack of market making resulting in poor liquidity, anda tendency on the part of institutional investors to hold securities to maturity andconsequent reduction in market supply of securities.Several measures have been taken in the recent past to transform thecorporate debt market in India. Some of these measures include de-materialisationand electronic transfer of securities, rolling settlement, introduction of sophisticatedrisk management, trading and settlement systems. Towards the end of 2003, stepswere also taken to reform the private placement market. All these measures areexpected to improve the functioning of the corporate debt market in India.  It needs tobe recognised, however, that it has been difficult to develop the corporate bondmarket everywhere.  Just under half the world’s corporate bond market is in the US,and another 15 per cent in Japan.   Among other countries, the UK has a longstanding bond market, but the European one is still developing.  Among developingcountries, it is perhaps only South Korea that has a reasonably well developed bondmarket.  The corporate debt market in India has a large potential to raise resourcesparticularly for infrastructure projects, housing and for corporate and municipal needs.Appropriate institutional processes, development of various market segmentsincluding for mortgage – backed securities and bond insurance institutions for creditenhancement, easing cost and abridgment of disclosure requirements for listedcompanies, rating requirements for unlisted companies, a suitable framework formarket making, consolidation, centralized data base on primary issues for wider publicinformation, real time trade reporting system for dissemination of information, accessto RTGS and state of the art technology would provide a strong impetus for corporatebond markets to grow in India.A key area of emphasis in the development of financial markets in India is theprovision of the appropriate technological infrastructure for trading, clearing, paymentand settlement.  Since the late 1990s, the establishment of a modern, robustpayments and settlement system consistent with international best practices hasemerged as an important objective of the RBI. A three-pronged strategy ofconsolidation, development and integration is pursued in this regard.  Consolidationrevolves around strengthening the existing payment system by providing the latestlevels of technology.  The developmental dimension includes real time grosssettlement, centralised funds management, securities settlement and structuredfinancial messaging.  Other key elements in the technological content of marketdevelopment are electronic clearing (introduced in 1994), electronic finds transfer(1996), quick funds transfers with centralized settlement in Mumbai (2003), negotiateddealing system (NDS), screen based order matching system (2002) for electronicreporting of trades and online dissemination system and submission of bids forprimary issuance of government securities and a Clearing Corporation of India Ltd.(CCIL), promoted by banks, financial institutions and primary dealers for clearing andsettlement of trades in foreign exchange, government securities and other debtinstruments, commenced operations in April 2001.  The CCIL acts as a centralcounterparty (CCP) to all transactions and guarantees settlement of trades executedthrough its rules and regulations eliminating counterparty risks in adherence tointernational best practices.  Oversight over the payments and settlement system isvested in a National Payments Council, and Board for Payment and SettlementSystems established within the RBI.As may be seen from this brief description of the various measures that had tobe taken to develop the market and institutional framework for efficient monetary policytransmission, development of markets is an arduous and time consuming activity thatrequires conscious policy making and implementation.   Markets do not develop andfunction overnight: they have to be created, nurtured and monitored on a continuousbasis before they start functioning autonomously.III. Exchange Rate ManagementThe regime shift in the conduct of exchange rate management in India thatoccurred in the early 1990s had a significant impact on the monetary policy framework.Coincidentally, the 1990s were characterised by bouts of currency turmoil andcontagious financial crises in many parts of the world, developing, transitional anddeveloped alike.  Monetary policy became increasingly complex. For the majority ofdeveloping countries, including those in the Asian region, which continue to depend onexport performance, appropriate exchange rate determination is of great importanceas volatility imposes significant real effects in terms of fluctuations in employment andoutput and the distribution of activity between tradeables and non-tradeables,fluctuations that are difficult to absorb in such economies.  In the fiercely competitivetrading environment where countries seek to expand market shares aggressively byfiercely compressing margins, volatility in the exchange rate can easily translate exante profits into ex post losses along with the deleterious collateral impact onemployment and economic welfare. The determinants of exchange rate behaviourhowever, seem to have altered dramatically.  Earlier, factors related to changes inmerchandise trade flows and the behaviour of commodity price inflation were wellunderstood and provided guidance for operating monetary policy.  In this environment,monetary policy principally targeting low inflation was consistent with exchange ratechanges under purchasing power parity.  These traditional anchors of understandinghave been swept away by the vicissitudes of capital movements, with currencies oftenmoving far out of alignment of the traditional fundamentals.  Moreover, it now appearsthat expectations and even momentary reactions to the day’s news are often moreimportant in determining fluctuations in capital flows and hence it serves to amplifyexchange rates volatility.Furthermore, the liquidity impact of capital flows has become an even moreimportant problem for monetary management than it was the case hitherto. Theglobalisation of financial markets, even if imperfect, has now magnified the impact ofmonetary policy actions taken in one country on others. The policy accommodationpursued until recently by the US had a global impact, affecting the rest of the worldwith an abundance of liquidity.  Low interest rates in the US have encouraged capitalto flow into emerging market economies.  This has resulted in a large build-up offoreign exchange reserves and excessive domestic liquidity in many countries in Asia,amplifying the Fed’s policy stance. Complicating the environment of monetary andexchange rate management further, there is now increasing evidence that exchangerate pass-through to domestic inflation has tended to decline from the 1990s across anumber of countries. Inflation has turned out to be much less sensitive to exchangerates but has tended to equilibrate around the globe (Mohan, 2005).In India, the exchange rate regime up to 1990 is best described as anadjustable nominal peg to a basket of currencies of major trading partners with a band.After the balance of payment crisis of 1991 a two-step downward adjustment in theexchange rate was undertaken in July 1991 and then followed by a transitional 11-month period of dual exchange rates before a market-determined exchange ratesystem was set in place in March, 1993.  Since then, the exchange rate is largelydetermined by demand and supply conditions in the market.  The exchange rate policyin recent years has been guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring andmanagement of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a pre-announced target or a band, while allowing the underlying demand and supplyconditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way.Subject to this predominant objective, the exchange rate policy is guided by the needto reduce excess volatility, prevent the emergence of destabilising speculativeactivities, help maintain adequate level of reserves, and develop an orderly foreignexchange market. The Indian market, like other developing countries markets, is notyet very deep and broad, and can sometimes be characterised by uneven flow ofdemand and supply over different periods.  In this situation, the Reserve Bank of Indiahas been prepared to make sales and purchases of foreign currency in order to evenout lumpy demand and supply in the relatively thin forex market and to smoothen jerkymovements. However, such intervention is not governed by a predetermined target orband around the exchange rate. As the foreign exchange exposure of the Indianeconomy expands, the role of such uneven demands can be seen to reduce.  While itis not possible for any country to remain completely unaffected by developments in theinternational exchange markets, fortunately we were able to keep the spillover effectsof the Asian crisis to a minimum through constant monitoring and timely action,including recourse to strong monetary measures, when necessary, to prevent theemergence of self-fulfilling speculative activities (Mohan, 2005).The experience with capital flows has important lessons for the choice of theexchange rate regime.  The advocacy for corner solutions – a fixed peg withoutmonetary policy independence or a freely floating exchange rate retainingdiscretionary conduct of monetary policy – is distinctly on the decline.  The weight ofexperience seems to be tilting in favour of intermediate regimes with country-specificfeatures, without targets for the level of the exchange rate and exchange marketinterventions to fight extreme market turbulence. In general, emerging marketeconomies have accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves as a circuit breakerfor situations where unidirectional expectations become self-fulfilling.Recent information suggests that India’s integration with the world economy isgetting stronger, with implications for the conduct of exchange rate policies in thefuture.  Trade in goods (i.e., exports plus imports) as a proportion of GDP increasedfrom 14.6 per cent in 1990-91 to 28.9 per cent in 2004-05; while gross current accountreceipts and payments as percentage of GDP increased from 19.4 per cent to 45.0 percent over the same period, reflecting the growth in buoyant Indian trade in services.Correspondingly, in the capital account, gross flows (total inflows plus outflows) havedoubled as a proportion of GDP: from 12 per cent in 1990-91 to 24 per cent (US$ 167billion) in 2004-05.   Thus, the Indian economy is substantially exposed to theinternational economy and hence increasingly subject to the vicissitudes ofinternational financial developments. There is also growing evidence pointing to adistinct strengthening of India’s balance of payments, benefiting from the equilibratingproperties of a more flexible exchange rate regime.  Recent developments in thebalance of payments seem to indicate that the Indian economy is entering anexpansionary phase of the business cycle.  A noteworthy feature is the re-emergenceof a current account deficit (CAD) since 2004-05 after a hiatus of three years ofsurpluses, preceded by a decade of CADs averaging 1 per cent of GDP.  Oil imports,which account for about a quarter of total imports, have recorded high growth ratesand contributed 47 per cent to the change in the current account deficit in 2004-05over the previous year.  The elevated levels of international crude prices that rulecurrently have affected countries across the globe and India has been no exception.Apart from the impact of high crude oil price, the significant growth in merchandisetrade deficit in 2004-05 and 2005-06 was also caused by the sizeable growth in non-oilgoods imports, emanating from capital goods, export-related inputs and a range ofintermediate goods all of which have an intrinsic growth linked character.  Besides, thelarge expansion in imports is also spurring vigorous export growth.  In this sense, themerchandise trade deficit has acquired a growth leading dimension and is thus apositive feature of the Indian economy.As the current account deficit widens, and we contribute to the unwinding ofglobal imbalances at the margin, we have to give consideration to the sustainablemagnitude of the current account deficit. This sustainability depends on the perceivedstability of capital flows which, in turn, would be dependent on the assessment ofgrowth prospects of the economy by foreign lenders and investors. Whereas it isunderstood that a more open economy that has access to international capital flowscan run a higher current account deficit than a less open one, our approach to thisissue will remain informed by appropriate caution in the interest of financial stability.The acceleration in overall growth and the re-emergence of current account deficitsince 2004-05 has been accompanied by a greater degree of openness.  The growthin current payments has been accompanied by healthy growth in current receipts - inboth goods and services, thus providing for some confidence in the sustainability ofcurrent trade patterns and financial stability.  Current receipts pay for up to about 90per cent of current payments.Within current receipts, merchandise exports are being rapidly exceeded interms of growth rates by software earnings and a wide variety of business services.Besides, private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians workingabroad, seemed to have acquired a permanent character and have risen steadily toconstitute around 3 per cent of GDP in recent years, impervious to exchange ratemovements.  It needs to be mentioned that oil price increases typically result in higherremittances to India as well as non-resident deposit inflows in the capital account,producing non-linearity in the impact of international crude prices on the Indianeconomy. These factors strengthen the capability of the Indian economy to sustainhigher CADs than in the past.  Net capital flows have regularly exceeded the CADrequirements by a fair measure, enabling large accretions to the reserves.  In fact, theexpansion in the CAD during 2005-06 has masked the strength of the capital flows.With such an increase in exposure to the international economy, trade andother current account flows, along with capital flows, the Indian economy is enteringuncharted territory, although a healthy one from all accounts.   We have found that ourapproach of broad market determination of the exchange rate, flexibility, combinedwith intervention as felt necessary, has served as well so far.   As we proceed we feelconfident that we continue in a similar direction in the future, while constantlymonitoring the situation to make any changes that may become desirable.IV. Dealing with ChangeRecent developments have posed testing challenges to the conduct ofmonetary and exchange rate management in India as in the rest of the world.  Whileworld GDP growth is well above its long-run average of 3.8 per cent, there is a growingincidence of large systemic shocks. Though price stability has been maintained in theface of the oil shock, risks loom large in the form of lagged second order effects of oilprice increases, geopolitical tensions, the probability of disorderly and rapidadjustment of current account imbalances and the risks emanating from the housingmarket, particularly when the cycle turns down. The outlook for the oil economy in thenear term appears to be tilting in favour of higher prices and greater volatility. Globalimbalances widened further during 2005 in an environment of rising interest ratesworldwide and ample liquidity in global financial markets. The current account deficit ofthe US surpassed US $800 billion, matched by increased surpluses elsewhere,particularly in Europe, East Asia and oil-exporting countries. While the deficit is stillincreasing, the location of the surplus appears to be changing recently. The currentaccount surpluses of the oil-exporting countries of the Middle East are close to thoseof emerging Asia. Less than a third of the combined current account surplus of the oil-exporting countries has been reflected in their foreign exchange reserves, which rose,by about US $ 90 billion in 2005. There are some indications that the oil surpluseshave been deployed in more diversified avenues through new investment agenciesand oil stabilisation funds which could be invested in assets other than bank deposits.In an environment of above trend growth in the world economy, unusually low volatilityin financial markets and strong profitability in banking systems in most countries,investors have been prepared to purchase risky assets at relatively high prices in2005. Monitoring where the risk lies has become very difficult for the regulators, due toemergence of large conglomerates, sophisticated market instruments such asderivatives and presence of players like hedge funds. In this environment, any volatileand unpredictable changes in asset prices could become a source of financialinstability. To maintain confidence in the financial system, it is necessary to preventshocks from spreading through contagion.Private capital inflows to emerging market economies increased in 2005;market access continued to be favourable and external financing costs droppedsharply. There have been low levels of credit spreads on bonds issued by emergingmarkets and companies with low credit ratings, which are around their lowest levelssince 1997. Partly in response to these very positive borrowing conditions, anincreasing number of emerging market countries have been able to issue long-termdebt in their own currency and thereby reduce foreign currency exposure and rolloverrisk. Of the major central banks, the US Federal Reserve has raised its policy rate by25 basis points each on sixteen occasions from 1.0 per cent in June 2004 to 5.0 percent by May 2006. The ECB and Bank of England are hinting at policy rate increasesin the coming months.Under these conditions, certain stylised aspects of exchange market behaviourneed to be kept in mind while dealing with monetary and exchange rate managementfrom a medium term perspective. First, the day-to-day exchange rate movements inthe short-run in foreign exchange markets have little to do with the so-called‘fundamentals’ or a country’s capacity to meet its payments obligations, including debtservice. Second, in view of inter-bank activity, which sets the pace in forex markets,transaction volumes in “gross” terms are several times higher, and more variable, than“net” flows. Third, developing countries generally have smaller and localised forexmarkets where nominal domestic currency values were generally expected to show adepreciating trend, particularly if relative inflation rates were higher than those of majorindustrial countries. In this situation, there is a greater tendency among marketparticipants to hold long positions in foreign currencies and to hold back sales whenexpectations are adverse and currencies are depreciating, than the other way roundwhen currencies are appreciating and expectations are favourable. In recent years,exchange rate trends have been more mixed despite the existence of inflationdifferentials.  Consequently, we are also seeing change in such behavioural trends.Fourth, the tendency of importers/exporters and other end-users to look at exchangerate movements as a source of return without adopting appropriate risk managementstrategies, at times, creates uneven supply-demand conditions, often based on “newsand views”.  A self-sustaining triangle of supply demand mismatch, increased inter-bank activity to take advantage of it and accentuated volatility triggered by negativesentiments, not in tune with fundamentals can be set in motion, requiring quickintervention/response by authorities.Against this back ground, India’s exchange rate policy of focusing on managingvolatility with no fixed rate target while allowing the underlying demand and supplyconditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly wayhas stood the test of time. Despite several unexpected external and domesticdevelopments, India’s external situation continues to remain satisfactory. Ourexperience has also highlighted the importance of building up foreign exchangereserves to take care of unforeseen contingencies, volatile capital flows and otherdevelopments, which can affect expectations adversely as the emerging economieshave to rely largely on their own resources during external exigencies (or contagion)as there is no international “lender of last resort” to provide additional liquidity at shortnotice on acceptable terms. Thus, the need for adequate reserves is unlikely to beeliminated or reduced even if exchange rates are allowed to float freely.The overall approach to the management of India’s foreign exchange reservesin recent years has reflected the changing composition of balance of payments, andhas endeavoured to reflect the “liquidity risks” associated with different types of flowsand other requirements. The policy for reserve management is thus judiciously builtupon a host of identifiable factors and other contingencies. Such factors, inter alia,include: the size of the current account deficit; the size of short-term liabilities(including current repayment obligations on long-term loans); the possible variability inportfolio investments and other types of capital flows; the unanticipated pressures onthe balance of payments arising out of external shocks and movements in therepatriable foreign currency deposits of non-resident Indians. Taking these factors intoaccount, India’s foreign exchange reserves are at present comfortable, althoughpursuing this policy on a long-term basis raised the issue of sustainability of suchstrategy especially under the backdrop of uninterrupted inflows of foreign capital,optimum sterilization of such flows, appropriate instrument and cost of pursuingsterilization and associated liquidity management. In fact, the conduct of monetarypolicy and management in the context of large and volatile capital flows has proved tobe difficult for many countries.A key issue facing India admidst these sweeping winds of change is to workout the policy mix of instruments for liquidity management consistent with the monetarypolicy framework and operating procedures. In this context, the Indian experience withsterilisation and liquidity management is somewhat unique as compared with theapproach followed by some other central banks in Asia. For instance, central banks inIndonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand all sterilised inflows indifferent ways. The Bank Indonesia (BI) employed Open Market Operations (OMOs)by issuing its own paper and also managed its budgetary operations in a way that builtup large deposits with the bank Indonesia. While the Bank of Thailand (BOT)conducted OMOs to sterilize inflows, central bank bills were used extensively by theBank of Korea (BoK) which later used quantitative controls and discounting policies todampen domestic credit. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) historically deployedgovernment and other deposits with the central bank to impact monetary liquidity. Onthe other hand, China sterilised capital inflows through issuance of central bank billsapart from using other instruments like reserve requirements, differentiating prudentialtreatment of banks based on capital strength, etc.In the Indian context, sharp shifts in capital flows and hence in liquidity havemarked the period during 2001-06 and can be explained as partly frictional and arisingfrom seasonal and transient factors and partly cyclical, associated with the pick up ingrowth momentum and the induced demand for bank credit. This has warrantedappropriate monetary operations to obviate wide fluctuations in market rates andensure reasonable stability consistent with the monetary policy stance.  In fact, theIndian experience illustrates the tight link between external sector management anddomestic monetary management.  What may be small movements in capital flows forthe rest of the world can translate into large domestic liquidity movements distortingmarket exchange and interest rates in a developing country.  Moreover, the absorptionof external savings is also dependent on the stage of a business cycle that a countrymay be going through.  In our case, the early years of this decade were characterisedby low industrial growth and hence the absorptive capacity of the country wasconstrained.  As we have entered an expansionary phase the current account haswidened and the potential for greater absorption has manifested itself.   Just as foreignexchange reserves can act as a shock absorber, on the external front, we had to lookfor a parallel liquidity shock absorber for domestic monetary management.In this context, a new instrument, named as the Market Stabilisation Scheme(MSS) has evolved as a useful instrument of monetary policy to sustain open marketoperations. The MSS was made operational from April 2004. Under this scheme,which is meant exclusively for liquidity management, the Reserve Bank has beenempowered to issue Government Treasury Bills and medium duration dated securitiesfor the purpose of liquidity absorption. The scheme works by impounding the proceedsof auctions of Treasury bill and Government securities in a separate identifiable MSScash account maintained and operated by the RBI. The amounts credited into theMSS cash Account are appropriated only for the purpose of redemption and / or buyback of the Treasury Bills and / or dated securities issued under the MSS. MSSsecurities are indistinguishable from normal Treasury Bills and Government datedsecurities in the hands of the lender.  The payments for interest and discount on MSSsecurities are not made from the MSS Account, but shown in the Union budget andother related documents transparently as distinct components under separate sub-heads. The introduction of MSS has succeeded, in principle, in restoring LAF to itsintended function of daily liquidity management.   Since its introduction in April 2004,the MSS has served as a very useful instrument for medium term monetary andliquidity management.  It has been unwound in times of low capital flows and greaterliquidity needs and built up when excess capital flows could lead to excess domesticliquidity.Going forward, there will be a continuous need to adapt the strategy of liquiditymanagement as well as exchange rate management for effective monetarymanagement and short-term interest rate smoothening. This issue becomes evenmore relevant under a freer regime of capital flows.  Global developments areexpected to have an increasing role in determining the conduct of monetary andexchange rate policies in our countries.  In an environment of global convergence,retaining independence of monetary policy may become increasingly difficult, callingfor hard choices in terms of goals and instruments.V. Financial Integration in Asia: Some IssuesIn an era of increasing globalisation, discussion on monetary policy andexchange rate frameworks cannot be done in isolation. It is, therefore, pertinent toplace the Indian experience in the context of Asian economic co-operation. Recentyears have witnessed an expansion of the channels of integration within the Asianregion, built primarily on strong macroeconomic performance.  Asia accounts for morethan 30 per cent of world GDP and contributes half of global growth. While the AsianDevelopment Bank placed the aggregate GDP growth for the region at 7.3 per cent in2004, the IMF in its World Economic Outlook, projected growth for emerging Asianeconomies at 7.3 per cent for the year 2005 too. Inflationary pressures wereexperienced in some of the Asian countries during 2004 and 2005, but were moderatein the context of high growth and oil prices. GDP growth in emerging Asia is driven byrobust export growth as well as strong domestic demand. Sustained rapid growth inrecent years and rising living standards have been accompanied by a dramaticincrease in Asia's shares in world exports and raw material consumption. Clearly,globalization has had a major impact on Asia’s role in the world economy as there isan ongoing transformation in the composition of production and trade with risingcomparative advantage globally. In particular, economies with relatively high wagecosts are shifting toward higher value-added products, including services, within theregion. Furthermore, financial flows within the region have become more significant,intermediating savings within Asia, as well as channelling them to other parts of theworld. The emerging markets of Asia, with their dynamic and skilled work force, arewell placed to take advantage of new technologies and seize opportunities in theinternational market place to become a major engine of growth in the global economy.Strong economic performance has been accompanied by an accumulation of foreignexchange reserves to build up resilience against external shocks (Reserve Bank ofIndia, 2006).As the Asian region has developed, intra Asian trade has gathered momentumleading to even higher economic integration within the region.   This has been aided bythe existence of ASEAN, which has progressively led to lowering of trade barriersamong its member countries.   As the ASEAN region has developed and gained inconfidence trade links with the more developed countries of Japan, China and Koreahave also intensified, along with more structured discussions towards the formation ofPTAs and FTAs within the region.   While this trade integration has intensified overtime progress on financial integration has been limited.  Understandably, there is nowincreasing discussion on the nature and prospects of progressive financial integrationcommensurate with degree of economic integration observed in the region.Although financial integration in Asia is possibly lagging trade integration, theinitiatives taken on this front are getting stronger. Central bank cooperation in Asiathrough a network of swaps was formalised in Chiang Mai Agreement of 2000 amongcentral banks in East Asia. Among others, this led to two parallel movements – one inSouth Asia in the form of the SAARC Initiative and the other in East Asia reflecting theASEAN+3 Initiative. The idea of having an integrated financial system so as to provideviable ‘safety net’ in times of crisis germinated quite strongly.  More recently, there hasbeen some discussion on the adoption of an Asian Currency Unit to avoid the volatilityin intra-Asian currency movements and to create one of the principal currencies of theworld. In this context, it is important to revisit first principles.India's engagement with South East and East Asia is also on the upswing.  Theshare of exports to developing Asia in India’s total exports more than doubled fromabout 14 per cent in 1990-91 to almost 30 per cent in 2005-06. The correspondingshare of the region in India’s imports also increased from 14 per cent to 21 per centduring this period. In recent years, China has emerged as a major trading partner forIndia, accounting for 6.0 per cent of total exports and 7.4 per cent of total imports in2005-06.  In recognition of this expansion of economic engagement with the rest ofAsia, as Governor Y.V. Reddy had announced at the First IMF-MAS Seminar heldhere last year, we have already implemented computation of the new six country realeffective exchange rate (REER) index. This new index introduces two new currencies,the Remnimbi and the Hong Kong Dollar to supplement the earlier currency basketthat includes the US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro, and the Japanese Yen (Reddy,2005).In the post-Asian crisis period, several Asian economies have adopted differenttypes of intermediate exchange rate regimes with a growing preference for relativelymore flexible exchange rates than before. In this respect, the key issue is how much ofsuch flexibility is envisaged as optimal? What are the instruments to manageexchange rates? It is also necessary in this regard to recognize and re-assess theoptimal level of ‘insurance’ that is provided by the foreign exchange reserves that isneeded against potentially volatile and disruptive capital flows. Finally, recent sharpupward movements in oil prices in an era of heightened uncertainty may evokedifferential responses on account of country-specific factors.  It is in this milieu that thepragmatic choice of instrument of integration in the region has been regional tradeagreements, best viewed as an expression of enlightened self-interest. The movetowards regionalism has been catalyzed by the growing consensus that theenhancement of public good requires coordinated action and belief in overlappingfortunes. India has also entered into various regional economic cooperation,free/preferential trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties with its Asianneighbours.Drawing from the experience and lessons of other regional blocks, it isimportant to take cognizance of certain issues for successful functioning of cooperativemonetary arrangements as envisaged under any common currency unit. While a singlecurrency has worked well in the context of the trading bloc centered on the USA,lessons can also be drawn from the recent experience of monetary and economicintegration in Europe. The history of European monetary integration dated back withthe creation of trading bloc - European Economic Community (EEC) - in 1958, whichtook the shape of the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1979 with a fluctuatingexchange rate band among member countries. Currently, there are 12 countries thatcomprise a common Euro area (monetary union), although 25 countries constitute themember states of the European Union (EU). Some of the EU member countries areactively trying to be the part of the Euro area by fulfilling the four broad convergencecriteria stipulated. The objective of monetary union in the euro area was clearlydefined in the Maastricht Treaty and the primary objective of the European CentralBank (ECB) is to maintain price stability in the euro area. Price stability was thendefined by the European Central Bank as an inflation rate of below but close to 2 percent over the medium-term. The integration was largely facilitated by an institutionalframework that had evolved over more than forty years.It may be useful to note that in the United States, which may itself be seen as alarge currency area, a single currency works because of the existence of labourmobility across regions and wage and price flexibility, within and across regions, i.e.,due to real factors which determine the real effective exchange rate (REER) and long-run competitiveness. On the other hand, in Europe, introduction of a single currencymet with some resistance due to language and cultural differences that historically limitlabour mobility and wage flexibility. Labor unions are more powerful in Europe than inthe United States, making real wages sticky. Moreover, with product marketcompetition less intense, European producers are more likely to pass wage costs toconsumers in the form of higher prices. Reflecting these factors, unemployment in theEuropean countries appears to be more persistent in nature than in the US. Suffice itto conclude that the jury is still out on the merits of a common currency as it doesreduce the flexibility of an economy to adjust to real sector changes (as is being seenin Europe). This in turn, can cause differential effective overvaluation/undervaluation ofthe currency across different countries within a currency union and possible erosion oflong-term competitiveness of affected countries.Relative to the Euro area, the Asian region exhibits much more pronounceddiversity in economic structure, stages of development, demographic features, socialand political systems and even lower mobility of factors of production, particularlylabour. The successful operation of any currency area is dependent on wage flexibilityand labour mobility across regions. With the existence of a common external exchangerate, effective internal flexibility in the "exchange rate" for a particular region can beachieved by the lower or higher wages, as necessary, relative to the rest of thecurrency area.   Equilibration is then achieved through labour mobility that responds tothese inter-regional wage differences.   Furthermore, as has been found in Europe,through the imposition of the Maastricht criteria, commonality in fiscal conditionsacross countries is desirable for effective area-wide monetary policy.  Any movementtowards greater monetary and exchange rate cooperation among Asian countries willneed to pay explicit attention to this set of difficult issues.Meanwhile, there is no doubt that greater financial cooperation that leads togreater trade facilitation and fosters greater capital market linkages among Asiancountries would be a move in the right direction.   As there is greater variation amongAsian countries with regard to the existence of current account surpluses and deficits,greater capital market linkage through the development of bond markets, trading andsettlement systems and the like, will enable surplus countries to invest in the deficitcountries within the region.   Thus Asian savings would have the potential of being putto use for fostering growth within the region.VI. ConclusionCooperation among central banks around Asia is likely to play a key role innurturing a broad – based mandate for integration.  This has been in evidence as ithelps in exchanging views and information on various subjects of common interests.Central bank cooperation helped in resolving the Mexican crisis of 1994.  The mostrecent and ultimate form of central bank cooperation was achieved in 1998 when theEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was created as the sole authority over monetary policyamong its 11 members and with the creation of a new common currency in January1999. On the other hand, according to some experts, central bank cooperation leadsto moral hazard and, therefore, tampering with otherwise efficient market determinedexchange rates, trade flows and general function of the market forces.Nevertheless, in the context of our region, central bank cooperation isindispensable. In fact, with improvements in transportation and communication, somecommonality in world view on the operations of the economy, and enhancedinstitutional arrangements, central bank cooperation has grown extensively. Theincreased degree of global integration and liberalization of capital movements wouldserve to be a dominant factor in encouraging cooperation amongst central banks inour region. Furthermore, a major implication of growing financial and trade integration,globally as well as within the region, is the greater susceptibility of monetary policy andexchange rate management to global factors relative to domestic factors, necessitatingincreased co-ordination in macro-economic management. The perceived benefits andcosts of economic integration of a country within a larger region have to be seen in thecontext of the economy's resilience to possible shocks in an open economyframework.  The ability of a country to derive benefits from economic cooperation inthe presence of volatility in international capital flows is ultimately contingent upon thequality of its macroeconomic framework and institutions.ReferencesAhluwalia, Montek Singh, Y.
