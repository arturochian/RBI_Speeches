Reforming India’s Financial Sector:????Changing Dimensions and Emerging IssuesProf. Wyplosz, Mr. Roth and Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,I am honoured and indeed privileged to be amidst such an eminentgathering of central bankers and policymakers at the International Centre forMonetary and Banking Studies. In particular, I am grateful to Mr. Roth, Chairman,Swiss National Bank and Mr. Hildebrand for providing me this forum. Thepresentation today is on reforming India's financial sector. I eagerly look forward tothe benefit of productive discussions in this august gathering. In the address today,I will present a detailed account of the broad lines on which reforms in financialsector have progressed and then will narrate the distinguishing features of thereforms in India. Further, a broad assessment of the impact of reforms will precedea description of the work in progress.II. Progress of ReformsIndia embarked on a strategy of economic reforms in the wake of a balance-of-payments crisis in 1991; a central plank of the reforms was reforms in thefinancial sector, and with banks being the mainstay of financial intermediation, thebanking sector. At the same time, reforms were also undertaken in varioussegments of financial markets, to enable the banking sector to perform itsintermediation role in an efficient manner. The thrust of these reforms was topromote a diversified, efficient and competitive financial system, with the ultimateobjective of improving the allocative efficiency of resources, through operationalflexibility, improved financial viability and institutional strengthening. The reformmeasures in the financial sector can be envisaged as having progressed along thefollowing lines.First, the reforms included creating a conducive policy environment – thesewere related to lowering of the erstwhile high levels of statutory pre-emption in theform of reserve requirements, gradual rationalisation of the administered interestrate structure to make it market-determined and streamlining the allocation of creditto certain sectors.                                                ? Address delivered by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, RBI at the International Centre forMonetary and Banking Studies, Geneva on May 9, 2006. He is thankful to Mr. SaibalGhosh for valuable comments and assistance.Second, the efficiency and productivity of the system has been improved byenhancing competition. Since the onset of reforms, clear and transparentguidelines were laid down for establishment of new private banks and foreignbanks were allowed more liberal entry. A precondition for new banks was that thebank had to be fully computerised ab initio. This was done in order to infusetechnological efficiency and productivity in the sector and also to serve as ademonstration effect on existing banks. As many as ten new private banks areoperating in India at present; foreign banks operating in India numbered over 30 atend-September 2005. Competition was encouraged among public sector banksalso.Third, the ownership base in domestic banks has been broad-based. Theequity base of most public sector banks was expanded by infusing private equity,though the government continued to retain majority shareholding. At present, publicsector banks with hundred per cent government ownership comprise around 10 percent of commercial bank assets compared to around 90 per cent at the beginningof reforms. The share of listed private banks – both old and new – in total assets ofprivate banks, stood at over 90 per cent at end-March 2005.Fourth, a set of micro-prudential measures were instituted, to impart greaterstrength to the banking system and also to ensure their safety and soundness withthe objective of benchmarking against international best practices (risk-basedcapital standards, income recognition, asset classification and provisioningrequirements for non-performing loans as well as provisioning for ‘standard’ loans,exposure limits for single and group borrowers, accounting rules, investmentvaluation norms). These norms have been tightened over the years in order togradually converge towards international best practices.Fifth, the process of regulation and supervision has also been strengthened.A strategy of on-site inspection and off-site surveillance mechanism together withgreater accountability of external audit has been instituted. This has beencomplemented with a process of prompt corrective action mechanism.Sixth, in tandem with the improvements in prudential practices, institutionalarrangement to improve supervision and to ensure integrity of payment andsettlement systems has been put in place. As early as in 1994, a Board forFinancial Supervision (BFS) was constituted comprising select members of RBIBoard to pay undivided attention to supervision. The BFS ensures an integratedapproach to supervision of banks, non-banking finance companies, urbancooperative banks, select development banks and primary dealers. As part of theprocess of ensuring a coordinated approach to supervision, a High Level Co-ordination Committee on Financial and Capital Markets (HLCCFCM) wasconstituted in 1999 with the Governor, RBI as Chairman, and the Chiefs of thesecurities market and insurance regulators, and the Secretary of the FinanceMinistry as the members to iron out regulatory gaps and overlaps. To minimisesettlement risks in the money, government securities and forex markets, theClearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) was established in 2002. Acting as acentral counterparty through novation, the CCIL provides guaranteed settlement,thereby limiting the problem of gridlock of settlements. A Board for Regulation andSupervision of Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS) has also been recentlyconstituted to prescribe policies relating to oversight of the financial infrastructurerelating to payment and settlement systems. Finally, to address the systemic risksarising from growth of financial conglomerates, the RBI has put in place anoversight framework which envisages periodic sharing of information among theconcerned regulatory bodies.Seventh, the legal environment for conducting banking business has alsobeen strengthened. Debt recovery tribunals were introduced early into the reformsprocess exclusively for adjudication of delinquent loans in respect of banks. Morerecently, an Act to enforce securities and recover loans was enacted in 2003 toenhance protection of lenders rights. To combat the menace of crime-relatedmoney, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act was enacted in 2003 to providethe enabling legal framework. The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act,2004 has recently been enacted by the Parliament which is expected to enhancethe quality of credit decision making. The Government is considering several majorlegal amendments to enhance the powers of the RBI. Major changes relate toremoval of the restrictions on voting rights in banks, providing legal basis forconsolidated supervision, removal of the floor of 25 per cent in respect of statutoryliquidity ratio and empowering the RBI to supercede the board of a bankingcompany.Eighth, the reforms have focused on adopting appropriate processes in orderto ensure development of various segments of the markets. In the banking sector,the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has emerged as an important self-regulatorybody working for the growth of a healthy and forward-looking banking and financialservices industry. In the debt market segment, the RBI interacts closely with FixedIncome Money Market Dealers Association of India (FIMMDA) and the PrimaryDealers Association of India (PDAI) for overall improvement of government debtmarkets and promoting sound market practices. With regard to the paymentssystem infrastructure, the introduction of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)system since 2004 has made it possible for large value payments to be transactedin a faster, efficient and secure manner. In order to enhance transparency ofsecondary market trades in government securities, a screen based anonymousorder matching system has been operationalised.Ninth, the banking system has also witnessed greater levels of transparencyand standards of disclosure with greater volume of information being disclosed asNotes on Accounts in their balance sheets. Salient among these include majorprofitability and financial ratios, details of capital structures, as well as movementsin non-performing loans, movements in provisions, advances to sensitive sectors,to mention a few. The range of disclosures has gradually been expanded over theyears to promote market discipline.Tenth, corporate governance in banks has improved substantially over theyears. A Consultative Group was constituted to explore the issue in all its facets inaccordance with best extant practices. Based on its recommendations, in June2002, banks were advised to adopt and implement appropriate governancepractices. As part of its efforts to promote sound corporate governance, the RBI hasbeen focusing on ensuring 'fit and proper' owners and directors of the bank andlaying stress on diversified ownership. Banks have been advised to ensure that anomination committee screens the nominated and elected directors to satisfy the 'fitand proper' criteria.III. Features of ReformsThe unique features of the progress in financial sector reforms may be ofsome interest to this audience. First, financial sector reforms were undertaken earlyin the reform cycle. Second, the reforms process was not driven by any bankingcrisis, nor was it the outcome of any external support package. Third, the design ofthe reforms was crafted through domestic expertise, taking on board theinternational experiences in this respect. Fourth, the reforms were carefullysequenced in respect to instruments and objectives. Thus, prudential norms andsupervisory strengthening were introduced early in the reform cycle, followed byinterest rate deregulation and gradually lowering of statutory pre-emptions. Themore complex aspects of legal and accounting measures were ushered insubsequently when the basic tenets of the reforms were already in place.A unique feature of the reform of public sector banks, which dominated theIndian banking sector, was the process of financial restructuring. Banks wererecapitalised by the government to meet prudential norms through recapitalisationbonds. The mechanism of hiving off bad loans to a separate government assetmanagement company was not considered appropriate in view of the moral hazard.The subsequent divestment of equity and offer to private shareholders wasundertaken through a public offer and not by sale to strategic investors.Consequently, all the public sector banks, which issued shares to privateshareholders, have been listed on the exchanges and are subject to the samedisclosure and market discipline standards as other listed entities. To address theproblem of distressed assets, a mechanism has been developed to allow sale ofthese assets to Asset Reconstruction Companies which are in the private sectorand operate as independent commercial entities.In terms of the processes also, certain interesting features of the reforms arein evidence. The first has been its gradualism, wherein reforms were undertakenonly after a process of close and continuous consultation with all stakeholders. Thisparticipative process with wider involvement not only encouraged a more informedevaluation of underlying content of policies but also enhanced the credibility ofpolicies and generated expectations among economic agents about the processbeing enduring in nature. The second has been a constant rebalancing of reformpriorities predicated upon the domestic and global business environment, institutionof prudential practices, upgradation of the regulatory and supervisory framework,institution of appropriate institutional and legal reforms and the state of openness ofthe economy. The third important feature of the reforms has been its harmonisationwith other policies dictated, among others, by the state of preparedness of thefinancial sector and above all, the underlying macroeconomic environment. Fourth,the reforms have progressed with emphasis on the common person with the aim ofdeveloping a system that is responsive to the needs of all sections of society.IV. Assessment of ImpactHow useful has been the financial liberalisation process in India towardsimproving the functioning of markets and institutions? First, with the development ofappropriate market regulation and associated payment and settlement systems andthe greater integration into global markets, the financial markets have witnessedrapid growth and robustness. A range of instruments in domestic and foreigncurrency are traded in financial markets.  In addition, the market in corporate bondshas been spurred with increased use of external credit ratings. Further, derivativeproducts covering forwards, swaps and options as also structured products aretransacted enabling corporates and banks to manage their risk exposures. Themarket in securitised paper both mortgage backed and asset backed securities hasalso grown significantly supported by a well developed credit rating industry.Second, liberalisation in financial sector has led to emergence of financialconglomerates since banks have diversified their activities into insurance, assetmanagement securities business, etc. Third, prudential regulation and supervisionhas improved; the combination of regulation, supervision and a better safety nethas limited the impact of unforeseen shocks on the financial system. In addition, therole of market forces in enabling price discovery has enhanced. The dismantling ofthe erstwhile administered interest rate structure has permitted financialintermediaries to pursue lending and deposit taking based on commercialconsiderations and their asset-liability profiles. The financial liberalisation processhas also enabled reduction in the overhang of non-performing loans: this entailedboth a ‘stock’ (restoration of net worth) solution as well as a ‘flow’ (improving futureprofitability) solution. The former was achieved through a carefully crafted capitalinfusion from the fisc, which aggregated, on a cumulative basis, to about one percent of GDP; the flow solution, on the other hand, necessitated changes in theinstitutional and legal processes which were implemented over a period of time.Moreover, financial entities have become increasingly conscious about riskmanagement practices and have instituted risk management models based on theirproduct profiles, business philosophy and customer orientation. Additionally, accessto credit has improved, through newly established domestic banks, foreign banksand bank-like intermediaries. Moreover, government debt markets have developed,enabling RBI to undertake monetary policy more effectively, providing options tobanks for liquidity management and allowing less inflationary finance of fiscaldeficits. The growth of government debt markets has also provided a benchmark forprivate debt markets to develop.There have also been significant improvements in the informationinfrastructure. The accounting and auditing of intermediaries has strengthened.Availability of information on borrowers has improved which will help reduceinformation asymmetry among financial entities. The technological infrastructurehas developed in tandem with modern-day requirements in information technologyand communications networking. Moreover, the concept of finance has permeatedacross various institutions and a 'finance view' of all market transactions hasemerged. Finally, the quality of human capital involved in the financial sector hastypically been of the highest genre, facilitating non-disruptive progress of thereforms process.The improvements in the performance of the financial system over thedecade-and-a-half of reforms are also reflected in the improvement in a number ofindicators. Capital adequacy of the banking sector recorded a marked improvementand stood at 12.8 per cent at end-March 2005, comparable to 13.0 per cent for theUS during the same period. Typically, the capital adequacy position of developedcountries has remained range-bound within 10-14 per cent and judged from thatstandpoint, our capital position compares favourably with those numbers.On the asset quality front, notwithstanding the gradual tightening ofprudential norms, non-performing loans (NPL) to total loans of commercial bankswhich was at a high of 15.7 per cent at end-March 1997 declined to 5.2 per cent atend-March 2005. These figures are broadly comparable to those prevailing inseveral leading European economies (like Italy, Germany and France) whichtypically ranged within 4-7 per cent of total loans and lower than those in mostAsian economies, although they were higher than those prevailing in countries suchas, the US, Canada and Australia. Net NPLs also witnessed a significant declineand stood at 2.0 per cent of net advances at end-March 2005, driven by theimprovements in loan loss provisioning, which comprises over half of the totalprovisions and contingencies.Operating expenses of banks in India are also much more aligned to thoseprevailing internationally, hovering around 2.21 per cent during 2003-04 (2.16 percent during 2004-05). In developed countries, in 2004, banks' operating expenseswere 3.5 per cent in the US and 2.8 per cent in Canada and Italy and 2.6 per centin Australia, while they were in the range of 1.1 to 2.0 per cent in banks of otherdeveloped countries such as Japan, Switzerland, Germany and the UK. Bankprofitability levels in India as indicated by return on assets have also shown anupward trend and for most banks has been a little more than one per cent.Incidentally, the turnaround in the financial performance of public sectorbanks has resulted in the market valuation of government holdings far exceedingthe recapitalisation cost. The Indian experience has shown that a strong regulatoryframework which is non-discriminatory, market discipline through listing on stockexchanges and operational autonomy has had positive impact on the functioning ofthe public sector banks.V. Work in ProgressFinancial sector reform is a continuous process that needs to be in tune withthe emerging macroeconomic realities and the state of maturity of institutions andmarkets, mindful of financial stability. In this changing milieu, there are severalareas which are being addressed now.The first issue pertains to capital account convertibility. In view of the rapidchanges that have taken place over the last few years and the growing integrationof the Indian economy with the world economy, the RBI has recently set up aCommittee comprising eminent policymakers, financial sector experts andacademia to suggest a roadmap for fuller capital account convertibility. TheCommittee is required to, in this context, examine the implications of fuller capitalaccount convertibility on monetary and exchange rate management, financialmarkets and financial system.The second issue relates to the fiscal area. The institution of the rule-basedfiscal policy, as envisaged in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget ManagementAct, 2003 (FRBM) has been on revenue-led fiscal consolidation, better expenditureoutcomes and rationalisation of tax regimes to remove distortions and improvecompetitiveness of domestic goods and services in a globalised economicenvironment. In this context, the RBI has refrained from participating in the primaryissues, except in exceptional circumstances. These de facto arrangements, whichhave been working satisfactorily for some period, have come into effect throughlegislative sanction effective April 1, 2006. While Central Government restated itscommitment to fiscal consolidation as per FRBM Act, several state governmentshave enacted legislation on similar lines while some others are in the pipeline.An important issue, specifically relating to the banking sector, isconsolidation. Despite the liberalisation process, the structure of the Indian bankingsystem has continued without much change though development financeinstitutions were merged with banks. The consolidation process within the bankingsystem in recent years has primarily been confined to a few mergers in the privatesector segment induced by financial position of the banks. Some mergers may takeplace in future for compliance with minimum net worth requirement or norms ondiversified ownership. The RBI has created an enabling environment by layingdown guidelines on mergers and acquisitions. As the bottom lines of domesticbanks come under increasing pressure and the options for organic growth exhaustthemselves, banks will be exploring ways for inorganic expansion.The fourth aspect is the role of foreign banks. In terms of assets, the shareof foreign banks has roughly been around a quarter within the non public sectorbanking category. They are dominant in certain segments, such as, the forexmarket and the derivatives market, accounting for over half of the off-balance sheetexposure of commercial banks. The RBI had, in February 2005, laid down clear andtransparent guidelines which provide a roadmap for expansion of foreign banks. Asit stands at present, foreign ownership in domestic banks is quite significant. Inseveral new private banks, this share is well over 50 per cent; these banks accountfor around half of the total assets of domestic private banks. Even in several publicsector banks, the extent of foreign ownership within the private holding is close tothat of the domestic private holding.The fifth issue pertains to Basel II. Commercial banks in India are expectedto start implementing Basel II with effect from March 31, 2007 though a marginalstretching is not ruled out in view of the state of preparedness. They will initiallyadopt Standardised Approach for credit risk and Basic Indicator Approach foroperational risk. After adequate skills are developed, both at the banks and also atsupervisory levels, some banks may be allowed to migrate to the Internal RatingBased (IRB) Approach. Under Basel II, Indian banks will require larger capitalmainly due to capital required for operational risk. The RBI has introduced capitalinstruments both in Tier I and Tier II available in other jurisdictions. In addition, theRBI is involved in capacity building for ensuring the regulator’s ability for identifyingand permitting eligible banks to adopt IRB / Advanced Measurement approaches.The sixth aspect is the role of capital in case of regional rural banks (RRBs)and cooperative banks, which provide banking services primarily in the rural andsemi-urban areas. The problems with regard to this segment have been widelydocumented: these include constraints on timely credit availability, its high cost,neglect of small farmers and continued presence of informal lenders. It is arguedthat most part of the cooperative credit structure is multi-layered, undercapitalised,over-staffed and under-skilled, often with high level of delinquent loans. The RRBsalso appear to share these problems, although there are several viable institutionsin this category. These are being addressed on a priority basis. A national-levelcommittee had recently made recommendations to revive and restructure the ruralcooperative credit structure. These have been accepted by the government whichhas set up a National Level Implementation and Monitoring Committee under theChairmanship of the Governor for overall guidance in implementation. A process ofrevitalising RRBs and urban cooperative banks in a medium-term framework is alsounderway.Seventh, we are adopting a three-track approach with regard to capitaladequacy rules. On the first track, the commercial banks are required to maintaincapital for both credit and market risks as per Basel I framework; cooperative bankson the second track are required to maintain capital for credit risk as per Basel Iframework and surrogates for market risk; RRBs on the third track which thoughsubject to prudential norms do not have capital requirement on par with the Basel Iframework. In other words, a major segment of systemic importance is under a fullBasel I framework, a portion of the minor segment partly on Basel I framework anda smaller segment on a non-Basel framework. Even after commercial banks beginimplementing Basel II framework in March 2007, we may witness Basel I and non-Basel II entities operating simultaneously. This would not only ensure greateroutreach of banking business, but also, in the present scenario of high growth,enable them to usefully lend to the disadvantageous sections and successfullypierce the informal credit segment.The eighth issue of relevance is that of financial inclusion. While resourcelimitations experienced by low-income households will continue to constrain theiraccess and use of financial products, the challenge remains for developingappropriate policies, procedures and products that can overcome this difficultywithin the bounds of resource constraints. Apart from greater latitude in the range ofidentity documents that are acceptable to open an account, there is also a need forindependent information and advisory service. This needs to be supplemented bynurturing appropriate public-private partnerships. Some development to this effectis already evidenced in the significant growth and development of micro-financeactivities. Self-help groups formed by non-government organisations and financedby banks represents an important constituent of this development process in India.As part of its ongoing efforts to encourage greater financial inclusion, theAnnual Policy Statement released in April 2006, gives particular attention to issuesrelating to farmers. A beginning has already been made to ensure greater outreachof banking facilities in rural areas through appointment of reputed non-governmental organisations (NGOs) / post offices, etc., as banking facilitators andbanking correspondents. A Working Group has also been proposed to ensuregreater outreach of banking facilities in rural areas and to ensure availability ofbank finance at reasonable rates. A Working Group has also been proposed tosuggest measures for assisting distressed farmers, including provision of financialcounselling services and introduction of a specific Credit Guarantee Scheme underthe Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) Act. Theconvenors of the State Level Bankers Committee in all States/Union Territorieshave been advised to identify at least one district in their area for achieving 100 percent financial inclusion by providing a 'no-frills' account and a general purposecredit card (GCC). A Technical Group has also been proposed to renew theexisting legislative framework governing money lending and its enforcementmachinery so as to provide for greater credit penetration by the financial sector inthe rural areas at reasonable rates of interest.The final area that has gained prominence in the recent past relates tocustomer service. The focus of attention is on basic banking services provided tothe common persons and the need for ensuring effective customer grievanceredressal as also fair practice code. A Banking Ombudsman facility has beenestablished covering all States and Union Territories for redressal of grievancesagainst deficient banking services. The recently constituted Banking Codes andStandards Board of India is an important step in this regard which is expected toensure that the banks formulate and adhere to their own comprehensive code ofconduct for fair treatment of customers. Additionally, constitution of a WorkingGroup has been proposed in the latest policy to formulate a scheme for ensuringreasonableness of charges offered by banks on its various services.It is widely acknowledged that India is the repository of the best of humanskills, especially in the financial sector. The technological competence of the Indianworkforce is perhaps presently part of folklore. The present levels of growthoptimism about the economy suggest that India is expected to remain one of theimportant growth drivers of the global economy in the near future. The financialinfrastructure and regulatory framework in the country are broadly on par with thoseprevailing internationally. We are working towards evolving a globally competitivebanking sector, stressing on banking services relevant to our socio-economicconditions and contributing to both growth and stability.
