Monetary and Financial Sector Reforms in India:A Practitioner's Perspective *Draft for DiscussionFor Private CirculationThe objectives of this paper are to review the monetary and financial sectorreforms in India, identify the emerging issues and explore the prospects for furtherreform.  The first part is devoted to a brief background on the need for reforms taken upin 1991-92. The second part is devoted to the institutional aspects of the reform. Issuesrelating to ownership, competition and regulation in the financial sector as a whole, butprimarily in the banking sector are analysed.  The third part relating to policy frameworkfocuses on monetary policy and credit delivery. The fiscal policy insofar as it impacts onthe financial sector is also analysed.  The fourth part focuses on managing process ofreform in its various dimensions and perspective is that of the Reserve Bank of India(RBI).  The concluding part identifies the critical elements that would possibly determinethe progress of reform.Need for ReformsThe Indian financial system of the pre-reform period essentially catered to theneeds of planned development in a mixed-economy framework where theGovernment sector had a predominant role in economic activity. As part of planneddevelopment, the macro-economic policy in India moved from fiscal neutrality to fiscalactivism (Reddy 2000).  Such activism meant large developmental expenditures, much ofit to finance long-gestation projects requiring long-term finance. The sovereign was also1expected to raise funds at fine rates, and understandably at below the market rates forprivate sector. In order to facilitate the large borrowing requirements of the Government,interest rates on Government securities were artificially pegged at low levels, which wereunrelated to market conditions.  The government securities market, as a result, lost itsdepth as the concessional rates of interest and maturity period of securities essentiallyreflected the needs of the issuer (Government) rather than the perception of the market.The provision of fiscal accommodation through ad hoc treasury bills (issued on tap at 4.6per cent) led to high levels of monetisation of fiscal deficit during the major part of theeighties.  In order to check the monetary effects of such large-scale monetisation, the cashreserve ratio (CRR) was increased frequently to control liquidity.The environment in the financial sector in these years was thus characterised bysegmented and underdeveloped financial markets coupled with paucity of instruments.The existence of a complex structure of interest rates arising from economic and socialconcerns of providing concessional credit to certain sectors resulted in “crosssubsidisation” which implied that higher rates were charged from non-concessionalborrowers.  The regulation of lending rates, led to regulation of deposit rates to keep costof funds to banks at reasonable levels, so that the spread between cost of funds and returnon funds is maintained.  The system of administered interest rates was characterised bydetailed prescription on the lending and the deposit side leading to multiplicity andcomplexity of interest rates.By the end of the eighties, the financial system was considerably stretched. Thedirected and concessional availability of bank credit with respect to certain sectorsresulted not only in distorting the interest rate mechanism, but also adversely affected the2viability and profitability of banks. The lack of recognition of the importance oftransparency, accountability and prudential norms in the operations of the banking systemled also to a rising burden of non-performing assets.In sum, there was a de facto joint family balance sheet of Government, RBI andcommercial banks, with transactions between the three segments being governed by planpriorities rather than sound principles of financing inter-institutional transactions (Reddy,November 2000).  There was a widespread feeling that this joint family approach, whichsought to enhance efficiency through co-ordinated approach, actually led to loss oftransparency, of accountability and of incentive to measure or seek efficiency.The policies pursued did have many benefits, although the issue of the highercosts incurred to realize the laudable objectives remains. Thus, the post-nationalisationphase witnessed significant branch expansion to mobilise savings and there was a visibleincrease in the flow of bank credit to important sectors like agriculture, small-scaleindustries, and exports. However, these achievements have to be viewed against themacro-economic imbalances as well as gross inefficiencies at the micro level in thefinancial sector compounded by non-transparent accounting of intra-public sectorfinancial transactions.Institutional Aspects of ReformsInstitutionsAt present, the institutional structure of the financial system is characterised by(a) banks, either owned by the Government, RBI or private sector (domestic or foreign)and regulated by the RBI; (b) development financial institutions and refinancinginstitutions, set up either by a separate statute or under Companies Act, either owned by3Government, RBI, private or other development financial institutions and regulated bythe RBI and (c) non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), owned privately and regulatedby the RBI.Since the onset of reforms, there has been a change in the ownership pattern ofbanks. The legislative framework governing public sector banks (PSBs) was amended in1994 to enable them to raise capital funds from the market by way of public issue ofshares. Many public sector banks have accessed the markets since then to meet theincreasing capital requirements, and until 2001-02, Government made capital injectionsout of the Budget to public sector banks, totalling about 2 per cent of GDP. TheGovernment has initiated legislative process to reduce the minimum Governmentownership in nationalized banks from 51 to 33 per cent, without altering their publicsector character. The underlying rationale of the proposal appears to be that the salutaryfeatures of public sector banking is not lost in the transformation process.Reforms have altered the organizational forms, ownership pattern and domain ofoperations of financial institutions (FIs) on both the asset and liability fronts. Drying upof low cost funds has led to an intensification of the competition for resources for bothbanks and FIs. At the same time, with banks entering the domain of term lending and FIsmaking a foray into disbursing short-term loans, the competition for supply of funds hasalso increased.  Besides, FIs have also entered into various fee-based services like stock-broking, merchant banking, advisory services and the like. Currently, while IndustrialCredit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd. (ICICI) is in the process of finalising itsmerger with ICICI Bank, Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) is also expected41to be corporatised soon. At present, the RBI holds shares in a number of institutions. Thefurther reform agenda is to divest the RBI of all its ownership functions.In the light of legal amendments in 1997, the regulatory focus of the NBFCs wasredefined, both in terms of thrust as well as the focus. While NBFCs accepting publicdeposits have been subject to the entire gamut of regulations, those not accepting publicdeposits have been sought to be regulated in a limited manner. In order to consolidate thelaw relating to the NBFCs, regulation is being framed to cover detailed norms withregard to entry point and the regulatory and supervisory issues.CompetitionSteps have also been initiated to infuse competition into the financial system. TheRBI issued guidelines in 1993 is respect of establishment of new banks in the privatesector. Likewise, foreign banks have been given more liberal entry. Recently, the normsfor entry of new private banks were rationalised. Two new private sector banks have beengiven ‘in-principle’ approval under these revised guidelines. The Union Budget 2002-03has also provided a fillip to the foreign banking segment, permitted these banks,depending on their size, strategies and objectives, to choose to operate either as branchesof their overseas parent, or, corporatize as domestic companies. This is expected toimpart greater flexibility in their operations and provide them with a level-playing fieldvis-à-vis their domestic counterparts.As a group, however, the performance of PSBs in terms of profitability, spreads,non-performing assets and standard assets position seems to have been lower than that of                                           5the new private sector and foreign banks. There have been significant divergences inperformance among the public sector banks - some  have  performed  on  par  withprivate  and  foreign  banks,  whereas  theperformance of others has been relatively unsatisfactory. Hence, although PSBs havebeen subject to Government intervention, these do not appear to provide a completeexplanation of bank performance. Bank specific factors such as rapid expansion, higheroperating costs and differential industry focus seem to have been importantconsiderations as well. Public sector banks operating in the same environment with thesame constraints have shown varied performance; ultimately this reflects the performanceof management.Regulation and SupervisionA second major element of financial sector reforms in India has been a set ofprudential measures aimed at imparting strength to the banking system as well asensuring safety and soundness through greater transparency, accountability and publiccredibility.Capital adequacy norms for banks are in line with the Basel Committee standards2and from the end of March 2000, the prescribed ratio has been raised to 9 per cent.While the objective has been to meet the international standards, in certain cases, fine-tuning has occurred keeping in view the unique country-specific circumstances. Forinstance, risk weights have been prescribed for investment in Central Governmentsecurities on considerations of interest rate risk. Also, while there is a degree ofgradualism, there is an intensification beyond the 'best practices' in several instances in6recent period, an example being  exposure norms  stipulated for the banking sector inrespect of investment in equity. Investments are valued and classified into appropriatecategories, as per international best practices.  To take into account the vagaries ofinterest rate risks, a prescription for meeting a targeted Investment Fluctuation Reserveout of the realised profits from sale of investments within a stipulated time frame has alsobeen prescribed recently.The supervisory strategy of the Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) constitutedas part of reform consists of a four-pronged approach, including restructuring system ofinspection, setting up of off-site surveillance, enhancing the role of external auditors, andstrengthening corporate governance, internal controls and audit procedures. The BFS, ineffect, integrates within the Reserve Bank the supervision of banks, NBFCs and financialinstitutions.Prudential regulations have had a significant impact on the banking system interms of ensuring system stability even in the face of both external and internaluncertainties, almost throughout during the second half of the nineties. As at end-March2001, 95 out of 100 scheduled commercial banks had capital adequacy ration of 9 percent or more. There was a distinct improvement in the profitability of public sector banksmeasured in terms of operating profits as well as in terms of net profits to total assets.Reflecting the efficiency of the intermediation process, there has been a decline in thespread between the borrowing and lending rates as reflected by the decline in the ratio ofnet interest income to total assets. The most significant improvement has been in terms ofreduction in NPAs.                                                                                                                                 7Policy EnvironmentChanging Monetary Policy FrameworkSince the onset of the reforms process, monetary management in terms offramework and instruments has undergone significant changes, reflecting broadly the3transition of the economy from a regulated to liberalized and deregulated regime. Whilethe twin objectives of monetary policy of maintaining price stability and ensuringavailability of adequate credit to productive sectors of the economy to support growthhave remained unchanged; the relative emphasis on either of these objectives has variedover the year depending on the circumstances.  Reflecting the development of financialmarkets and the opening up of the economy, the use of broad money as an intermediatetarget has been de-emphasised, but the growth in broad money (M 3) continues to be usedas an important indicator of monetary policy.  The composition of reserve money has alsochanged with net foreign exchange assets currently accounting for nearly one-half. Amultiple indicator approach was adopted in 1998-99, wherein interest rates or rates ofreturn in different markets (money, capital and government securities markets) along withsuch data as on currency, credit extended by banks and financial institutions, fiscalposition, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinancing and transactions inforeign exchange available on high frequency basis were juxtaposed with output data fordrawing policy perspectives.  Such a shift was gradual and a logical outcome of measurestaken over the reform period since early nineties.                                           8The thrust of monetary policy in recent years has been to develop an array ofinstruments to transmit liquidity and interest rate signals in the short-term in a moreflexible and bi-directional manner.  A Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) has beenintroduced since June 2000 to precisely modulate short-term liquidity and signal short-term interest rates.  The LAF, in essence, operates through repo and reverse repo auctionsthereby setting a corridor for the short-term interest rate consistent with policy objectives.There is now greater reliance on indirect instruments of monetary policy.  The RBI isable to modulate the large market borrowing programme by combining strategic debtmanagement with active open market operations.  Bank Rate has emerged as a reasonablesignally rate while the LAF rate has emerged as both a tool for liquidity management andsignaling of interest rates in the overnight market. The RBI has also been able to use openmarket operations effectively to manage the impact of capital flows in view of the stockof marketable Government securities at its disposal and development of financial marketsbrought about as part of reform.The responsibility of the RBI in undertaking reform in the financial markets hasbeen driven mainly by the need to improve the effectiveness of the transmission channelof monetary policy. The developments of financial markets have therefore, encompassedregulatory and legal changes, building up of institutional infrastructure, constant fine-tuning in market microstructure and massive upgradation of technological infrastructure.Since the onset of reforms, a major focus of architectural policy efforts has beenon the principal components of the organised financial market spectrum: the moneymarket, which is central to monetary policy, the credit market, which is essential for flowof resources to the productive sectors of the economy, the capital market, or the market9for long-term capital funds, the Government securities market which is significant fromthe point of view of developing a risk-free credible yield curve and the foreign exchangemarket, which is integral to external sector management. Along with the steps taken toimprove the functioning of these markets, there has been a concomitant strengthening ofthe regulatory framework.The medium-term objective at present is to make the call and term money marketpurely inter-bank market for banks, while non-bank participants, who are not subject toreserve requirements, can have free access to other money market instruments andoperate through repos in a variety of instruments. The Clearing Corporation of India Ltdis expected to facilitate the development of a repo market in a risk free environment forsettlement. A phased programme for moving out of the call money market has alreadybeen announced and the final phase-out will coincide with the implementation of the RealTime Gross Settlement (RTGS) system. Further reform is being contemplated in terms ofreduction of CRR to the statutory minimum of 3 per cent, removal of established lines ofrefinance, limits on call money borrowing lending and borrowing by banks and PDs anda move over to a full-fledged LAF.With the switchover to borrowings by Government at market related interest ratesthrough auction system in 1992, and more recently, abolition of system of automaticmonetisation, it was possible to progress towards greater market orientation inGovernment securities. Further reforms in the Government Securities market haveresulted in the rationalization of T-Bills market, increase in instruments and participants,elongated the maturity profile, created greater fungibility in the secondary market,instituted a system of delivery versus payment, strengthened the institutional framework10through Primary Dealers and more recently Clearing Corporation, and enhanced thetransparency in market operations. Clarity in the regulatory framework has also beenestablished with the amendment to the Securities Contracts Regulation Act. A NegotiatedDealing System for trading in Government Securities is in operation. Furtherdevelopments in the Government Securities market hinges on legislative changesconsistent with modern technology and market practices; introduction of a RTGS system,integrating the payments and settlement systems for Government securities andstandardisation of practices with regard to manner of quotes, conclusion of deals andcode of best practices for repo transactions.   The movement to a market-based exchange rate regime took place in 1993.Reforms in the foreign exchange market have focused on market development withprudential safeguards without destabilizing the market. Thus, authorized dealers havebeen given the freedom to initiate trading position in the overseas markets; borrow orinvest funds in the overseas markets (up to 15 per cent of tier I capital, unless otherwiseapproved); determine the interest rates (subject to a ceiling) and maturity period ofForeign Currency Non-Resident (FCNR) deposits (not exceeding three years); and usederivative products for asset-liability management. These activities are subject to netovernight position limit and gap limits, to be fixed by them. Other measures such aspermitting forward cover for some participants, and the development of the rupee-forexswap markets also have provided additional instruments to hedge risks and help reduceexchange rate volatility. Alongside the introduction of new instruments (cross-currencyoptions, interest rates and currency swaps, caps/collars and forward rate agreements),efforts were made to develop the forward market and ensure orderly conditions. Foreign11institutional investors were allowed entry into forward markets and exporters have beenpermitted to retain a progressively increasing proportion of their earnings in foreigncurrency accounts. The RBI conducts purchase and sale operations in the forex market toeven out excess volatility.In respect of the financial markets, linkage between the money, GovernmentSecurities and forex markets has been established and is growing. The price discovery inthe primary market is more credible than before and secondary markets have acquiredgreater depth and liquidity. The number of instruments and participants in the marketshas increased in all markets, the most impressive being the Government Securitiesmarket. The institutional and technological infrastructures that have been created by theRBI to enable transparency in operations and secured settlement systems. The presenceof foreign institutional investors has strengthened the integration between the domesticand international capital markets.Credit DeliveryThe reforms have accorded greater flexibility to banks to determine both thevolume and terms of lending. The RBI has moved away from microregulation of credit tomacro management. External constraints to the banking system in terms of the statutorypremptions have been lowered. All this has meant greater lendable resources at thedisposal of banks.  The movement towards competitive and deregulated interest rateregime on the lending side has been completed with linking of all lending rates to PLR ofthe concerned bank and the PLR itself has been transformed into a benchmark rate.As a result of reforms, borrowers are able to the get credit at lower interest rates.The lending rate between 1991-92 and 2001-02 has declined from about 19.0 per cent to12current levels of 10.5-11.0 per cent. The actual lending rates for top rated borrowerscould even be lower since banks are permitted to lend at below Prime Lending Rate(PLR). Further, since banks invest in Commercial Paper (CP), which is more directlyrelated to money market rates, many top rated borrowers are able to tap bank funds atrates below the prime lending rates. These developments have been possible to banksbecause the overall flexibility now available in the interest rate structure has enabledthem to reduce their deposit rates and still improve their spreads.In terms of priority sector credit also, the element of subsidisation has beenremoved although some sort of directed lending to Agriculture, Small Scale Industry(SSI) and export sector have been retained. The definition of priority sector has beengradually increased to help banks make loans on commercially viable terms.  However,the actual experience has been that the credit pick up is not up to the mark and has beengenerally less than projected by the RBI in its monetary policies, in a number of years.Also, while in general the rates of interest have come down, they are available more tohighly rated borrowers than to the small and medium enterprises. There is considerableconcern about the inadequate flow of resources to rural areas, and in particularagriculture, while interest rates have not been reduced to the extent they were, for thecorporate sector.Fiscal Policy and Financial SectorThere are several channels that link the fiscal and financial sectors and in theIndian context four of them appear significant.  These relate to (a) governments’borrowing programme; (b) guarantees extended by governments; (c) mechanisms such as‘direct debits’; and (d) governments’ investments in financial sector.13The market borrowing programme of the central government continued to berelatively large, both in gross and net terms.  Since a large part of the borrowingprogramme has to be completed in the first half of the fiscal year, in view of seasonalityfor demand for credit on private account, the monthly average borrowing by centre isaround three quarters of a percent of GDP in recent years.  Further, there has been anupward revision in the borrowing programme of central government during the course ofevery year, usually, around three quarters of a percent of GDP.  It has been possible forRBI as debt manager to complete the borrowing programme while pursuing its interestrate objectives without jeopardizing external balance, by recourse to several initiatives interms of institution, instruments, incentives and tactics.  At the same time, it has beenable for RBI to reduce statutory preemptions in regard to banks to the prescribedminimum of 25% of their net liabilities.  The banking system, in which PSBs account forabout three quarters of activity, holds majority of the outstanding stock of governmentsecurities, and currently their holdings in excess of statutory prescriptions are far inexcess of the annual borrowing programme of the Central and State Governments.  In anycase, a large part of outstanding government securities are held by Government ownedfinancial institutions, especially in banking and insurance sectors.  RBI has so far beenable to successfully reconcile the interests of Government as its debt manager and ofbanks as regulator and supervisor.  In this regard, recognizing the importance ofcontaining interest rate risks and widening the participant profile, RBI has prescribed anInvestment Fluctuation Reserve for banks and is pursuing retailing of governmentsecurities. While technological, institutional and procedural bottlenecks for retailing are14being overcome by RBI, some of the constraints such as tax treatment and relatively highadministered interest rates do persist.The conduct of borrowing programme of State Governments is, however, posingseveral problems.  While the market borrowing programme of states in aggregate is wellbelow a quarter of centre’s market borrowings, in a liberalized environment, bankscannot be compelled to subscribe to the programme.  It was necessary to provideinvestors a premium for states’ paper over the centre’s paper of a comparable maturity.Of late, the premium is widening and differing as between states, while in the case ofsome states, there have been some difficulties in ensuring subscriptions.  In recent years,the increases in states’ borrowing programme over the budgeted amounts have been largewith the attendant problems of garnering subscriptions. It has, however, been possible forRBI to conduct the programme without serious disruption in the markets, since somestates have also begun to take initiatives to improve their fiscal profile and discharge theirliabilities, especially to banks, in a timely fashion.  It is necessary to recognise that size ofgovernment borrowings is only one element in public debt management, since there areother liabilities also, especially ballooning of pension liabilities.In this regard, extra budgetary transactions are also emerging, which impinge onthe balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions which take an exposure onthem.  For example, “oil bonds” to settle government’s dues to public sector oilcompanies and “power bonds” to settle dues from State Electricity Boards to nationallevel power utilities fall in this category.  Banks exposure to food credit, which is in thenature of funding of buffer stock operations is also relatively large at over 2.0% of GDP.RBI had been advocating that a law be passed imposing a ceiling on government15borrowings as enabled by the Constitution, but more recently, a Bill is undercontemplation for fiscal responsibility at the centre and several states.Financial intermediaries, especially banks, take exposures with a great degree ofcomfort when there is a sovereign guarantee. Such guarantees are often formallyextended and notified as such to the legislative bodies and financial markets.  RBI hasencouraged governments to pass a legislation prescribing a ceiling on such guaranteesand also charge a fee without exception to ensure credibility to guarantees and comfort tosubscribers.  Several State Governments have passed such legislations, though some areless stringent than others.  In view of the magnitudes of such guarantees by many States,banks have been advised to exercise due diligence in subscribing to them.  Apart fromexplicit guarantees, recourse is occasionally made by governments to letters of comfortwhich have a similar effect, and RBI has been dissuading such relatively non-transparentpractices.There are, in addition, what may be termed as “implicit-guarantees” which havemaximum linkage between fiscal and financial sectors.  A predominant point of financialintermediation through banks, mutual funds, and insurance, in spite of significant reformis undertaken by publicly owned or government backed financial institutions. Hence,public tend to repose confidence with a corresponding implicit direct obligation on thepart of government to protect the interests of depositors or investors.  Such a reasonableexpectation is not only justified on the considerations of reputational risk and the conceptof “holding out’ or backing, but also by the obligations discharged in the past by theGovernment of India, in several cases; some of them at the instance of regulatorconcerned.16In some cases, banks and financial institutions seek and obtain instructions fordirect debit of dues to them from government accounts to ensure the timely recovery ofdues to them and thus bring about comfort through credit enhancement.  Since large scalerecourse to such mechanisms, especially when State Governments are under fiscal strainhas the potential of eroding both the integrity of budget process and the de facto comfortto financial intermediaries, RBI has been vigorously advocating avoidance of recourse tosuch direct debit mechanisms.The governments have, in its asset portfolio, equity holding and some debts offinancial intermediaries that they own, and financial returns on these do impact the fiscalsituation.  More important, whenever pockets of vulnerability arise in financial sector, theheadroom available in the fiscal situation to provide succour to financial entities needs tobe assessed.  Fortunately, on present reckoning, the magnitudes of the few pockets ofvulnerability appear to be manageable without undue fiscal strain.In assessing fiscal financial linkage, the scope for money financing of budgetsvis-à-vis bond financing also needs to be considered.  Since there are elements of opencapital account, the maneuverability for RBI in the short-term to monetize government’sdeficit is severely circumscribed by the direction and magnitudes of such flows.  Keepingthese considerations in view, RBI and Government have agreed upon freedom to RBI todetermine the extent of monetization of government budget consistent with macro-economic stability.Managing the Process of ReformFinancial Sector Reform and Changes in Law17Any reform has both public and private dimensions, and ideally all participantsshould recognize the emerging new realities, assess costs and benefits and make attemptsto cope.  Reform outcomes should thus, be related not only to public action but alsoseveral other factors.  In public action itself, there can be legal, policy and proceduralaspects including subordinate legislations and institutional changes.  There arepossibilities of significant policy and procedural changes within a given legal frameworkand these need to be explored since changes in law are often difficult to get through inany democratic process.RBI has been articulating the need for appropriate changes in Law, assisting theGovernment in the process and has also been brining about changes in the financial sectorwithout necessarily waiting for changes in law.  Thus, several legislative measuresaffecting ownership of banks, IDBI, debt recovery, regulation of non banking financialcompanies, foreign exchange transactions and money market have been completed.Those on the anvil include measures relating to fiscal and budget management, publicdebt, deposit insurance, securitization and foreclosure, and prevention of moneylaundering.  The agenda for further legal reform, as identified by several AdvisoryGroups relate to RBI, Banking Regulations, Companies, Chartered Accountant, Income-tax, Bankruptcy, Negotiable Instruments, Contracts, Unit Trust of India, etc.The legislative process is complex in a democratic set up and it will beinadvisable to rush into legislation through a “big bang” approach.  Furthermore, manyelements of economic reform and underlying legislative framework need to beharmonized.  At the same time, it may not be necessary to wait for legislative frameworkto change to bring about some of the reforms or initiate processes to demonstrate18usefulness of reform-orientation.  In fact, there are several examples of managing reformwithin constraints of law which need to be recalled.  For example, there are someenabling but not mandated provisions which may or may not be used. Thus, RBI hadshed its direct developmental role in the sense of money financing, by ceasing to operateon relevant provision and by and large, confining money creation for Government ofIndia only.  Supplemental agreement to terminate automatic monetization (WMA) ofgovernment’s deficit has been used, by way of a signed agreement between RBI andGovernment of India, though a legislative compulsion in still under consideration as partof Fiscal Responsibility and Management Bill.In several cases, contracts with stipulated conditions have been framed in theabsence of specific law governing such transactions. Examples relate to regulation ofClearing Houses; operating current payment systems and functioning of electronictrading even before instructions under I.T. Act came into force. Similarly, it has beenpossible to invoke prudential regulations over RBI regulated financial institutions toeffectuate best practices in financial markets, though the legal compulsion as a regulationon all market participants may not be possible; the example of successes achieved aredematerialisation of Commercial Paper and Demateralisation of Debt instruments,brought about in the requirements on Banks and financial institutions.  There could alsobe use of incentives to conform though legal or formal regulation may be difficult.Examples relate to valuation and accounting norms being performed by a self regulatoryorganization and adopted by banks and proposals relating to information sharing withCredit Information Bureau pending legislative initiatives.  A deliberate decision may betaken not to use regulatory powers, thus enabling development of markets.  For example,19current account convertibility in external sector was implemented even before a new lawwas introduced by recourse to large scale relaxations.  Similarly, Credit Guarantee wasvirtually given up though a new law is yet to be enacted giving up the credit-guaranteefunction of Deposit Insurance Guarantee Corporation. In all these cases, however, apositive approach to law to enable reform was possible because of clarity about what wasto be done and finding of legal ways of doing even if it were second best.Managing Uncertainties During ReformReforms in the financial sector had to be implemented keeping in view not onlythe desirable directions and appropriate measures carefully sequenced, but also theemerging uncertainties, both in domestic and global arena.  By all accounts, India hasmanaged the uncertainties reasonably well. Recognizing that such uncertainties have atendency to impact the exchange rate, it is instructive to briefly review the processes ofmanagement and drawn some tentative lessons.  The Gulf crisis, which triggered thereform process was managed without any reschedulement of any contractual obligation,but with a recourse to stabilization measures and initiation of structural reforms.  Thecurrent account convertibility in 1994 led to liberalization of gold imports and largecapital inflows upto 1996.  In 1997, the timely efforts to depreciate the currency wardedoff a possible crisis due to persistence of a relatively over valued rupee in the forexmarkets.  This also enabled the implementation of a package of monetary and otherprompt actions in resisting contagion effects of Asian crisis in late 1997 and early 1998.The imposition of sanctions by U.S. government and others consequent upon nucleartests required replacement of normal debt flows with a type of extra ordinary financing.20There was also an occasion, as in May-August 2000 where inexplicable changesin expectations put pressure on the currency warranting yet another package to counterthe market sentiment.  In contrast the events of September 11, 2001 needed measures toreassure the markets with timely liquidity and stability in monetary measures.  Thereasonable success in managing these uncertainties while adding to forex reserves withmarginal addition to total external debt but maintaining both reasonable overall macro-economic stability and pace of reform in financial sector has some tentative lessons tooffer. First, stable and appropriate policies governing overall management of theexternal sector are important. As part of the reform process, a policy framework wasdeveloped to gradually liberalise the external sector, move towards total convertibility oncurrent account, encourage non debt credit inflows while containing all external debtespecially short term debt in capital account and make the exchange rate largely marketdetermined. The policy reform in the external sector, accompanied by other changes wasguided by the Report of High Level Committee on Balance of Payments, April 1993(Chairman Dr.C.Rangarajan).Second, the impression that a closed economy is less vulnerable to crisis is notborne out by facts.  India was a closed economy on the eve of the Gulf Crisis but theimpact was severe.  Though it is now a relatively more open economy, it could withoutserious disruptions withstand several uncertainties. Third, as evident from experience, ifthe fundamentals are weak, the economy is more vulnerable in the face of uncertainties.Fourth, in all instances of serious uncertainties, the existence and manifestation ofharmonious relations between the Government and the central bank become critical and21appropriate coordination is extremely useful. Fifth, while it is difficult to anticipate orassess the uncertainties, there may be advantages in taking the risk of early action thanlate action. Sixth, while in a rapidly changing world of uncertainties, commitment toideology can prove to be a drag on policy, especially in emerging countries, which areattempting structural transformation, it has been demonstrated by events the world overas well as by the Indian experience, that when the going is good, government is perceivedto be a problem but when the going gets tough, effective public policy may be the onlysolution. As such, the state has a pivotal role in stabilizing the economy when there is aspell of stormy weather.Seventh, there may be need for several short-term actions to meet challenges butthis should not distort the medium term vision to proceed with economic reform toimprove standards of living.  In other words, it is necessary for the policy makers to beconscious and more importantly, essential for the policy maker to convince marketparticipants that some measures to meet the crisis are short term, while some others mayget embedded into the public policy in the medium-term.   Related to this approach and toreinforce this, there is advantage in designing measures that are easily reversible,preferably with an explicit indication that the measures are reversible even as they arebeing announced, though a specific time frame may not be prescribedEighth, as regards the techniques and instruments of managing uncertainties, theyhave to evolve keeping in view the reform process itself, especially developments infinancial markets, monetary policy, the nature, composition and evolution of marketparticipants and above all public opinion.22Ninth, it is necessary to have an appropriate mix of surprise elements andanticipated elements in policy actions for meeting any uncertainties.  As an example,when the markets are in need of comfort or assurances, when the convergence in theobjectives of policy makers and the markets are matched, and such convergence isobservable in regard to instruments, there is merit in taking the market into confidenceand proceeding accordingly.  Where there is a perception that the market expectationsand their possible actions in the direction are not considered to be desirable by the policymakers, it is always advantageous to bring an element of surprise preferably withfirmness and credibility so that all possible anticipatory actions as well as resistances areavoided. There may be occasions when the wavelengths of markets or segments thereofand policy maker differ significantly and in such circumstances, the conduct of policywould presumably be more complex and difficult.Finally, the issue of transparency is extremely important. There are manyoccasions where transparency is desirable but there are also occasions where instanttransparency is not entirely essential and could even be counter-productive.  Anacceptable approach seem to be one that practices transparency as a rule but the timing oftransparency could vary depending on the circumstances.RBI and GovernmentDuring the early 1960s, Governor Iengar identified four areas of potential conflictbetween the Bank and the central government. These were interest rate policy, deficitfinancing, cooperative credit policies and management of sub-standard banks. It may beof interest to note that these four areas are still some of RBI’s concerns.23During the post-reform period, the relationship between the central bank and theGovernment took a new turn through a welcome development in the supplementalagreement between the Government and the RBI in September 1994 on the abolition ofthe ad hoc treasury bills to be made effective from April 1997. The measure eliminatedthe automatic monetisation of Government deficits and resulted in considerablemoderation of the monetised deficit in the latter half of the Nineties.At the same time, with gradual opening up of the economy and development ofdomestic financial markets, the operational framework of the RBI also changedconsiderably with clearer articulation of policy goals and more and more publicdissemination of vast amount of data relating to its operations.In fact, during the recent period, the RBI enjoys considerable instrumentindependence for attaining monetary policy objectives. Significant achievements infinancial reforms including strengthening of the banking supervision capabilities of theRBI have enhanced its credibility and instrument independence. It has been pointed outby some experts that the RBI, though not formally independent, has enjoyed a highdegree of operational autonomy during the post-reform period.In terms of redefining the functions of the RBI, enabling a movement towardsmeaningful autonomy, Governor Jalan’s statement on Monetary and Credit Policy onApril 19, 2001 is a landmark event.  First, it was decided to divest RBI of all theownership functions in commercial banking, development finance and securities tradingentities.  Secondly, a beginning was made in recommending divestiture of RBI’ssupervisory functions in regard to cooperative banks, which would presumably beextended to non-banking financial companies and later to all commercial banks.  Thirdly,24the RBI signalled initiation of steps for separation of Government debt managementfunction from monetary policy. These measures would enable the RBI to primarily focuson its role as monetary authority and enhance the possibility of a move towards greaterautonomy.The emerging issues relating to autonomy of RBI can be addressed at differentlevels.  First, at the level of legislative framework, several suggestions have been made toensure appropriate autonomy and many of them are under consideration.  In particular,proposed Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill and other amendments toReserve Bank of India Act would cover significant ground.  Several other suggestionsrelating to legal framework, as recommended by the Advisory Groups are yet to be takenup.Second, at the policy level, there are three important constraints on the operationalautonomy even within the existing legal framework.  One, the continued fiscaldominance, including large temporary mismatches between receipts and expenditures ofGovernment warranting large involuntary financing of credit needs of Government by theRBI. Two, the predominance of publicly owned financial intermediaries and non-financial public enterprises, which has created a blurring of the demarcation betweenfunding of and by Government vis-à-vis public sector as a whole. Three, the relativelyunderdeveloped state of financial markets partly due to legal and institutional constraints,which blunts the effectiveness of instruments of monetary policy.  These issues need tobe resolved to enhance genuine autonomy.Third, at the operational and procedural level, there is a problem of “old habits diehard”.  In a deregulated environment, there is considerable scope to reduce micro-25management issues in the relations between the Government and the RBI. At the level ofdegree of transparency, there is a temptation to continue, what has been termed as the“joint-family approach”; which ignores basic tenets of accounting principles in regard totransactions between RBI and Government.Some Critical Elements for Progress in ReformIn spite of difficulties in prioritizing the elements relevant for reform, an attemptis made to mention some elements which present themselves as critical in the light ofexperience gained so far.  First, as elaborated in Governor Jalan’s recent statements onMonetary and Credit Policy, several legislative measures are needed to enable furtherprogress.  These relate in particular, to ownership, regulatory focus, development offinancial markets, and bankruptcy procedures.  Some of the serious shortcomings in theanticipated benefits of reform such as in credit delivery do need changes in legal andincentive systems.  In particular, there is need to focus on reduction of transaction costsin economic activity, and enhancing economic incentives.  Severe penalties in law,including criminal proceedings, may not be substitutes for increasing enforceability (i.e.,probability of being caught, prosecuted, and punished adequately and in a timelyfashion).  In regard to institutions, there is need to clearly differentiate functions ofowner, regulator, financial intermediary and market participant, to replace the joint-family approach that is a legacy of the pre-reform framework.Second, fiscal empowerment appears to be essential for obvious reasons.  Whilethe existing level of fiscal deficit may be manageable, the headroom available formeeting unforeseen circumstances appears rather limited.  The problem is somewhat26acute in regard to finances of states, which have serious structural problems and theirresolution is possible only through accelerated fiscal support from Central Governmentconsistent with the fiscal soundness of Central Government.  Some of the legal reformsmay also be necessary for this purpose and the link for further progress in the financialsector is obvious.  In particular, the nature of fiscal dominance does constrain theeffectiveness of monetary policy to meet unforeseen contingencies as well as maintainprice stability and contain inflationary expectations.Third, the reforms in the real sector are needed to bring about structural changesin the economy.  The liberalization of financial sector and of external sector can provideimpetus for further growth and in turn help more rapid progress only when accompaniedby reforms in the real sector, particularly in domestic trade.Fourth, there are what may be termed as ‘overhang’ problems in the financialsector, such as non-performing assets of banks and financial institutions.  There aresimilar overhang problems in other areas as well, and it is necessary to make a distinctionbetween what may be termed as flow issues and overhang issues.  There is merit ininsulating the overhang problem from flow issues and demonstrably solve the flowproblem upfront.  For example, in regard to food stocks there is addition to buffer stocksvirtually on a continuous basis and a policy needs to be evolved to tackle this flow.  Anyattempt to sort out the overhang accumulated excess stocks on an ad hoc basis wouldobviously have limited success.  Any solution to the overhang problem of largemagnitude is bound to be operational over the medium-term and may involve admissionof the magnitude of possible losses to be incurred.  Yet another example relates to thepower sector, where addition to capacities to generate without ensuring cost recovery27adds to the problem of accumulated losses.  Prima facie, the major areas withconsiderable overhang problems apart from the financial sector are public enterprises,pension and provident fund liabilities and the cooperative sector.  The criticality of theissue is in terms of their cumulative impact on financial sector as a whole.Fifth, it will be useful to distinguish between what a financial sector cancontribute and what fiscal action can contribute to matters relating to poverty alleviation.In the interest of efficiency and stability of financial sector, intermediation may have tobe progressively multi institutional rather than wholly bank-centred.  Social obligationsmay have to be distributed equitably among banks and other intermediaries but thatwould be difficult to achieve in the context of emerging capital markets and relativelyopen economy.  In such a situation, banks which are special and backbone of paymentsystems, may face problems if they are subject to disproportionate burdens.  Hence,mechanisms have to be found to reconcile these dilemmas.Furthermore, monetary policy is increasingly focused on efficient discharge of itsobjective including price stability, and this no doubt would help poverty alleviation,albeit indirectly, while the more direct attack on poverty alleviation would rightfully bethe preserve of fiscal policy.  Monetary and financial sector policies in India shouldperhaps be focusing increasingly on what Dreze and Sen call “growth mediated security”while “support-led security”, mainly consisting of direct anti-poverty interventions areaddressed mainly by fiscal and other governmental activities.28Select ReferencesBalachandran, G.

The Reserve Bank has enunciated that in processing specific proposals for themovement towards universal banking from concerned institutions, the overwhelmingconsideration would be to meet the strategic objectives of the concerned financialinstitution for meeting the varied needs of different categories of customers, while atthe same time, ensuring healthy competition in the financial system throughtransparent and equitable regulatory framework applicable to all participants in thebanking business. In such a situation, particular attention would be paid to theprimary need to ensure safety of public deposits, especially of small depositors, andto promote the continued stability of the financial system as a whole, and of thebanking system, in particular.2. As at end-March 2001, as many as 95 out of the 100 scheduled commercial banks(except Regional Rural Banks) had CRAR of 9 per cent and above. Thecorresponding figures for 1995-96 were 54 out of a total of 92 banks.3. The evolution of monetary policy during the nineties has been detailed in Reddy(May 2001).30
