* *Discussion Paper on Universal Banking and BeyondRespected garu, Dean of Deputy Governors ,  Talwar, and friends,There are many reasons why I am happy to be here and the most important of these is to havethe honour of being with Mr. Narasimham, the Bhishma Pita Maha of financial sector inIndia.  In fact, the Discussion Paper of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on “ Harmonising theRole and Operations of Development Financial Institutions and Banking “ (DP) relies heavilyon the report of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms or Narasimham Committee (NC).In fact, if the Discussion Paper (DP), does not appear to say much that is new, the faultentirely lies with, NC.  After all, NC left little that was unsaid on the subject for DP to makeThe DP was released in January 1999 and was discussed almost simultaneously as one of thesubjects in a Seminar on Financial Markets and Institutions: Development and Reformsorganised by the Society for Capital Market Research and Development.   This was followedup by two seminars, devoted exclusively to discussion on DP.  The first was by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and Industrial Credit and InvestmentMumbai.  The second was organised jointly by the Federationof Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and Industrial Finance Corporation of India at NewDelhi in March 1999.  RBI considers this meeting in the Administrative Staff College ofIndia (ASCI), as the finale, with a gathering of almost all the luminaries of financial world.  Itshould be possible in this seminar to come to definitive conclusions and arrive at consensusIn the Key Note address, therefore, I will start with some clarifications on the DP, in the lightof discussions so far. This will be followed by a narration of consensus arrived at so far onsome issues and, of issues that are yet to be resolved.  Some of the recent developments,international and domestic, may warrant looking beyond DP, especially on linkage betweenbanking and insurance.  A brief account of international practice would be relevant to us atthis juncture. Finally, in viewing  universal banking in a broader context including insurance,regulatory issues, especially regulatory coordination and regulations of conglomerates wouldcome up.  A possible approach to regulatory coordination is presented for discussion andAt the outset, it is necessary to be clear about focus of DP ; what it sets out to cover, so thatexpectations are appropriate.  The main focus is to rationalise and harmonise the relativeroles of banks and DFIs in future. Draft proposals in the DP address this issue keeping inview both the general approach to universal banking which has a primary regulatorydimension, and the long-term capital needs of the corporate sector which has a primarydevelopmental dimension.  Hence, DP should be considered in a slightly different, thoughrelated, context from immediate measures to solve the problems faced by DevelopmentFinancial Institutions ( DFIs), in raising long-term resources at reasonable cost in lieu ofconcessional resources that were available to them till the reform process began.  In fact,improved access to short-term resources through the traditional banking route helps diversifyDFIs’ business but would not necessarily add to the long-term resource base. The problems                                                       debate.Narasimham Clarificationon future actions.  Indeed, that is the purpose of this seminar, being the last in the series.Corporation of India (ICICI) in organised jointlyan impact!Shri Shri faced by the DFIs now or in the immediate future do require attention but their conversioninto universal bank, by itself is neither a necessary nor a sufficient option to overcome theSecond, there are  no legal or regulatory restrictions on adoption of universal banking inIndia.  There are, however, prudential requirements as also entry conditions applicable to allbanks and DFIs could certainly do banking business if they satisfy them. However, for there are two practical  impediments viz., (a) backlog of liabilities in a DFI on which reserverequirements have not been provided; and (b) the relatively high reserve requirements,particularly Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).  Needless to say, once the CRR is brought down byRBI from about 10 per cent to, say the statutory minimum of three per cent, or  even less inthe banking system,  DFIs would find it less cumbersome to satisfy the preconditions forbecoming universal bank.  RBI is committed to bring down CRR, and the pace would dependon fiscal and monetary conditions.  Thus, DFIs should find it easier to move towardsuniversal banking in future, as reserve requirements are brought down.Third, on the issue of reserve requirement on stock of liabilities of DFIs, a view is expressedthat such reserve requirements be applied only on incremental liabilities.  The suggestionwould appeal as a good bureaucratic solution for a DFI problem, but one should pause andconsider its acceptability as a defensible and true prudential measure. The real solution is tobring down the reserve requirements across the board.Fourth, there is a further suggestion that reserve requirements should be applicable only tocash and cash like liabilities in respect of banks. In other words, the reserve requirements areto be linked to the maturity profile of liabilities. This could operate in a way that would makeit easier for DFIs to become universal banks. This suggestion has large systemic implicationsand validity as a prudential measure needs to e looked at.Fifth, and here the issue relates to transition path.  A view is expressed that DFI should bepermitted to become universal bank immediately with a pre-determined timeframe in whichreserve requirements are to be met by DFIs.  Apart from implications of regulatoryforbearance and level playing field arguments, it may be difficult to design a straight jacketDFIs.Sixth, RBI can only indicate appropriate regulatory regime for universal banking, but wouldit be proper for RBI to impose a decision or insist on a time table for a DFI to becomeuniversal bank? The move towards universal banking, the pace and mix of services will bedictated by consumer demands and the response of concerned bank or DFI. RBI can only putin place an appropriate regulatory framework that enables rather than inhibits such a move,Seventh, and in the context of timeframe, there is an impression that the RBI insists on a year timeframe.  The five year timeframe was indicated as ‘ideal’, taking into account ajudgement on possible reduction in reserve levels in future and prospects of DFIs being ableto meet prudential requirements smoothly.  As mentioned in DP, there is no minimum ormaximum time prescribed for a DFI to become universal bank ; only an indicative or idealEighth, on the status of DFIs, for purposes of regulation, a formal legally tenable and clearlyidentifiable regulatory framework of RBI is available basically for banks and for non-banktime frame has been mentioned in the DP.fivewhile ensuring consistency with monetary policy and prudential standards.path which would meet the needs of diverse transition DFIs,difficulties.financial companies.  DFIs as a category are still loosely defined as indicated in DP and are ina way an amalgam of State/Central level, company/corporate forms, with different extentsand degrees of public sector ownership and performing refinance, direct finance and otherfunctions.  The DP had given an approach to bring them under a transparent framework asNinth, there are many issues which are relevant but were not covered by the DP for a numberof reasons. Thus, issues such as inherent and relative capabilities of DFIs and banks toundertake universal banking on an extensive scale; details of consolidated supervision; natureof pressure from consumers in favour of universal banking; pressures towards universalbanking due to globalisation and financial integration etc. have not been detailed. However,two of the issues not covered in the DP, but that have gained importance since circulation ofthe DP, relate to link with insurance and issue of regulatory coordination.  I propose to flagIt may be useful to recall major elements of the architecture of the financial system for thefuture envisaged in the DP and identify the consensus as well as unresolved issues as evidentFirst, while the approach to universal banking is generally endorsed, there are differencesamong the participants on the pace, and sequencing. Some felt that the DP’s indication of fiveyears was too long, while others felt that DFIs need to continue as specialised institutionslonger. Yet another view was that RBI was too flexible and a uniform framework and rigidtimetable was preferred to flexible, case-by-case approach advocated in the DP. There wasalso a view hat the consumers would drive the movement to universal banking, but regulatorshave to enable such pressures to operate, maintaining prudential standards and systemicstability. Enabling framework is to be timed and sequenced. Incidentally, a few questionedthe desirability of allowing 100 per cent DFI owned banking subsidiary as a backdoor entryto banking.  Perhaps, more detailed discussion on these with special reference to role of theSecond, some expressed that DFIs need to continue as DFIs and indeed should be accordedspecial support, while a few felt that DFIs operations themselves are hindering thedevelopment of corporate debt market. There were extreme views also that the demise ofDFIs is imminent and the issue is rebirth. There was some sort of agreement that there shouldbe in future, only banks and NBFCs, but the issue is how DFIs will transit to one of the twocategories and how are they to be treated and regulated by the RBI till a transition occurs.There is some reluctance among some participants to DFIs becoming “mere NBFCs”.  Theissue then is , what should they be, under what category of appropriate regulation by the RBIor by any other appropriate regulator. Further, if DFI opts to continue indefinitely  as DFI,would it then be an NBFC, and if so, under a separate or an existing category.  Mr. Khan, in arecent discussion paper on Corporate Governance mentioned that the financial institutionsshould be brought fully under the regulatory and supervisory ambit of the RBI.  He adds thatthe RBI/Department of Supervision need to devise suitable tools/norms for financialThird, there was a general agreement that banks are special for a country like India.

One view was that SLR should be dispensed with and CRR reduced straightaway, butthese decisions are taken not only on compulsions of universal banking, but essentially asFourth, though there has not been detailed discussion, there appears to be a consent in favourof consolidated approach to supervision and regulation.

A strong view was expressed that RBI should itself divest its shareholding to marketrather than transfer its share to Government.Eighth, the institutions concerned have not yet indicated formal initiatives towardsharmonisation such as constituting a coordination committee. But, a variety of fora have beenUniversal Banking and A formal process of examining the various issues pertaining to banks’ entry into insurancesector commenced a few days ago with consultations between Ministry of Finance, ReserveBank of India and Insurance Regulatory  Authority.  It is, therefore, appropriate that thediscussion on issue of universal banking, which till recently was addressed in a narrowcontext, is now widened to include insurance and adopts broader definition of universalAs mentioned in the DP, the term ‘universal banks’ in general refers to the combination ofcommercial banking and investment banking, i.e., issuing underwriting, investing and tradingin securities.  In a very broad sense, however, the term ‘universal banks’ refers to those banksthat offer a wide variety of financial services, especially insurance. International experienceindicates that while there has been deregulation of combining of commercial banking andinvestment banking, including securities business, deregulation concerning the combinationof banking and insurance business has been somewhat limited, at least until recently.Historically, the banking and insurance activities have been strictly segregated in mostbanking.Insurance : International Trendsoperating to ensure effective coordination.

Only licensed insurance companies havegenerally been allowed to engage in insurance activities and the business of insuranceThere is distinction between production of insurance services , i.e. underwriting which is theprincipal function and, distribution of insurance products, i.e., agency function. Restrictionsare most strictly adhered to in connection with the “production” of services; but approacheshave been much more flexible in the field of “distribution”.  Thus, banks have generally beenpermitted to act as distributors of insurance products.  Even here, however, several countriesAnother distinction that needs to be made is between providing of insurance services in-house and the ownership linkages with insurance companies. Restrictions on ownershiplinkages between banks and insurance companies have generally been considerably lesssevere than on the in-house provision of underwriting and distribution services. TheseOn banks taking up insurance activities ,  in most European countries banks are allowed to setup insurance subsidiaries (“downstream linkages”) but in some others such as US and Japan,restrictions do exist. The cross-country pattern of restrictions on the ownership of banks byinsurance companies (“upstream linkages”) is more or less like that of downward linkages.Most countries that do not in principle set any limits on down-stream linkages do not set themon upstream ones either.One of the diversification paths widely used by banks in recent years has been the penetrationof the insurance industry, either directly or, most often, through an alliance with an insurancecompany. As a result, financial conglomerates, which had previously been mainly limited tobanking and a range of securities activities, have increasingly extended their reach into theinsurance sector.Generally, banks have followed one of the three paths to  the insurance industry.  Some bankshave set up their own insurance company in recent years.   Some banks bought shares of theexisting insurance companies. A third group of banks has chosen to swap shares withInsurance companies in many countries have also acquired stakes in some banks.  Thoseshareholdings can be seen as an investment, or as a way of diversifying from the insurancebusiness, or, finally as a procedure for promoting the distribution of insurance productsBanks and insurance companies have shown common interest for a number of reasons.Commercial banks can use their distribution network to sell all types of insurance,particularly life insurance, to their traditional customers.  Insurance companies areexperienced in designing certain complex financial products and are offering financialproducts for placing savings that private customers find particularly appealing, such as,Most important, the combining of banking and insurance activities raises the serious problemof the dual regulation to which they are subject and this requires close co-ordination betweenthe agencies regulating them.retirement funds or single-premium insurance policies.through bank branches.insurance companies.restrictions have also been relaxed somewhat in a number of countries in the recent years.apply restrictions, such as a blanket prohibition or strict limits.companies has been largely confined to insurance and financial activities closely related to it.There are concerns among regulators that , any expansion in insurance activities by banks willresult in new and more managerially complex risks. Such risks could ultimately harm thebank itself. In such contingencies, there could be  increased claims on the deposit insuranceThere are three organisational ways in which banks could engage in insurance activities :  in-house, via a department of the bank;  via a separately capitalized subsidiary of the bank, orvia a separately capitalised affiliate of the bank holding company.  The regulators dorecognise that the risks to the bank will depend on the degree of integration and theUniversal Banking and Insurance : Indian SceneIn India, as and when insurance sector is opened up to the private sector includingparticipation by foreign investment, many entities including major industrial houses, banks,FIs, NBFCs and mutual funds may like to enter insurance business. Some of our banks havealready expressed interest in entering the  insurance industry. Some DFIs have also showninterest. The process of discussion has just begun and it would be appropriate to take a viewon the desirable extent of functional as well as ownership linkages between banking andinsurance business, both in public and private sector. There are legal aspects that need to beexamined so that enabling provisions or notifications are considered by appropriateregulatory jurisdiction and coordination is even more important, and on this also, an approachwill be suggested later.Banks in India are of a wide variety.  Two broad categories are commercial banks and co-operative banks.  In commercial banks category, there are nationalised banks, State Bank ofIndia and its subsidiaries, foreign banks and private sector banks.  There are also RegionalRural Banks.  In co-operative banks category, there are state co-operative banks, central co-operative  banks, primary or urban co-operative banks. The linkages between these differentPresently, there is no provision in the Banking Regulation Act whereby a bank couldundertake the insurance business.  The Act may have to be amended before banks couldundertake insurance business. Alternatively, there is a provision in the Banking RegulationAct whereby banks could take any other form of business which the central government maynotify. Thus, if the central government notifies insurance business as a lawful activity for abanking company, perhaps banks would be able to undertake insurance business. It may, ofcourse, be necessary to specify what type of insurance business they could undertake.DFIs could be broadly divided into two categories, viz., those set up under the CompaniesAct, 1956 and those which  are statutory bodies set up under the Acts of Parliament.Companies set-up under the Companies Act, could be permitted to undertake banking andinsurance business provided it is allowed in the object clause of the Memorandum ofAssociation.  As regards statutory bodies, while there is no specific mention allowing   toundertake insurance business, but is should be possible for Government to permit by simplenotification. Technically, NBFCs, like other companies could also be permitted to  undertakeAs regards insurance companies, in order to stave off the risk of specialisation, insurancebanking and insurance activities, provided it is allowed in the Memorandum of AssociationFIsbanks and variety of insurance businesses need to be considered.organisational structure chosen in which to engage in insurance activities.fund or the safety net in general.institutions may also like to diversify, especially by entering into banking business.  This willbe possible only when the relevant Acts are suitably amended, and regulatory framework isThus, Government will have to take a view on linkages between banks and insurancecompanies, both as the owner of public sector banks, DFIs and insurance companies, and as asovereign that has to assign appropriate regulatory jurisdiction whenever the two activitiesoverlap. Indeed, the design of appropriate regulatory framework may be considered as a pre-condition for any notification or permission for banks or DFIs to be involved in any type ofinsurance activity. This would imply a view on the overall regulatory coordination in thefinancial sector. Since such common activities operate with scale economies, conglomerateswill have to be expected and appropriate regulation designed for such conglomerates.There are three important developments that have taken place in recent years which arerelevant to this debate on an appropriate regulatory framework for India now. First, thequestion of supervision of financial conglomerates has gained significance, and globalconsensus would be relevant to us. Second, draft of a new capital adequacy framework hasbeen circulated by Bank for International Settlements which is under discussion. Third, areview of regulatory structures has been undertaken in many countries and for example, theThe Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates (Joint Forum) was established in early 1996under the aegis of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle Committee), theInternational  of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the InternationalAssociation of Insurance Supervisors (IAIA) to take forward the work of the Tripartite Groupwhose report was released in July 1995.  The  Forum has examined ways to enhancesupervisory coordination, including the benefits and drawbacks to establishing criteria toidentify and define the responsibilities of a coordinator. The papers prepared by the Forumrelate to Capital Adequacy Principles, Fit and Proper Principles, Framework for SupervisoryInformation Sharing, Principles for Supervisory Information Sharing, Coordinator andThe Forum’s focus has been, primarily, on diversified financial firms with complexorganisational and management structures whose large scale activities cross national bordersand sectoral boundaries.  However, the lessons drawn and the guidance prepared could alsoThe new capital adequacy framework of BIS on banking, circulated as a consultative paper toreplace the existing BIS capital adequacy norms also addresses the issue of consolidation ofaccounts and capital adequacy. The banking accord is to be  applied on a consolidated basisfor preserving the integrity of capital base in the banking system. The new accord has to beextended to include, on a fully consolidated basis, holding companies that are parents ofbanking group.  As an alternative to full consolidation, the application of the accord on stand-alone basis, would be acceptable, provided investments in subsidiaries and significantminority owned stakes are deducted from the capital.

Our views need to be firmed up and transmitted toThere has, in the recent years, been an on-going debate about the most effective structure forfinancial services regulation.  It is driven mainly  by the rapid changes in the financialservices industry itself –blurring the boundaries between traditionally distinct forms offinancial intermediation and distinct categories of institutions through which suchintermediation took place. It is driven partly by public expectations in terms of both theprudential and the behavioural standards of  financial intermediaries. We are no exception toThere is a need to review our regulatory framework, not only in the light of the globalThe domestic compulsions that may warrant a review of the institutional structure of financialregulation in India are : (a) There are regulatory gaps, as for example private placement ofdebt. (b) There are regulatory overlaps; for example there is a growing recognition about thisissue from the point of view of developing market for securitised debt. (c) There is aperceived need for formal co-ordination between the regulatory agencies, which is currentlyoccurring through an informal high level group on capital markets presided over by theGovernor of the RBI with SEBI Chairman and Finance Secretary as Members. (d) A varietyof issues are coming up with regard to the issue of Government nominees on the regulatorybodies and their role in regulation.  Of course, in the Reserve Bank of India, the Governmentnominee is a member of the Board but is a non-voting member.  But, in other like SEBI, where there may be more than one nominee of Government, the question ofregulatory-autonomy arises, more so if the Government is also the owner of regulatedinstitutions. (e) There are new developments like the establishment of insurance regulatoryauthority.  There can be regulatory overlaps, for example, if State Bank of India diversifiesinto insurance business or insurance companies diversify into banking business. The conceptof universal banking implies multiple business activities. The institutional approach focuseson institutions (say, banks) while the functional approach focuses on business activity (saysecurities trading). The multiple business activities, especially through possibleconglomerates would need a review of regulatory framework.I had just a couple of weeks ago floated a tentative technical proposal in a seminar oncorporate governance, jointly sponsored by Dr.Yerram Raju of this College andDr.Y.R.K.Reddy of Yaga Consultants. Since there is no point in creating new bureaucracies,there are practical difficulties in massive redeployment of personnel, and expertise forregulation cannot be created overnight, some ways of filling up the regulatory gaps andoverlaps should be found without disrupting the existing regulatory structures.  The proposalis to explore the feasibility of an umbrella regulatory legislation which creates an apexregulatory authority without disturbing the existing jurisdiction.

The apex financial regulatory authority may be constituted, bystatute with the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India as Chairman and the members couldbe Chairmen of the three regulatory agencies. The apex body should also include someoutside experts on a part-time basis.  Finance Secretary could be a permanent special inviteeor a regular member without voting rights as in the case of the RBI Board.  The apexauthority could have by law, jurisdiction to assign regulatory gaps to one of the agenciesarbitrate on regulatory overlaps and ensure regulatory co-ordination. The apex authoritycould be serviced by a part-time secretariat of the RBI.  In a way the proposal improves andLet me hasten to add that between the apex regulatory authority that I suggested and super-regulator model, I will be tempted to prefer  the U.K. model of Super-regulator for only onepurpose.  Because ,  Deputy Governor of Bank of England moved as head of the new body,  Icould hope for Mr. Talwar’s elevation as super-regulator.  Yet, I would favour simplerFriends, I hope that the deliberations would provide significant guidance to many of us, andindeed should help resolve some issues now, while setting the agenda for future.I am also happy that the papers and deliberations of the seminar series on the DP would bepublished soon.*“Mr.Janakraj for his assistance Reddy is thankful to Harmonising the Role and Operations of Development Financial Institutions and Banks”, on June 28, 1999.
