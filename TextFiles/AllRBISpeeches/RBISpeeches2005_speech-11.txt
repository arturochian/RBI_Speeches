1Banks and Corporates as Partners in ProgressFriends,I am thankful to the organisers for giving me the opportunity to be with you anddeliver the valedictory address at the FICCI-IBA Conference on ‘Global Banking :Paradigm Shift’. It is noteworthy that eminent persons from diverse areas ofexpertise and experience have participated in the Conference; and quite a few ofthem are from global bodies such as, BIS and central bankers or bankingregulators from Mauritius, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, U.K. and U.S.A. Itis difficult to add significantly to the erudite discussions that have already takenplace. I am well aware that I will be disappointing some analysts here by notgiving my views on the macro-economic front and policy leads. This is aconscious choice as the formal announcement of the Mid-Term Review of theAnnual Policy is due in about a couple of weeks. Any meaningful statement byme on monetary policy would militate against the emergence of a collegiateapproach to monetary policy which is our avowed objective.I had some difficulty in choosing a subject for this address since the threeDeputy Governors and one Executive Director of the Reserve Bank India (RBI)have spoken at this Conference on almost all the relevant aspects and I alsohappen to fully agree with them. But the uniqueness of this Conference, in beingsponsored by a Chamber of commerce and industry, and the banks’ association,warrants some deliberation. Perhaps, it would be appropriate to dwell on certainaspects of how the banks and the corporates can nurture and strengthen theirmutually rewarding partnership while also contributing to the progress of oureconomy.At the outset, let me briefly recount the strengths of our banks and ourcorporates, as also the challenges faced by them. The performance of and                                           1 Valedictory address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the FICCI-IBAConference on ‘Global Banking : Paradigm Shift’ on October 7, 2005 at Hotel Hilton Towers,Mumbai .outlook for the banking sector in India, as evidenced by the movement in Bankexrelative to BSE Sensex in the recent years, appear to be positive. Both, thepublic and the private sector banks have gained in their equity prices and marketcapitalisation. The interest of Foreign Institutional Investors in the Indian bankingsector is considerable and it is widely believed that their exposure to this sector isat the top, amounting to about one-sixth of their total exposure to India. Thestudy of ‘India’s Top 20 Banks’ by the S&P / CRISIL, released this week,documents the steady improvement as well as their operating resilience andpreparedness for Basel II. The Report lists the challenges, the most importantbeing the risk-management and consolidation. RBI expects to release the Reporton Trends and Progress in Banking in a couple of months, which, I hope, will addfurther comfort to the analysts of our banking sector.Indian corporates have demonstrated that some of them are world-classwith noticeable overseas acquisitions; and the global as well as domesticexpectations from their entrepreneurship are perhaps unprecedented. S&P /CRISIL have also published a report on “Indian Top 50 Corporates” this week,which is candid in assessing the strengths of India’s corporate sector along withpossible challenges. As a central banker, I was struck by a remark in theIntroduction to the Report. The Report appreciates the overall financial profiles ofthe top 50 corporates and describes them as currently ‘strong’ to ‘adequate’ butcomments that the companies choosing to debt-finance their growth could facechallenges. It is in this context that the joint efforts of the banks and thecorporates in India could perhaps be an imperative for meeting the challengesahead.The relationship of the banker and corporate borrower in India has come along way from the days of highly regulated economy. During the last twodecades, there has been a sea change in the outlook of the banks as well as thecorporates towards each other. While the balance sheets of banks are nowstronger and their operations far more transparent, their lending practices too arebetter attuned to the requirements of various categories of borrowers. Thecorporates, on their part, have shown a greater sense of responsibility in the useand repayment of the borrowed funds. A noteworthy aspect is that under currentguidelines relating to External Commercial Borrowings, Indian corporates havebeen able to borrow significant amounts from overseas directly, based on theirown credit standing.In this context, it would be useful to recall some of the important policyinitiatives of the RBI relevant to bank-corporate relationship. Dr. Rangarajan’smonetary policy of April 1997 announced a package of measures permittingmultiple banking arrangements for the corporates and providing greateroperational freedom to the banks. Dr. Jalan’s policy pronouncements followedthrough this initiative with development of the money market, move towardsuniversal banking and above all, urging the banks and corporates to put in placesound risk-management systems – particularly for market risks. In 2003, RBIissued a Fair Practices Code to be followed by the banks which aimed at makingthem more responsive to the borrowers and enhancing the confidence ofborrowers in the banks as a source of funds. The procedure for declaringborrowers as “wilful defaulters” has been streamlined so as to afford fullopportunity to the corporates to present their viewpoint before so classifyingthem.Recent developments that warrant a careful redesign of the bank-corporate relationship include financing by multiple banks, through severalinstruments including investments, and access to a wider choice of sources offinance for corporates such as capital markets and external financing. Since suchchoices nudge towards transaction-based banker-customer relationship, thesecould impinge on the access to the information required by the bankers forfinancial assessment as also on the ability of corporates to get an assured andappropriately priced financial package. Perhaps there is a need forsupplementing transaction-based relationship between banks and corporateswith a more active and meaningful dialogue between them. I am sure suchmeetings do take place even now, but it is worth exploring whether the processneeds to be strengthened. In this regard, there may be an advantage in industrybodies like FICCI and IBA embarking upon a review of the existing practices ofdialogues between the banks and their corporate borrowers to ensure andenhance trust, transparency and timeliness – the three “t”s of banking. Such areview could perhaps also promote healthy competition amongst banks and addto the comfort of the corporates too.The Corporate Debt Restructuring Mechanism (CDRM), which becameoperational since March 2002, is another platform for banker-corporate interface.Its efficacy is evident in the fact that well over one hundred cases have beenapproved for restructuring under this system. The CDRM was reviewed recentlyby a Special Group and we expect to bring out, in a couple of weeks, the revisedoperational guidelines for improvements in the CDRM to make the restructuringsmoother for genuine cases.Another area of common interest to the banks and the corporates is therisk management. The lenders and investors have an obvious interest inaccurately assessing a firm’s risk-management performance, apart from itsunderlying financials, so as to understand the risks assumed by the firm andthose it has hedged or transferred to others. While the banks’ risk exposures andtheir risk-management strategy is usually an item of public disclosure, there is acorresponding need for corporates too to make adequate disclosures regardingtheir risk exposures, specially to derivatives and foreign exchange. This wouldenable the banker to assess the risk profile of the corporate accurately and toevaluate the appropriateness of various financial products on offer. While thesedisclosures could be made mandatory through the Accounting Standards – onwhich, I understand, ICAI is working – it would be desirable if the corporatesadopt such disclosures voluntarily, sooner than later, in their own as well as thesystem’s interest.It is useful for the bankers to track the changing dynamics of the pattern ofcorporate financing. The equity base of the corporate sector, relative to debt,seems to have increased, and many corporates are currently cash surplus,presumably to meet their investment commitments. Besides, the corporates alsohave access to other funding sources, especially external commercial borrowingsand domestic and global capital markets. The Development Finance Institutionshave substantially got subsumed in the banking sector and banks areincreasingly functioning as universal banks. Banks’ lending to households, be itthrough consumer credit or housing loans, has been increasing in the recent pastalong with increases in lending to priority sectors. It may, therefore, beworthwhile for banks, especially those with long history, to review their systemsand procedures for lending and extending other forms of support to thecorporates. An area of concern, in terms of public perception, is that there isunder-pricing of credit risk for private sector corporates while there could beoverpricing of risks in lending to agriculture as well as small and mediumenterprises. There is merit in reviewing the current procedures and processes ofpricing of credit, perhaps through a well structured segment-wise analysis ofcosts at various stages of intermediation in the whole credit cycle.We also notice that several corporates are active in treasury management.Hence, they need to be well-equipped to identify, measure, manage and controlthe risks especially when, often, they are counterparties to the treasurytransactions of the banks.Regulatory framework for banks is gradually encouraging banks to assessand manage the risks on their own while regulation focuses on the adequacy androbustness of the systems in vogue in the banks for the purpose.  The share ofcorporates in the lending by the banks, however, does not reflect the full range ofthe banks’ exposure to them as it does not capture significant exposure tocorporates through investments in bonds and other instruments.  More important,banks’ overall exposure would also include the non-funded exposures throughcredit substitutes and derivatives transactions which have grown significantlyover the last few years.  The continuing close linkage between the balance sheetof banks and of the corporate sector is, thus, clearly evident but only the natureof bank-corporate interaction is getting diverse and wider.  A regulator’s comfort,therefore, lies not only in satisfaction about the quality of risk-management in thebanks but also in the banks’ level of understanding of risk-management by theircorporate clients.  In a sense, there is an element of delegated supervision to beexercised by the banks over the corporates.  In this background, a closerongoing dialogue across a wider spectrum in a spirit of partnership between thebanks and the corporates adds to the comfort of the regulator.Consistent with the theme of the conference, it is essential to ponder overthe implications of the paradigm shift in global banking for the bank-corporaterelationship.  There are differences across countries in the role and functioning ofbanks vis-à-vis the corporates.  For example, the Anglo-Saxon, the Europeanand the Japanese practices do vary though there is some evidence of elementsof convergence with the emerging importance of trans-national corporates, globalbanks as well as financial intermediaries and increasing global financialintegration. In the bank-dominated financial systems, such as in India, bankssupport corporates not only by direct lending, but also through their positions inmoney, debt, equity and derivatives markets. Further, the industrial progressinvolves entrepreneurship, inevitably entailing some measurement andmanagement of implicit risks. As the partners in progress, the banks are nowcalled upon not only to manage the risks in lending but increasingly, to alsoassess the risks involved in the business to which they are lending. In thisbackground, the case for a more intense dialogue, to the extent of somepartnering, becomes stronger. Let me conclude by complimenting the organisers for the excellentConference; the participants who met me deeply appreciated the high qualitydeliberations at this truly global gathering.Thank you.
