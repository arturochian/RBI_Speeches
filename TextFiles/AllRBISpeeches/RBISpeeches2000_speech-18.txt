Respected Rating : Changing Perspectives Credit It should be clear that availability of accurate and timely information is vital for thehealth and efficiency of financial markets.  However, lack of symmetric informationbetween lenders or savers and borrowers or issuers is generally observed since, forexample, a manager of a project who issues bonds to borrow funds will have moreinformation about a project than a lender (i.e.) investor in the bonds. For savers,gathering of such information is costly and time consuming.  In a global environment,this asymmetry is even greater and the costs of collecting information is even higher.be defined as one which is engaged in the business of rating securities, and rating in turnmeans an opinion of the CRA regarding default probability of such securities, expressedin a standardised manner and made public. Default is generally taken to be a missed ordelayed disbursement of interest/principal, bankruptcy, receivership or a distressedexchange. Rating is mostly solicited by issuers for specific debt issues, althoughCRA is thus different from a mercantile credit agency like Dunn & Bradstreet, whichusually supplies general information on corporates.  It is also different from a creditbureau, which collates information on credit record of corporates or even individuals.Nor is it a credit assessing agency like the credit department of a commercial bank. Themost significant aspect of credit rating is that it is an opinion made available for public,functioning of financial markets, not only the savers or investors in bonds, but theThe modern rating system dates back to 1 909 when John Moody started ratingUS railroad bonds.

In other words, the rating measures the relative risk of an issuer’s ability andwillingness to repay both interest and principal over the period of the rated instrument.The ratings are usually provided through a simple symbol system like AAA that we areBroadly speaking, ratings are divided by the CRAs into three lev els, viz.investment-grade, non-investment grade and default grade.  The investment-grade isThe formal ratings are accompanied by detailed rationale, which some of theusers and those rated study carefully to get nuances of assessment.  The ratings thusindicated are subject to revisions.  The CRAs keep reviewing the ratings, and upgrade ordowngrade them as the circumstances change.

If they retain the right to print money, the question of default islargely an academic one.  The risk is that a country may service its debt throughexcessive money creation, effectively eroding the value of its obligations throughinflation.  When a sovereign borrows in foreign currency, the position is obviouslydifferent, since the sovereign borrower has to make available foreign currency to serviceSovereign risk generally refers to two types of risk : either a default by the sovereignGovernment on its foreign currency obligations or the risk that the country’s lack ofrating agency is also to assess the sovereign’s ability and willingness to ensurea foreign currency bond of a corporate, not only the commercial risk of the corporate isrelevant but also the currency-transformation risk attributable to macro policies of theHence, the sovereign rating is also important for other issuers in the6sovereign.availability of the foreign exchange necessary to meet obligations.

Sovereign ratings do not have longtrack record and the past record of sovereign defaults provides less reliable guide to theassessment of risk today, than in the case of a corporate.  The reasons for a corporatedefault are easier to discern than that of sovereign, since in the case of former there arelegal structures that can seize assets and change management. There is possibly a greaterelement of judgements or human will in sovereign defaults causing less predictability.Sovereign has the option, in extreme cases, of being able to access official sources fora potential sovereign default could also be different. While there are many commonfeatures between sovereign and corporate in debt markets, there are three special factorsin assessing default probability  of a sovereign, viz., behaviour of sovereign, of otherIn view of the above nature of sovereign ratings, it is necessary to understand the factorsthat appear to determine the ratings.  Empirical studies have tried to identify factors thatexplain over 90 per cent of the cross sectional variance of sovereign ratings.  First, themost potent factor was GDP per capita in US dollar terms.  High ratings were associatedwith high per capita income.  Secondly, high level of economic development measuredby the IMF’s classification as an industrial country accounted for a full rating increase.Thirdly, the history of default played a major role.  For instance, a recent history ofdefault set a rating back by about two notches.  Fourthly, the rate of growth in GrossDomestic Product was a positive factor.  Fifthly, high inflation was a negative factor.Sixthly, a country’s net foreign debt position was also negative.  Finally, the politicalfactors, especially political stability and willingness as well as ability to ensureThe extent to which changes in sovereign ratings affect market prices and creditavailability is difficult to assess.

Moody’sstarted rating India in 1988 with an investment grade rating.  S & P started rating Indiainformally, also with an investment grade rating in August 1990.  The external crisis of1991 prompted, both these agencies to downgrade India’s long-term sovereign creditrating to non-investment grade.

The ratings of India by these twoagencies would appear to convey that India in  1998 is no better off than it was in 1991.This is not intended even by the rating agencies.  The only explanation for this is theIndian credit rating agencies rate domestic currency obligations and the States of theUnion, somewhat indirectly. Implicit sovereign ratings of the States can be derived fromtheir State level undertakings or special purpose vehicles set up with State Governmentguarantees. In fact, both the market as well as CRAs themselves treat such ratings as aproxy for rating of State Governments. In doing so, CRAs take into consideration theeconomic structure of States, finances of State Governments and the economic andpolitical management including Human Development Index.  However, when a StateGovernment requests or solicits a rating for itself, the CRA takes up rating as has beendone in one instance recently. While viewing a rating, it is necessary to appreciate thebasis. For example, in the case of rating of a State, a CRA states that this rating view isIndia viewed as “Highest Safety” for local currency obligations.

Most regulators stipulate a list of recognised agencies whose ratings can beused to satisfy rating requirements. Broadly, there are three areas where extensive use ismade of ratings in the regulatory process, viz., investment restrictions on regulatedinstitutions; establishing capital requirements for financial and disclosure as well asissuance requirements. The issues faced by regulators in use of ratings includeThe RBI prescribes a number of regulatory uses of ratings.

The Committee has, therefore, proposed to replace the currentTo this end, the Committee proposes to use external credit assessments such as creditratings for distinguishing credit risk.

S & P encourages theBasle Committee to “establish a methodology for reconciling the existing diverse set ofpolicies, practices and rating scales currently in use among rating agencies or among thebanks”.  Moody’s is also candid in limiting the role of external ratings in the NewAccord. In their view, currently, credit ratings cover only a small portion of most banks’portfolios and the external ratings approach is unresponsive to the unique needs ofindividual banks.  Its implementation would introduce a number of adverse incentivesinto the credit risk services industry.

Thereafter, there is hardly any regulation.Similarly in UK, recognition as a rating agency is required from the Financial ServicesIn India, in 1998, SEBI constituted a Committee to look into draft regulation for CRAsthat were prepared internally by SEBI.

The most significant change in the recent past relates to emphasis onrating is a more recent phenomenon, but the changing global perspectives on the subjectdo impact the financial system.  In the light of the East Asian experience, it is clear thatappropriate disclosure of information and accounting standards across the board arenecessary to help viable rating systems.  While freedom of expression and independenceof CRAs would also help improve the systems, credit awareness by investors, especiallyon the operations of rating system needs to be encouraged. Several issues and dilemmasbeing faced by all stakeholders in the matter of credit rating should be self-evident fromthe presentation so far.  However, flagging a few specific issues of policy significance to On Sovereign Rating of India by global , in the light of what has beenof both the country's social ethos and our economic strengths and thus enable theCRAs also to enhance their appreciation of our track record and strengths in theexternal sector. I had articulated the importance of assessment of behaviour of asovereign in the context of assessment of sovereign rating and it is exactly herethat the social ethos and national character demonstrated by our track record of Sometimes, it is argued that such an enhancement of our credit rating toinvestment grade would facilitate a sovereign borrowing by India. I believe that,for several reasons, it is neither necessary nor desirable at this juncture forGovernment of India to seek sovereign borrowing in foreign currency ininternational financial markets, but the issue could be reviewed sometime infuture.  Though sovereign borrowing is advocated for India on the ground that itwill help develop a benchmark favourable to bond issues by our corporates ininternational markets, there are at present several disadvantages in sovereignborrowing that outweigh, in my view, the extent of possible benefit of I had explained earlier in the speech about the sovereign rating and guarantees inthe context of States. The major issue in this regard relates to treatment by CRAsof ‘letters of comfort’ issued by Central and State Governments as closer tothis issue since the magnitudes of bond issues by central and state level13them as farther from Government guarantees.

The subscription to the borrowing programmes ofare offered is being influenced by the bankers’ perceptions of the StateGovernment and hence some relevance for rating.  When the enterprises of aState seek borrowings through the State guaranteed bonds or Special PurposeVehicles, the rating becomes critical. In fact, recently rating agencies are evenarticulating their expectations with regard to fiscal policies of specific States inthis context.  For example, a recent statement of a rating agency on the subjectstates that the situation calls for fiscal consolidation by improving revenueand performance of the States economy.

Currently, RBI has taken steps to strengthen the DebtRecovery Tribunals and this should also contribute to speedy recovery by banks, Several initiatives with regard to the operational aspects of CRAs are beingis a view that CRAs could play a more active role in monitoring the structures ofstructured obligations that they have rated. It is held that CRAs may take intoconsideration the performance record of Trustees while rating issues. Further, There are reports that some banks have on occasions shown a distinct preferencefor investment in rated paper, often through private placements, over normalcredit operations.  While diversified instruments for credit delivery are desirablefor efficiency, excessive reliance on ratings without adequate internal assessmentis inadvisable.  Furthermore, there are reports that some banks tend to avoid therigour of process of credit appraisal by preferring to invest in rated paper.  Suchand medium enterprises.

The policy makers, and this includes the regulators, are facing some dilemmas inregard to ratings.  They are compelled by the circumstances to place increasinglygreater reliance on CRAs judgements, and at the same time, they are inclined toincreasingly question the CRAs’ judgements. Operationally, the regulators facethe problem of specifying or recognising a particular CRA’s rating since ratingsdo differ among CRAs.  Prescribing two ratings rather than one for regulatorypurposes may not fully address this issue.  One approach is that of the UnitedNations National Association of Insurance Commissioners which itself resolvesdifferences of opinion among CRAs.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authorityresolved the issue by comparing ratings of sample of issuers and subtracting thegrade higher. There have been proposals for rating the CRAs by regulators buthave not been found to be acceptable so far.  It is necessary for regulators toexplore ways of resolving the differences among CRAs while using them forregulator, there is a take it or leave it implication, resulting in pressures to obtainonly higher rating.  In such circumstances, the financial markets wouldeffectively shut out several investors and issuers willing to participate in ratingswith higher default probability.  There is thus, another dilemma for regulatorshere. The RBI will examine these issues while considering the use of ratings in(x) More generally, RBI has been in the forefront in advocating caution in use ofappreciation and indeed acceptance of our cautionary stand on the subject –especially the consequences of a short-end bias in rating.
