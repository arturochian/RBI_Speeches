Financial Sector Reforms and Monetary Policy: The Indian Experience?Rakesh MohanI. Introduction Since the initiation of reforms in the early 1990s, the Indian economy has achieved highgrowth in an environment of macroeconomic and financial stability. The period has been markedby broad based economic reform that has touched every segment of the economy.  These reformswere designed essentially to promote greater efficiency in the economy through promotion ofgreater competition. The story of Indian reforms is by now well-documented (e.g., Ahluwalia,2002); nevertheless, what is less appreciated is that India achieved this acceleration in growthwhile maintaining price and financial stability. As a result of the growing openness, India was notinsulated from exogenous shocks since the second half of the 1990s. These shocks, global as wellas domestic, included a series of financial crises in Asia, Brazil and Russia, 9/11 terrorist attacks inthe US, border tensions, sanctions imposed in the aftermath of nuclear tests, politicaluncertainties, changes in the Government, and the current oil shock. Nonetheless, stability couldbe maintained in financial markets. Indeed, inflation has been contained since the mid-1990s to anaverage of around five per cent, distinctly lower than that of around eight per cent per annum overthe previous four decades. Simultaneously, the health of the financial sector has recorded verysignificant improvement.India's path of reforms has been different from most other emerging market economies: ithas been a measured, gradual, cautious, and steady process, devoid of many flourishes that couldbe observed in other countries. I shall argue in this paper that reforms in the financial sector andmonetary policy framework have been a key component of  the    overall reforms that provided thefoundation of an increased price and financial stability. Reforms in these sectors have been well-sequenced, taking into account the state of the markets in the various segments.The main objective of the financial sector reforms in India initiated in the early 1990s wasto create an efficient, competitive and stable financial sector that could then contribute in greatermeasure to stimulate growth. Concomitantly, the monetary policy framework made a phased shiftfrom direct instruments of monetary management to an increasing reliance on indirect instruments.However, as appropriate monetary transmission cannot take place without efficient price discoveryof interest rates and exchange rates in the overall functioning of financial markets, thecorresponding development of the money market, Government securities market and the foreignexchange market became necessary. Reforms in the various segments, therefore, had to becoordinated.  In this process, growing integration of the Indian economy with the rest of the worldalso had to be recognised and provided for.  Against this backdrop, the coverage of this paper is threefold. First, I will give a synopticaccount of the reforms in financial sector and monetary policy. Second, this is followed by anassessment of these reforms in terms of outcomes and the health of the financial sector. Finally,lessons emerging from the Indian experience for issues of topical relevance for monetaryauthorities are considered in the final Section.II. Financial Sector and Monetary Policy: Objectives and ReformsTill the early 1990s the Indian financial sector could be described as a classic example of“financial repression” a la McKinnon and Shaw. Monetary policy was subservient to the fisc. Thefinancial system was characterised by extensive regulations such as administered interest rates,directed credit programmes, weak banking structure, lack of proper accounting and riskmanagement systems and lack of transparency in operations of major financial market participants(Mohan, 2004b). Such a system hindered efficient allocation of resources. Financial sector reformsinitiated in the early 1990s have attempted to overcome these weaknesses in order to enhanceefficiency of resource allocation in the economy.Simultaneously, the Reserve Bank took a keen interest in the development of financialmarkets, especially the money, government securities and forex markets in view of their criticalrole in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.  As for other central banks, the moneymarket is the focal point for intervention by the Reserve Bank to equilibrate short-term liquidity                                                          ?

The usual disclaimer applies.flows on account of its linkages with the foreign exchange market.  Similarly, the Governmentsecurities market is important for the entire debt market as it serves as a benchmark for pricingother debt market instruments, thereby aiding the monetary transmission process across the yieldcurve. The Reserve Bank had, in fact, been making efforts since 1986 to develop institutions andinfrastructure for these markets to facilitate price discovery. These efforts by the Reserve Bank todevelop efficient, stable and healthy financial markets accelerated after 1991. There has beenclose co-ordination between the Central Government and the Reserve Bank, as also betweendifferent regulators, which helped in orderly and smooth development of the financial markets inIndia.What have been the major contours of the financial sector reforms in India? For the sakeof completeness, it is useful to have a quick run-down of these:• Removal of the erstwhile existing financial repression• Creation of an efficient, productive and profitable financial sector• Enabling the process of price discovery by the market determination of interest rates thatimproves allocative efficiency of resources• Providing operational and functional autonomy to institutions• Preparing the financial system for increasing international competition• Opening the external sector in a calibrated manner; and• Promoting financial stability in the wake of domestic and external shocks.The financial sector reforms since the early 1990s could be analytically classified into two1phases.  The first phase - or the first generation of reforms - was aimed at creating an efficient,productive and profitable financial sector which would function in an environment of operationalflexibility and functional autonomy. In the second phase, or the second generation reforms, whichstarted in the mid-1990s, the emphasis of reforms has been on strengthening the financial systemand introducing structural improvements. Against this brief overview of the philosophy of financialsector reforms, let me briefly touch upon reforms in various sectors and segments of the financialsector.Banking SectorThe main objective of banking sector reforms was to promote a diversified, efficient andcompetitive financial system with the ultimate goal of improving the allocative efficiency ofresources through operational flexibility, improved financial viability and institutional strengthening.The reforms have focussed on removing financial repression through reductions in statutory pre-emptions, while stepping up prudential regulations at the same time. Furthermore, interest rates onboth deposits and lending of banks have been progressively deregulated (Box I).As the Indian banking system had become predominantly government owned by the early1990s, banking sector reforms essentially took a two pronged approach.  First, the level ofcompetition was gradually increased within the banking system while simultaneously introducinginternational best practices in prudential regulation and supervision tailored to Indian requirements.In particular, special emphasis was placed on building up the risk management capabilities ofIndian banks while measures were initiated to ensure flexibility, operational autonomy andcompetition in the banking sector. Second, active steps were taken to improve the institutionalarrangements including the legal framework and technological system. The supervisory systemwas revamped in view of the crucial role of supervision in the creation of an efficient bankingsystem.Measures to improve the health of the banking system have included (i) restoration ofpublic sector banks' net worth through recapitalisation where needed; (ii) streamlining of thesupervision process with combination of on-site and off-site surveillance along with externalauditing; (iii) introduction of risk based supervision; (iv) introduction of the process of structured                                                          1 Reddy (2002) noted that the approach towards financial sector reforms in India has been based on fiveprinciples: (i) cautious and appropriate sequencing of reform measures; (ii) introduction of mutuallyreinforcing norms; (iii) introduction of complementary reforms across monetary, fiscal and external sectors;(iv) development of financial institutions; and (v) development of financial markets.2and discretionary intervention for problem banks through a prompt corrective action (PCA)mechanism; (v) institutionalisation of a mechanism facilitating greater coordination for regulationand supervision of financial conglomerates; (vi) strengthening creditor rights (still in process); and(vii) increased emphasis on corporate governance.Consistent with the policy approach to benchmark the banking system to the bestinternational standards with emphasis on gradual harmonisation, all commercial banks in India areexpected to start implementing Basel II with effect from March 31, 2007 – though a marginalstretching beyond this date should not be ruled out in view of the latest indications on the state ofpreparedness (Reddy, 2006a). Recognising the differences in degrees of sophistication anddevelopment of the banking system, it has been decided that the banks will initially adopt theStandardised Approach for credit risk and the Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk. Afteradequate skills are developed, both by the banks and also by the supervisors, some of the banksmay be allowed to migrate to the Internal Rating Based (IRB) Approach. Although implementationof Basel II will require more capital for banks in India, the cushion available in the system - atpresent, the Capital to Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) is over 12 per cent - provides some comfort. Inorder to provide banks greater flexibility and avenues for meeting the capital requirements, theReserve Bank has issued policy guidelines enabling issuance of several instruments by the banksviz., innovative perpetual debt instruments, perpetual non-cumulative preference shares,redeemable cumulative preference shares and hybrid debt instruments.3Box IReforms in the Banking SectorA.

Technology Related Measures• Setting up of INFINET as the communication backbone for the financial sector,introduction of Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) for screen-based trading ingovernment securities and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System.4Reforms in the Monetary Policy FrameworkThe basic emphasis of monetary policy since the initiation of reforms has been to reducemarket segmentation in the financial sector through increased interlinkages between varioussegments of the financial market including money, government security and forex market. The keypolicy development that has enabled a more independent monetary policy environment as well asthe development of Government securities market was the discontinuation of automaticmonetisation of the government's fiscal deficit since April 1997 through an agreement between theGovernment and the Reserve Bank of India in September 1994. In order to meet the challengesthrown by financial liberalisation and the growing complexities of monetary management, theReserve Bank switched from a monetary targeting framework to a multiple indicator approachfrom 1998-99. Short-term interest rates have emerged as the key indicators of the monetary policystance. A significant shift is the move towards market-based instruments away from directinstruments of monetary management. In line with international trends, the Reserve Bank has putin place a liquidity management framework in which market liquidity is managed through a mix ofopen market (including repo) operations (OMOs), changes in reserve requirements and standingfacilities, reinforced by changes in the policy rates, including the Bank Rate and the short term(overnight) policy rate. In order to carry out these market operations effectively, the Reserve Bankhas initiated several measures to strengthen the health of its balance sheet.Over the past few years, the process of monetary policy formulation has becomerelatively more articulate, consultative and participative with external orientation, while the internalwork processes have also been re-engineered. A recent notable step in this direction is theconstitution of a Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy comprising external experts toadvise the Reserve Bank on the stance of monetary policy (Box II).Following the reforms, the financial markets have now grown in size, depth and activitypaving the way for flexible use of indirect instruments by the Reserve Bank to pursue itsobjectives.  It is recognised that stability in financial markets is critical for efficient price discovery.Excessive volatility in exchange rates and interest rates masks the underlying value of thesevariables and gives rise to confusing signals. Since both the exchange rate and interest rate arethe key prices reflecting the cost of money, it is particularly important for the efficient functioning ofthe economy that they be market determined and be easily observed. The Reserve Bank has,therefore, put in place a liquidity management framework in the form of a liquidity adjustmentfacility (LAF) for the facilitation of forex and money market transactions that result in pricediscovery sans excessive volatility. The LAF coupled with OMOs and the  Market StabilisationScheme (MSS) has provided the Reserve Bank greater flexibility to manage market liquidity inconsonance with its policy stance. The introduction of LAF had several advantages (Mohan,2006b).• First and foremost, it helped the transition from direct instruments of monetary control toindirect and, in the process, certain dead weight loss for the system was saved.• Second, it has provided monetary authorities with greater flexibility in determining both thequantum of adjustment as well as the rates by responding to the needs of the system on adaily basis.• Third, it enabled the Reserve Bank to modulate the supply of funds on a daily basis tomeet day-to-day liquidity mismatches.• Fourth, it enabled the Reserve Bank to affect demand for funds through policy ratechanges.• Fifth and most important, it helped stabilise short-term money market rates.5BOX IIReforms in the Monetary Policy FrameworkObjectives• Twin objectives of “maintaining price stability” and “ensuring availability of adequatecredit to productive sectors of the economy to support growth” continue to governthe stance of monetary policy, though the relative emphasis on these objectives hasvaried depending on the importance of maintaining an appropriate balance.• Reflecting the increasing development of financial market and greater liberalisation,use of broad money as an intermediate target has been de-emphasised and amultiple indicator approach has been adopted.• Emphasis has been put on development of multiple instruments to transmit liquidityand interest rate signals in the short-term in a flexible and bi-directional manner.• Increase of the interlinkage between various segments of the financial marketincluding money, government security and forex markets.Instruments• Move from direct instruments (such as, administered interest rates, reserverequirements, selective credit control) to indirect instruments (such as, open marketoperations, purchase and repurchase of government securities) for the conduct ofmonetary policy.• Introduction of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), which operates through repo andreverse repo auctions, effectively provide a corridor for short-term interest rate. LAFhas emerged as the tool for both liquidity management and also as a signallingdevise for interest rate in the overnight market.• Use of open market operations to deal with overall market liquidity situationespecially those emanating from capital flows.• Introduction of Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) as an additional instrument todeal with enduring capital inflows without affecting short-term liquidity managementrole of LAF.Developmental Measures• Discontinuation of automatic monetisation through an agreement between theGovernment and the Reserve Bank. Rationalisation of Treasury Bill market.Introduction of delivery versus payment system and deepening of inter-bank repomarket.• Introduction of Primary Dealers in the government securities market to play the roleof market maker.• Amendment of Securities Contracts Regulation Act (SCRA), to create the regulatoryframework.• Deepening of government securities market by making the interest rates on suchsecurities market related. Introduction of auction of government securities.Development of a risk-free credible yield curve in the government securities marketas a benchmark for related markets.• Development of pure inter-bank call money market. Non-bank participants toparticipate in other money market instruments.• Introduction of automated screen-based trading in government securities throughNegotiated Dealing System (NDS). Setting up of risk-free payments and system ingovernment securities through Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL). Phasedintroduction of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System.• Deepening of forex market and increased autonomy of Authorised Dealers.Institutional Measures• Setting up of Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy with outsideexperts to review macroeconomic and monetary developments and advise theReserve Bank on the stance of monetary policy.• Creation of a separate Financial Market Department within the RBI.LAF has now emerged as the principal operating instrument of monetary policy. Althoughthere is no formal targeting of a point overnight interest rate, the LAF is designed to nudgeovernight interest rates within a specified corridor, the difference between the fixed repo andreverse repo rates currently being 100 basis points.  The evidence suggests that this effort hasbeen largely successful with the overnight interest rate moving out of this corridor for only a fewbrief periods.   The LAF has enabled the Reserve Bank to de-emphasise targeting of bankreserves and focus increasingly on interest rates. This has helped in reducing the cash reserveratio (CRR) without loss of monetary control.6Given the growing role played by expectations, the stance of monetary policy and itsrationale are communicated to the public in a variety of ways.  The enactment of the FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 has strengthened the institutional mechanismfurther: from April 2006 onwards, the Reserve Bank is no longer permitted to subscribe togovernment securities in the primary market. The development of the monetary policy frameworkhas also involved a great deal of institutional initiatives to enable efficient functioning of the moneymarket: development of appropriate trading, payments and settlement systems along withtechnological infrastructure.Financial Markets The success of a framework that relies on indirect instruments of monetary managementsuch as interest rates, is contingent upon the extent and speed with which changes in the centralbank's policy rate are transmitted to the spectrum of market interest rates and exchange rate in theeconomy and onward to the real sector.  Given the critical role played by financial markets in thistransmission mechanism, the Reserve Bank has taken a number of initiatives to develop a pureinter-bank money market.  A noteworthy and desirable development has been the substantialmigration of money market activity from the uncollateralised call money segment to thecollateralised market repo and collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) markets.The shift of activity from uncollateralised to collateralised segments of the market has largelyresulted from measures relating to limiting the call market transactions to banks and primarydealers only. This policy-induced shift is in the interest of financial stability and is yielding results.Concomitantly, efforts have been made to broaden and deepen the Government securitiesmarket and foreign exchange market so as to enable the process of efficient price discovery inrespect of interest rates and the exchange rate (Boxes III and IV).It is pertinent to note that the phased approach to development of financial markets hasenabled RBI's withdrawal from the primary market since April 1, 2006. This step completes thetransition to a fully market based system in the G-sec market. Looking ahead, as per therecommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission, the Central Government would cease toraise resources on behalf of State Governments, who, henceforth, have to access the marketdirectly. Thus, State Governments' capability in raising resources will be market determined andbased on their own financial health. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime,restructuring of current institutional processes has already been initiated (Mohan, 2006c).  Thesesteps are helping to achieve the desired integration in the conduct of monetary operations.7Box IIIReforms in the Government Securities MarketInstitutional Measures• Administered interest rates on government securities were replaced by an auction systemfor price discovery.• Automatic monetisation of fiscal deficit through the issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills wasphased out.• Primary Dealers (PD) were introduced as market makers in the government securitiesmarket.• For ensuring transparency in the trading of government securities, Delivery versusPayment (DvP) settlement system was introduced.• Repurchase agreement (repo) was introduced as a tool of short-term liquidity adjustment.Subsequently, the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was introduced.• LAF operates through repo and reverse repo auctions and provide a corridor for short-terminterest rate. LAF has emerged as the tool for both liquidity management and alsosignalling device for interest rates in the overnight market. The Second LAF (SLAF) wasintroduced in November 2005.• Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) has been introduced, which has expanded theinstruments available to the Reserve Bank for managing the enduring surplus liquidity inthe system.• Effective April 1, 2006, RBI has withdrawn from participating in primary market auctions ofGovernment paper.• Banks have been permitted to undertake primary dealer business while primary dealersare being allowed to diversify their business.• Short sales in Government securities is being permitted in a calibrated manner whileguidelines for ‘when issued’ market have been issued recently.Increase in Instruments in the Government Securities Market• 91-day Treasury bill was introduced for managing liquidity and benchmarking. ZeroCoupon Bonds, Floating Rate Bonds, Capital Indexed Bonds were issued and exchangetraded interest rate futures were introduced. OTC interest rate derivatives like IRS/ FRAswere introduced.• Outright sale of Central Government dated security that are not owned have beenpermitted, subject to the same being covered by outright purchase from the secondarymarket within the same trading day subject to certain conditions.• Repo status has been granted to State Government securities in order to improvesecondary market liquidity.Enabling Measures• Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were allowed to invest in government securitiessubject to certain limits.• Introduction of automated screen-based trading in government securities throughNegotiated Dealing System (NDS).• Setting up of risk-free payments and settlement system in government securities throughClearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL).• Phased introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS).• Introduction of trading in government securities on stock exchanges for promoting retailingin such securities, permitting non-banks to participate in repo market.• Recent measures include introduction of NDS-OM and T+1 settlement norms.As regards the foreign exchange market, reforms focused on market development withinbuilt prudential safeguards so that the market would not be destabilised in the process (Reddy,2002). The move towards a market-based exchange rate regime in 1993 and the subsequentadoption of current account convertibility were the key measures in reforming the Indian foreignexchange market. Banks are increasingly being given greater autonomy to undertake foreignexchange operations. In order to deepen the foreign exchange market, a large number of productshave been introduced and entry of new players has been allowed in the market (Box IV).Summing up, reforms were designed to enable the process of efficient price discovery andinduce greater internal efficiency in resource allocation within the banking system.  While the policymeasures in the pre-1990s period were essentially devoted to financial deepening, the focus of8reforms in the last decade and a half has been engendering greater efficiency and productivity inthe banking system.  Reforms in the monetary policy framework were aimed at providingoperational flexibility to the Reserve Bank in its conduct of monetary policy by relaxing theconstraint imposed by passive monetisation of the fisc.BOX IVREFORMS IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETExchange Rate Regime• Evolution of exchange rate regime from a single-currency fixed-exchange rate system tofixing the value of rupee against a basket of currencies and further to market-determinedfloating exchange rate regime.• Adoption of convertibility of rupee for current account transactions with acceptance ofArticle VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF.

Residents arepermitted to open such accounts within the general limit of US $ 25, 000 per year.III. Financial Sector and Monetary Policy Reforms: An AssessmentBanking SectorAn assessment of the banking sector shows that banks have experienced strong balancesheet growth in the post-reform period in an environment of operational flexibility. Improvement inthe financial health of banks, reflected in significant improvement in capital adequacy andimproved asset quality, is distinctly visible. It is noteworthy that this progress has been achieveddespite the adoption of international best practices in prudential norms. Competitiveness andproductivity gains have also been enabled by proactive technological deepening and flexiblehuman resource management. These significant gains have been achieved even while renewingour goals of social banking viz., maintaining the wide reach of the banking system and directingcredit towards important but disadvantaged sectors of society. A brief discussion on theperformance of the banking sector under the reform process is given below.Spread of BankingThe banking system's wide reach, judged in terms of expansion of branches and thegrowth of credit and deposits indicates continued financial deepening (Table 1). The populationper bank branch has not changed much since the 1980s, and has remained at around 16,000.9Table 1: Progress of Commercial Banking in India1969 1980 1991 1995 2000 20051 2 3 4 5 6 91 No. of Commercial Banks 73 154 272 284 298 2882 No. of Bank Offices 8,262 34,594 60,570 64,234 67,868 68,339Of whichRural and semi-urban bank 5,172 23,227 46,550 46,602 47,693 47491offices3 Population per Office (’000s) 64 16 14 15 15 164 Per capita Deposit (Rs.) 88 738 2,368 4,242 8,542 16,6995 Per capita Credit (Rs.) 68 457 1,434 2,320 4,555 10,1356 Priority Sector Advances@ 15 37 39 34 35 40(per cent)7 Deposits (per cent of National 16 36 48 48 54 65Income)Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaIn the post-reform period, banks have consistently maintained high rates of growth in theirassets and liabilities. On the liability side, deposits continue to account for about 80 per cent of thetotal liabilities. On the asset side, the shares of loans and advances on the one hand andinvestments on the other hand have seen marked cycles, reflecting banks' portfolio preferencesas well as growth cycles in the economy.  The share of loans and advances declined in thesecond half of 1990s responding to slowdown in investment demand as well as tightening ofprudential norms.  With investment demand again picking up in the past 3-4 years, banks' creditportfolio has witnessed sharp growth.  Banks' investment in gilts have accordingly seen asignificant decline in the past one year, although it still remains above the minimum statutoryrequirement. Thus, while in the 1990s, greater investments and aversion to credit risk exposuremay have deterred banks from undertaking their ‘core function’ of financial intermediation viz.,accepting deposits and extending credit, they seem to have struck a greater balance in recentyears between investments and loans and advances. The improved atmosphere for recoverycreated in the recent years seems to have induced banks to put greater efforts in extending loans.Capital Position and Asset QualitySince the beginning of reforms, a set of micro-prudential measures have been stipulatedaimed at imparting strength to the banking system as well as ensuring safety. With regard toprudential requirements, income recognition and asset classification (IRAC) norms have beenstrengthened to approach international best practice. Initially, while it was deemed to attain aCRAR of 8 per cent in a phased manner, it was subsequently raised to 9 per cent with effect from1999-2000.The overall capital position of commercial banks has witnessed a marked improvementduring the reform period (Table 2). Illustratively, as at end-March 2005, 86 out of the 88commercial banks operating in India maintained CRAR at or above 9 per cent. The correspondingfigure for 1995-96 was 54 out of 92 banks.  Improved capitalisation of public sector banks wasinitially brought through substantial infusion of funds by government to recapitalise these banks.Subsequently, in order to mitigate the budgetary impact and to introduce market discipline, publicsector banks were allowed to raise funds from the market through equity issuance subject to themaintenance of 51 per cent public ownership. Ownership in public sector banks is now welldiversified.  As at end-March 2005, the holding by the general public in six banks ranged between40 and 49 per cent and in 12 banks between 30 and 49 per cent.  It was only in four banks that theGovernment holding was more than 90 per cent.10Table 2: Distribution of Commercial Banks According toRisk-weighted Capital Adequacy(Number of banks)Year Below 4 Between Between Above Totalper cent 4-9 per cent* 9-10 per cent@ 10 per cent1 2 3 4 5 61995-96 8 9 33 42 922000-01 3 2 11 84 1002004-05 1 1 8 78 88* : Relates to 4-8 per cent before 1999-2000,@: Relates to 8-10 per cent before 1999-2000.Source: Reserve Bank of India.Despite tightening norms, there has been considerable improvement in the asset quality ofbanks. India transited to a 90-day NPL recognition norm (from 180-day norm) in 2004.Nonetheless, non-performing loans (NPLs), as ratios of both total advances and assets, havedeclined substantially and consistently since the mid-1990s (Table 3). Improvement in the creditappraisal process, upturn of the business cycle, new initiatives for resolution of NPLs (includingpromulgation of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement ofSecurity Interest (SARFAESI) Act), and greater provisioning and write-off of NPLs enabled bygreater profitability, have kept incremental NPLs low.

Notwithstanding such transformation, the public sector banks still account fornearly three-fourths of assets and income. Public sector banks have also responded to the newchallenges of competition, as reflected in their increased share in the overall profit of the bankingsector. This suggests that, with operational flexibility, public sector banks are competing relativelyeffectively with private sector and foreign banks. Public sector bank managements are nowprobably more attuned to the market consequences of their activities (Mohan, 2006a).  Shares ofIndian private sector banks, especially new private sector banks established in the 1990s, in thetotal income and assets of the banking system have improved considerably since the mid-1990s(Table 4). The reduction in the asset share of foreign banks, however, is partially due to theirincreased focus on off-balance sheet non-fund based business.11Table 4: Bank Group-wise Shares: Select Indicators(Per cent)1995-96 2000-012004-051 2 36Public Sector BanksIncome 82.5 78.4 75.6Expenditure 84.2 78.9 75.8Total Assets 84.4 79.5 74.4Net Profit -39.1 67.4 73.3Gross Profit 74.3 69.9 75.9New Private Sector BanksIncome 1.5 5.7 11.8Expenditure 1.3 5.5 11.4Total Assets 1.5 6.1 12.9Net Profit 17.8 10.0 15.0Gross Profit 2.5 6.9 10.7Foreign BanksIncome 9.4 9.1 7.0Expenditure 8.3 8.8 6.6Total Assets 7.9 7.9 6.8Net Profit 79.8 14.8 9.7Gross Profit 15.6 15.7 9.0Source: Reserve Bank of India.Efficiency gains are also reflected in containment of the operating expenditure as aproportion of total assets (Table 5). This has been achieved in spite of large expenditures incurredby Indian banks in installation and upgradation of information technology and, in the case of publicsector banks, large expenditures under voluntary pre-mature retirement of nearly 12 per cent oftheir total staff strength.12Table 5: Earnings and Expenses of Scheduled Commercial Banks(Rs. billion)Year Total Total Interest Total Interest Establishment NetAssets Earnings Earnings Expenses Expenses Expenses InterestEarning1 2 3 4 5 7 8 91969 68 4 4 4 2 1 2(6.2) (5.3) (5.5) (2.8) (2.1) (2.5)1980 582 42 38 42 27 10 10(7.3) (6.4) (7.2) (4.7) (1.7) (1.8)1991 3,275 304 275 297 190 76 86(9.3) (8.4) (9.1) (5.8) (2.3) (2.6)2000 11,055 1,149 992 1,077 690 276 301(10.4) (9.0) (9.7) (6.2) (2.5) (2.7)2005 22,746 1,867 1,531 1,660 866 491 665(8.2) (6.7) (7.3) (3.8) (2.2) (2.9)Note: Figures in brackets are ratios to total assets.Source: Reserve Bank of India.Improvements in efficiency of the banking system are also reflected, inter alia, in costs ofintermediation. which, defined as the ratio of operating expense to total assets, witnessed agradual reduction in the post reform period across various bank groups barring foreign banks(Table 6).  However, intermediation costs of banks in India still tend to be higher than those indeveloped countries. Similarly, the cost income-ratio (defined as the ratio of operating expenses tototal income less interest expense) of Indian banks has shown a declining trend during the postreform period. For example, Indian banks paid roughly 45 per cent of their net income towardsmanaging labour and physical capital in 2004 as against nearly 72 per cent in 1993 (Mohan,2006a). Indian banks thus recorded a net cost saving of nearly 27 per cent of their net incomeduring the post reform period.*Table 6: Intermediation Cost of Scheduled Commercial Banks:1996-2005(as percentage to total asset)Year Public Sector New Private Foreign All Scheduled(end-March) Banks Banks Banks CommercialBanks1 2 3 4 51996 2.99 1.82 2.78 2.941997 2.88 1.94 3.04 2.851998 2.66 1.76 2.99 2.631999 2.65 1.74 3.40 2.652000 2.52 1.42 3.12 2.482001 2.72 1.75 3.05 2.642002 2.29 1.12 3.03 2.192003 2.25 1.95 2.79 2.242004 2.20 2.02 2.76 2.202005 2.03 2.06 2.85 2.09* Intermediation cost = operating expenses.Source: Computed from Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India, RBI, variousyearsProductivityWhat is most encouraging is the very significant improvement in the productivity of theIndian banking system, in terms of various productivity indicators.  The business per employee ofIndian banks increased over three-fold in real terms from Rs.5.4 million in 1992 to Rs.17.3 millionin 2005, exhibiting an annual compound growth rate of more than 9 per cent (Table 7). The profitper employee increased from Rs.20,000 to Rs. 130,000 over the same period, implying acompound growth of around 15.5 per cent. Branch productivity also recorded concomitantimprovements. These improvements could be driven by two factors: technological improvement,which expands the range of production possibilities and a catching up effect, as peer pressure13amongst banks compels them to raise productivity levels. Here, the role of new business practices,new approaches and expansion of the business that was introduced by the new private banks hasbeen of the utmost importance.Table 7: Select Productivity Indicators of Scheduled Commercial Banks   (Rs. million at 1993-94 prices)Year Business per Profit Business peremployee per employee branch1 2 3 41992 5.4 0.02 109.91996 6.0 0.01 119.62000 9.7 0.05 179.42005 17.3 0.13 267.0Source: Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India.Monetary PolicyWhat has been the impact of the monetary policy? From the innumerable dimensions ofimpact of monetary policy, let me focus on some select elements.InflationTurning to an assessment of monetary policy, it would be reasonable to assert thatmonetary policy has been largely successful in meeting its key objectives in the post-reformsperiod. Just as the late 1990s witnessed a fall in inflation worldwide, so too has India.  Inflation hasaveraged close to five per cent per annum in the decade gone by, notably lower than that of eightper cent in the previous four decades (Chart 1).  Structural reforms since the early 1990s coupledwith improved monetary-fiscal interface and reforms in the Government securities market enabledbetter monetary management from the second half of the 1990s onwards. More importantly, theregime of low and stable inflation has, in turn, stabilised inflation expectations and inflationtolerance in the economy has come down. It is encouraging to note that despite record highinternational crude oil prices, inflation remains low and inflation expectations also remain stable.Since inflation expectations are a key determinant of the actual inflation outcome, and given thelags in monetary transmission, we have been taking pre-emptive measures to keep inflation2expectations stable. As discussed further below, a number of instruments, both existing as well asnew, were employed to modulate liquidity conditions to achieve the desired objectives. A numberof other factors such as increased competition, productivity gains and strong corporate balancesheets have also contributed to this low and stable inflation environment, but it appears thatcalibrated monetary measures had a substantial role to play as well.                                                          2 The Reserve Bank has raised its key policy rate – the reverse repo rate in phases – by 100 basis points sinceOctober 2004.14Chart 1 : Wholesale Price Inflation in India302520151050-5WPI Inflation 5-Year Moving AverageChallenges posed by large capital inflowsIt is pertinent to note that inflation could be contained since the mid-1990s, despitechallenges posed by large capital flows. Following the reforms in the external sector, foreigninvestment flows have been encouraged. Reflecting the strong growth prospects of the Indianeconomy, the country has received large investment inflows, both direct and portfolio, since 1993-94 as compared with negligible levels till the early 1990s. Total foreign investment flows (directand portfolio) increased from US$ 111 million in 1990-91 to US$ 17,496 million in 2005-06 (April-February).  Over the same period, current account deficits remained modest – averaging one percent of GDP since 1991-92 and in fact recorded small surpluses during 2001-04. With capitalflows remaining in excess of the current financing requirements, the overall balance of paymentsrecorded persistent surpluses leading to an increase in reserves. Despite such large accretion toreserves, inflation could be contained reflecting appropriate policy responses by the ReserveBank and the Government.The emergence of foreign exchange surplus lending to continuing and large accretion toreserves since the mid 1990s has been a novel experience for India after experiencing chronicbalance of payment problems for almost four decades.  These surpluses began to arise after theopening of the current account, reduction in trade protection, and partial opening of the capitalaccount from the early to mid 1990s.   The exchange rate flexibility practiced since 1992-93 hasbeen an important part of the policy response needed to manage capital flows.The composition of India's balance of payments has undergone significant change sincethe mid 1990s.  In the current account, the growth of software exports and, more recently, ofbusiness process outsourcing, has increased the share of service exports on a continuing basis.Even more significant is the growth in remittances from non-resident Indians (NRIs), nowamounting to about 3 per cent of GDP.   The latter exhibit a great deal of stability.   Theremittances appear to consist mainly of maintenance flows that do not seem to be affected byexchange rate, inflation, or growth rate changes.  Thus, the Indian current account exhibits only asmall deficit, or a surplus, despite the existence of merchandise trade deficit that has grown from3.2 per cent of GDP in the mid 1990s to 5.3 per cent in 2004-05.   On the capital account, unlikeother emerging markets, portfolio flows have far exceeded foreign direct investment in India inrecent years.   Coupled with other capital flows consisting of official and commercial debt, NRIdeposits, and other banking capital, net capital flows now amount to about 4.4 per cent of GDP.The downturn in the Indian business cycle during the early part of this decade led to theemergence of a current account surplus, particularly because the existence of the relativeexchange rate insensitive remittance flows.   Consequently, foreign exchange reserves grew bymore than US $ 120 billion between April 2000 and April 2006.The management of these flows involved a mix of policy responses that had to keep aneye on the level of reserves, monetary policy objectives related to the interest rate, liquidity15Per cent197119731975197719791981198319851987198919911993199519971999200120032005management, and maintenance of healthy financial market conditions with financial stability.Decisions to do with sterilisation involve judgements on the character of the excess forex flows:are they durable, semi-durable or transitory.  This judgement itself depends on assessmentsabout both the real economy and of financial sector developments.  Moreover, at any given time,some flows could be of an enduring nature whereas others could be of short term, and hencereversible.On an operational basis, sterilisation operations through open market operations (OMOs)should take care of durable flows, whereas transitory flows can be managed through the normaldaily operations of the LAF.By 2003-04, sterilisation operations, however, started appearing to be constrained by thefinite stock of Government securities held by the Reserve Bank.  The legal restrictions on theReserve Bank on issuing its own paper also placed constraints on future sterilisation operations.Accordingly, an innovative scheme in the form of Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) wasintroduced in April 2004 wherein Government of India dated securities/Treasury Bills are beingissued to absorb enduring surplus liquidity. These dated securities/Treasury Bills are the same asthose issued for normal market borrowings and this avoids segmentation of the market. Moreover,the MSS scheme brings transparency in regard to costs associated with sterilisation operations.Hitherto, the costs of sterilisation were fully borne by the Reserve Bank in the first instance and itsimpact was transmitted to the Government in the form of lower profit transfers. With theintroduction of the MSS, the cost in terms of interest payments would be borne by the Governmentitself in a transparent manner.It is relevant to note that the MSS has provided the Reserve Bank the flexibility to not onlyabsorb liquidity but also to inject liquidity in case of need. This was evident during the second halfof 2005-06 when liquidity conditions became tight in view of strong credit demand, increase inGovernment’s surplus with the Reserve Bank and outflows on account of bullet redemption of IndiaMillennium Deposits (about US $ 7 billion). In view of these circumstances, fresh issuances underthe MSS were suspended between November 2005 and April 2006. Redemptions ofsecurities/Treasury Bills issued earlier – along with active management of liquidity throughrepo/reverse repo operations under Liquidity Adjustment Facility - provided liquidity to the marketand imparted stability to financial markets (Chart 2). With liquidity conditions improving, it wasdecided to again start issuing securities under the MSS from May 2006 onwards. The issuance ofsecurities under the MSS has thus enabled the Reserve Bank to improve liquidity management inthe system, to maintain stability in the foreign exchange market and to conduct monetary policy inaccordance with the stated objectives.Chart 2 : Liquidity Management140,000120,000100,00080,00060,00040,00020,0000-20,000-40,000LAF MSS Centre's Surplus with the RBIThe Indian experience highlights the need for emerging market economies to allow greaterflexibility in exchange rates but the authorities can also benefit from having the capacity tointervene in foreign exchange markets in view of the volatility observed in international capitalflows. A key lesson is that flexibility and pragmatism are required in the management of theexchange rate and monetary policy in developing countries, rather than adherence to stricttheoretical rules.Three overarching features marked the transition of India to an open economy. First, theadministered exchange rate became market determined and ensuring orderly conditions in the16Rupees croreApr-04Jun-04Aug-04Oct-04Dec-04Feb-05Apr-05Jun-05Aug-05Oct-05Dec-05Feb-06Apr-06foreign exchange market became an objective of exchange rate management. Second, as alreadyindicated, vicissitudes in capital flows came to influence the conduct of monetary policy. Third,lessons of the balance of payments crisis highlighted the need to maintain an adequate level offoreign exchange reserves and this in turn both enabled and constrained the conduct of monetarypolicy. From hindsight, it appears that the strategy paid off with the exchange rate exhibitingreasonable two-way movement (Chart 3).Chart 3 : Exchange Rate50 1104810546100444295409038368534803230 75Rupees per US dollarREER (36-currency weight, trade-based) (right scale)NEER (36-currency weight, trade-based) (right scale)Credit DeliveryGiven that the Indian financial system is still predominantly bank based, bank creditcontinues to be of great importance for funding different sectors of the economy.   Consequent toderegulation of interest rates and substantial reduction in statutory pre-emptions, there was anexpectation that credit flow would be correspondingly enhanced.  In the event, banks continued toshow a marked preference for investments in government securities with no reduction in theproportion of their assets being held in investments in government securities, until recently, whencredit growth picked up in 2003-04.   With the shift in approach from micro management of creditthrough various regulations, credit allocation targets, and administered interest rates, to a riskbased system of lending and market determined interest rates, banks have to developappropriate credit risk assessment techniques.   Apart from promoting healthy credit growth, thisis also critical for the efficiency of monetary management in view of the move to use of indirectinstruments in monetary management.The stagnation in credit flow observed during the late 1990s, in retrospect, was partlycaused by reduction in demand on account of increase in real interest rates, turn down in thebusiness cycle, and the significant business restructuring that occurred during that period.  Asharp recovery has now taken place.The stagnation during the 1990s has seen a sharp recovery in the past few years. Thecredit-GDP ratio, after moving in a narrow range of around 30 per cent between the mid-1980s andlate 1990s, started increasing from 2000-01 onwards (Chart 4). It increased from 30 per centduring 1999-00 to 41 per cent during 2004-05 and further to 48 per cent during 2005-06. However,sharp growth of credit in the past couple of years has also led to some areas of policy concern anddilemmas, as discussed later.17Rupees per US dollarApr-93Apr-94Apr-95Apr-96Apr-97Apr-98Apr-99Apr-00Apr-01Apr-02Apr-03Apr-04Apr-05Index (1993-94=100)Chart 4: Credit-GDP Ratio504540353025201510How did the monetary policy support the growth momentum in the economy? As inflation,along with inflation expectations, fell during the earlier period of this decade, policy interest rateswere also brought down.  Consequently, both nominal and real interest rates fell.  The growth ratein interest expenses of the corporates declined consistently since 1995-96, from 25.0 per cent to anegative of 11.5 per cent in 2003-04 (Table 8). Such decline in interest costs has significantimplications for the improvement in bottom lines of the corporates. Various indicators pertaining tointerest costs, which can throw light on the impact of interest costs on corporate sector profits haveturned positive in recent years.Table 8: Monetary Policy and Corporate Performance:Interest Rate Related IndicatorsYear Growth Rate in Interest Debt Service to Interest Coverage RatioExpenses (%) Total uses of Funds (ICR) #1990-91 16.2 22.4 2.81991-92 28.7 28.3 2.71992-93 21.6 24.4 2.41993-94 3.1 20.9 2.91994-95 8.1 27.2 3.51995-96 25.0 21.5 3.61996-97 25.7 18.7 2.91997-98 12.5 8.1 2.81998-99 11.1 17.6 2.61999-00 6.7 17.6 2.82000-01 7.1 14.0 2.82001-02 -2.7 19.4 2.72002-03 -11.2 8.9 3.72003-04 -11.5 14.1 4.9Note: This is based on a sample of non-government non-financial public limited companiedcollected by the RBI.# ICR is defined as earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITD) over interestexpenses.18Per cent1970-711972-731974-751976-771978-791980-811982-831984-851986-871988-891990-911992-931994-951996-971998-992000-012002-032004-05IV. Some Emerging IssuesThis review of financial sector reforms and monetary policy has documented the calibratedand coordinated reforms that have been undertaken in India since the 1990s.  In terms ofoutcomes, this strategy has achieved the broad objectives of price stability along with reducedmedium and long term inflation expectations; the installation of an institutional framework andpolicy reform promoting relatively efficient price discovery of interest rates and the exchange rate;phased introduction of competition in banking along with corresponding improvements inregulation and supervision approaching international best practice, which has led to notableimprovement in banking performance and financials.  The implementation of these reforms hasalso involved the setting up or improvement of key financial infrastructure such as payment andsettlement systems, and clearing and settlement systems for debt and forex market functioning.All of this financial development has been achieved with the maintenance of a great degree offinancial stability, along with overall movement of the economy towards a higher growth path.With increased deregulation of financial markets and increased integration of the globaleconomy, the 1990s were turbulent for global financial markets: 63 countries suffered fromsystemic banking crises in that decade, much higher than 45 in the 1980s.  Among countries thatexperienced such crises, the direct cost of reconstructing the financial system was typically veryhigh: for example, recapitalisation of banks had cost 55 per cent of GDP in Argentina, 42 per centin Thailand, 35 per cent in Korea and 10 per cent in Turkey.   There were high indirect costs of lostopportunities and slow economic growth in addition (McKinsey & Co., 2005).  It is thereforeparticularly noteworthy that India could pursue its process of financial deregulation and opening ofthe economy without suffering financial crises during this turbulent period in world financialmarkets.  The cost of recapitalisation of public sector banks at less than 1 per cent of GDP istherefore low in comparison.  Whereas we can be legitimately gratified with this performancerecord, we now need to focus on the new issues that need to be addressed for the next phase offinancial development.That current annual GDP growth of around 8 per cent can be achieved in India at an about30 per cent rate of gross domestic investment suggests that the economy is functioning quiteefficiently.  We need to ensure that we maintain this level of efficiency and attempt to improve on itfurther.  As the Indian economy continues on such a growth path and attempts to accelerate it,new demands are being placed on the financial system.Growth Challenges for the Financial SectorHigher sustained growth is contributing to the movement of large numbers of householdsinto ever higher income categories, and hence higher consumption categories, along withenhanced demand for financial savings opportunities.  In rural areas in particular, there alsoappears to be increasing diversification of productive opportunities.   Thus, the banking system hasto extend itself and innovate to respond to these new demands for both consumption andproduction purposes.   This is particularly important since banking penetration is still low in India:there are only about 10-12 ATMs in India per million population, as compared with over 50 inChina, 170 in Thailand, and 500 in Korea.  Moreover, the deposit to GDP ratio or the loans/GDPratio is also low compared to other Asian countries (McKinsey & Co., 2005).On the production side, industrial expansion has accelerated; merchandise trade growth ishigh; and there are vast demands for infrastructure investment, from the public sector, privatesector and through public private partnerships.  Furthermore, it is the service sector that hasexhibited consistently high growth rates: the hospitality industry, shopping malls, entertainmentindustry, medical facilities, and the like, are all expanding fast.  Thus a great degree ofdiversification is taking place in the economy and the banking system has to respond adequatelyto these new challenges, opportunities and risks.In dealing with these new consumer demands and production demands of ruralenterprises and of SME's in urban areas, banks have to innovate and look for new deliverymechanisms that economise on transaction costs and provide better access to the currently under-served. Innovative channels for credit delivery for serving these new rural credit needs,encompassing full supply chain financing, covering storage, warehousing, processing, andtransportation from farm to market will have to be found.   The budding expansion of non-agriculture service enterprises in rural areas will have to be financed to generate new income andemployment opportunities.  Greater efforts will need to be made on information technology forrecord keeping, service delivery, reduction in transactions costs, risk assessment and riskmanagement.  Banks will have to invest in new skills through new recruitment and throughintensive training of existing personnel.19It is the public sector banks that have the large and widespread reach, and hence have thepotential for contributing effectively to achieve financial inclusion.   But it is also they who face themost difficult challenges in human resource development.  They will have to invest very heavily inskill enhancement at all levels: at the top level for new strategic goal setting; at the middle level forimplementing these goals; and at the cutting edge lower levels for delivering the new servicemodes.  Given the current age composition of employees in these banks, they will also face newrecruitment challenges in the face of adverse compensation structures in comparison with the freerprivate sector.  Meanwhile, the new private sector banks will themselves have to innovate andaccelerate their reach into the emerging low income and rural market segments.   They have theindependence and flexibility to find the new business models necessary for serving thesesegments.A number of policy initiatives are underway to aid this overall process of financial inclusionand increase in banking penetration.  The Parliament has passed the Credit Information BureauAct that will enable the setting up of credit information bureaus through the mandatory sharing ofinformation by banks.  The Reserve Bank is in the process of issuing guidelines for the formationof these bureaus.  As this process gathers force, it should contribute greatly in reducing the costsof credit quality assessment.   Second, considerable work is in process for promoting micro-finance in the country, including the consideration of possible legislation for regulation of micro-finance institutions.  Third, the Reserve Bank has issued guidelines to banks enabling theoutsourcing of certain functions including the use of agencies such as post offices for achievingbetter outreach.  These are all efforts in the right direction, but much more needs to be done toreally achieve financial inclusion in India.The challenges that are emerging are right across the size spectrum of business activities.On the one hand, the largest firms are attaining economic sizes such that they are reaching theprudential exposure limits of banks, even though they are still small relative to the large globalMNCs.  On the other hand, with changes in technology, there is new activity at the small andmedium level in all spheres of activity.   To cope with the former, the largest Indian banks have tobe encouraged to expand fast, both through organic growth and through consolidation; and thecorporate debt market has to be developed to enable further direct recourse to financial marketsfor the largest firms.   For serving and contributing to the growth of firms at the lower end, bankshave to strengthen their risk assessment systems, along with better risk management.   Fundingnew entrepreneurs and activities is a fundamentally risky business because of the lack of aprevious record and inadequate availability of collateral, but it is the job of banks to take such risk,but in a measured fashion.  Given the history of public sector banks outlined earlier, such a changein approach requires a change in mind set, but also focused training in risk assessment, riskmanagement, and marketing.Various policy measures are in process to help this transition along.  The Reserve Bankissued new guidelines in 2004 on "Ownership and Governance in Private Sector Banks".    Theseguidelines have increased the minimum capital for private sector banks to Rs.3 billion; providedenhanced guidance on the fit and proper nature of owners, board members and top managementof these banks; and placed limitations on the extent of dominant shareholdings.   These measuresare designed to promote the healthy growth of private sector banks and along with better corporategovernance as they assume greater weight in the economy.   An issue of relevance here is that offinancial stability.  To a certain extent, the predominance of government owned banks hascontributed to financial stability in the country.   Experience has shown that even the deteriorationin bank financials does not lead to erosion of consumer confidence in such banks.  This kind ofconsumer confidence does not extend to private sector banks.  Hence, as they gain in size andshare, capital enhancement and sound corporate governance become essential for financialstability.  Second, the lending ability of banks has been potentially constrained by the existingprovisions for statutory pre-emption of funds for investment in government securities.   A bill hasbeen introduced in Parliament to amend the existing Banking Regulation Act to eliminate theminimum 25 per cent limit of investment in government securities.   As the fiscal situation improvesconsistent with the FRBM Act, it will then be possible to reduce the statutory pre-emption, enablinggreater fund flow to the private sector for growth.  Third, the bill also provides for raising of capitalthrough BASEL II consistent innovative instruments, enabling the capital expansion of banksneeded for their growth.Greater Capital Market Openness: Some IssuesAn important feature of the Indian financial reform process has been the calibratedopening of the capital account along with current account convertibility.   The Government and theReserve Bank have already appointed a Committee to advise on a roadmap for fuller capitalaccount convertibility.   Decisions on further steps will be taken after that committee submits its20report in a couple of months.  Meanwhile, we can note some of the issues that will need attentionas we achieve fuller capital account openness.A key component of Indian capital account management has been the management ofvolatility in the forex market, and of its consequential impact on the money market and hence onmonetary operations guided by the extant monetary policy objectives. This has been done, asoutlined, through a combination of forex market intervention, domestic liquidity management, andadministrative instructions on regulating external debt in different forms.   Correspondingly,progress has been made on the functioning of the government securities market, forex market andmoney market and their progressive integration.  Particular attention has been given to theexposure of financial intermediaries to foreign exchange liabilities, and of the government in theirborrowing programme.   So far, some degree of success has been achieved in that the exchangerate responds to the supply demand conditions in the market and exhibits two way flexibility; theinterest rate is similarly flexible and market determined; healthy growth has taken place in trade inboth goods and services; and inward capital flows have been healthy.We have to recognise that fuller capital account openness will lead to a confrontation withthe impossible trinity of simultaneous attainment of independent monetary policy, open capitalaccount, and managed exchange rate.  At best, only two out of the three would be feasible.   Witha more open capital account as a `given' and if a choice is made of an `anchor' role for monetarypolicy, exchange rate management will be affected.  A freely floating exchange rate should, in fact,engender the independence of monetary policy.  It needs to be recognised, however, that theimpact of exchange rate changes on the real sector is significantly different for reserve currencycountries and for developing countries like India.  For the former which specialise in technologyintensive products the degree of exchange rate pass through is low, enabling exporters andimporters to ignore temporary shocks and set stable product prices to maintain monopolisticpositions, despite large currency fluctuations.  Moreover, mature and well developed financialmarkets in these countries, have absorbed the risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations withnegligible spillover on the real activity.  On the other hand, for the majority of developing countrieswhich specialise in labour-intensive and low and intermediate technology products, profit marginsin the intensely competitive markets for these products are very thin and vulnerable to pricingpower by large retail chains.  Consequently, exchange rate volatility has significant employment,output and distributional consequences (Mohan, 2004a; 2005).  In this context, managingexchange rate volatility would continue to be an issue requiring attention.A further challenge for policy in the context of fuller capital account opennes will be topreserve the financial stability of different markets as greater deregulation is done on capitaloutflows and on debt inflows.  The vulnerability of financial intermediaries can perhaps beaddressed through prudential regulations and their supervision; risk management of non-financialentities will have to be through further developments in both the corporate debt market and theforex market, which enable them to manage their risks through the use of newer marketinstruments.   This will require market development, enhancement of regulatory capacity in theseareas, as well as human resource development in both financial intermediaries and non-financialentities.  Given the volatility of capital flows, it remains to be seen whether financial marketdevelopment in a country like India can be such that this volatility does not result in unacceptabledisruption in exchange rate determination with inevitable real sector consequences, and indomestic monetary conditions.  If not, what will be the kind of market interventions that willcontinue to be needed and how effective will they be?Another aspect of greater capital market openness concerns the presence of foreignbanks in India.  The Government and Reserve Bank outlined a roadmap on foreign investment inbanks in India in February 2005, which provides guidelines on the extent of their presence until2009.   This roadmap is consistent with the overall guidelines issued simultaneously on ownershipand governance in private sector banks in India.  The presence of foreign banks in the country hasbeen very useful in bringing greater competition in certain segments in the market.   They aresignificant participants in investment banking and in development of the forex market.   With thechanges that have taken place in the United States and other countries, where the traditionalbarriers between banking, insurance and securities companies have been removed, the size of thelargest financial conglomerates has become extremely large.  Between 1995 and 2004, the size ofthe largest bank in the world has grown  three-fold  by  asset  size,  from about US $ 0.5 trillion toUS $ 1.5 trillion, almost double the size of Indian GDP.   This has happened through a greatdegree of merger activity: for example, J.P.Morgan Chase is the result of mergers among 550banks and financial institutions.   The ten biggest commercial banks in the US now control almosthalf of that country's banking assets, up from 29 per cent just 10 years ago (Economist, 2006).Hence, with fuller capital account convertibility and greater presence of foreign banks over time, anumber of issues will arise.  First, if these large global banks have emerged as a result of realeconomies of scale and scope, how will smaller national banks compete in countries like India, and21will they themselves need to generate a larger international presence?  Second, there isconsiderable discussion today on overlaps and potential conflicts between home countryregulators of foreign banks and host country regulators: how will these be addressed and resolvedin the years to come?  Third, given that operations in one country such as India are typically smallrelative to the global operations of these large banks, the attention of top management devoted toany particular country is typically low. Consequently, any market or regulatory transgressionscommitted in one country by such a bank, which may have a significant impact on banking orfinancial market of that country, is likely to have negligible impact on the bank's global operations.It has been seen in recent years that even relatively strong regulatory action taken by regulatorsagainst such global banks has had negligible market or reputational impact on them in terms oftheir stock price or similar metrics.  Thus, there is loss of regulatory effectiveness as a result of thepresence of such financial conglomerates.  Hence there is inevitable tension between the benefitsthat such global conglomerates bring and some regulatory and market structure and competitionissues that may arise.Along with the emergence of international financial conglomerates we are also witnessingsimilar growth of Indian conglomerates.   As in most countries, the banking, insurance andsecurities companies each come under the jurisdiction of their respective regulators.   A beginninghas been made in organized cooperation between the regulators on the regulation of suchconglomerates, with agreement on who would be the lead regulator in each case.  In the UnitedStates, it is a financial holding company that is at the core of each conglomerate, with eachcompany being its subsidiary.  There is, as yet, no commonality in the financial structure of eachconglomerate in India: in some the parent company is the banking company; whereas in othersthere is a mix of structure.   For Indian conglomerates to be competitive, and for them to grow to asemblance of international size, they will need continued improvement in clarity in regulatoryapproach.As the country's financial system faces each of these challenges in the coming years, wewill also need to adapt monetary policy to the imperatives brought by higher growth and greateropenness of the economy.High Credit Growth and Monetary PolicyHigh and sustained growth of the economy in conjunction with low inflation is the centralconcern of monetary policy in India. As noted above, we have been reasonably successful inmeeting these objectives. In this context, one issue still remains: whether monetary policy shouldhave only price stability as its sole objective, as suggested by proponents of inflation targeting.Several central banks, such as, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of NewZealand, have adopted explicit inflation targets.  Others, whose credibility in fighting inflation islong established (notably, the US Federal Reserve), do not set explicit annual inflation targets.Central banks are thus clearly divided on the advisability of setting explicit inflation targets. In viewof the difficulties encountered with monetary targeting and exchange rate pegged regimes, anumber of central banks including some in emerging economies have adopted inflation targeting3frameworks.The simple principle of inflation targeting thus is also not so simple and poses problems formonetary policy making in developing countries. Moreover, concentrating only on numericalinflation objectives may reduce the flexibility of monetary policy, especially with respect to otherpolicy goals, particularly that of growth.In India, we have not favoured the adoption of inflation targeting, while keeping theattainment of low inflation as a central objective of monetary policy, along with that of high andsustained growth that is so important for a developing economy. Apart from the legitimate concernregarding growth as a key objective, there are other factors that suggest that inflation targetingmay not be appropriate for India. First, unlike many other developing countries we have had arecord of moderate inflation, with double digit inflation being the exception, and which is largelysocially unacceptable.  Second, adoption of inflation targeting requires the existence of an efficientmonetary transmission mechanism through the operation of efficient financial markets andabsence of interest rate distortions. In India, although the money market, government debt andforex market have indeed developed in recent years, they still have some way to go, whereas thecorporate debt market is still to develop. Though interest rate deregulation has largely beenaccomplished, some administered interest rates still persist. Third, inflationary pressures still oftenemanate from significant supply shocks related to the effect of the monsoon on agriculture, wheremonetary policy action may have little role. Finally, in an economy as large as that of India, withvarious regional differences, and continued existence of market imperfections in factor and product                                                          3 Although these inflation targeting countries were able to reduce inflation or maintain low inflation duringthe 1990s, stylised evidence shows that even non-IT countries were successful in this endeavour.22markets between regions, the choice of a universally acceptable measure of inflation is alsodifficult.A contemporary issue in central banking is the appropriate response of monetary policy tosharp asset price movements, that may accompany high corporate growth. In an era of pricestability and well-anchored inflation expectations, imbalances in the economy need not show upimmediately in overt inflation. Increased central bank credibility is a double-edged sword as itmakes it more likely that unsustainable booms could take longer to show up in overt inflation. Forinstance, unsustainable asset prices artificially boost accounting profits of corporates and therebymitigate the need for price increases; similarly, large financial gains by employees can partlysubstitute for higher wage claims. In an upturn of the business cycle, self-reinforcing processesdevelop, characterised by rising asset prices and loosening external financial constraints.'Irrational exuberance' can drive asset prices to unrealistic levels, even as the prices of currentlytraded goods and services exhibit few signs of inflation (Crockett, 2001). These forces operate inreverse in the contraction phase. In the upswing of the business cycle, financial imbalances,therefore, get built-up. There is, thus, a 'paradox of credibility' (Borio and White, 2003). In view ofthese developments, it is felt that credit and monetary aggregates – which are being ignored bymany central banks in view of the perceived instability of money demand - need to be monitoredclosely since sharp growth in these aggregates is a useful indicator of future instability.In India, like other countries, we have also seen large rallies in asset prices.Concomitantly, credit to the private sector has exhibited sharp growth in the past two years –averaging almost 30 per cent per annum. While the credit growth has been broad-based, credit tothe retail sector is emerging as a new avenue of deployment for the banking sector led byindividual housing loans. To illustrate, the share of housing in incremental bank credit hasincreased from 2.9 per cent in 1995-96 to 11.1 per cent in 2004-05, while the share of industry4went down from 64.9 per cent in 1995-96 to 25.6 per cent in 2004-05. Data for retail credit is notavailable prior to 1998-99; its share too has increased from 19.4 per cent in 1998-99 to 24.3 percent in 2004-05.  Nonetheless, in the light of high credit growth, there is a need to ensure that asset qualityis maintained. Since growth in credit was relatively higher in a few sectors such as retail credit andreal commercial estate, monetary policy faces a dilemma in terms of instruments. An increase inpolicy rate across the board could adversely affect even the productive sectors of the economysuch as industry and agriculture. While policy rates have indeed been raised, they have beenmainly aimed at reining in inflation expectations in view of continuing pressures from high andvolatile crude oil prices. Therefore, while ensuring that credit demand for the productive sectors ofthe economy is met, the Reserve Bank has resorted to prudential measures in order to engineer a‘calibrated’ deceleration in the overall growth of credit to the commercial sector. Accordingly, theReserve Bank has raised risk weights on loans to these sectors. It also more than doubledprovisioning requirements on standard loans for the specific sectors from 0.4 per cent to 1.0 percent. Thus, the basic objective has been to ensure that the growth process is facilitated whileensuring price and financial stability in the economy.It is in this context, and consistent with the multiple indicator approach adopted by theReserve Bank, that monetary policy in India has consistently emphasised the need to be watchfulabout indications of rising aggregate demand embedded in consumer and business confidence,asset prices, corporate performance, the sizeable growth of reserve money and money supply, therising trade and current account deficits and, in particular, the quality of credit growth. Inretrospect, this risk sensitive approach has served us well in containing aggregate demandpressures and second round effects to an extent. It has also ensured that constant vigil ismaintained on threats to financial stability through a period when inflation was on the upturn andasset prices, especially in housing and real estate, are emerging as a challenge to monetaryauthorities worldwide. Significantly, it has also reinforced the growth momentum in the economy. Itis noteworthy that the cyclical expansion in bank credit has extended over an unprecedented 30months without encountering any destabilising volatility but this situation warrants enhancedvigilance.V. Concluding ObservationsTo conclude, the financial system in India, through a measured, gradual, cautious, andsteady process, has undergone substantial transformation. It has been transformed into areasonably sophisticated, diverse and resilient system through well-sequenced and coordinatedpolicy measures aimed at making the Indian financial sector more competitive, efficient, andstable. Concomitantly, effective monetary management has enabled price stability while ensuringavailability of credit to support investment demand and growth in the economy. Finally, the multi-                                                          4 This is exclusive of small housing loans provided within the priority sector lending.23pronged approach towards managing capital account in conjunction with prudential and cautiousapproach to financial liberalisation has ensured financial stability in contrast to the experience ofmany developing and emerging economies. This is despite the fact that we faced a large numberof shocks, both global and domestic. Monetary policy and financial sector reforms in India had tobe fine tuned to meet the challenges emanating from all these shocks. Viewed in this light, thesuccess in maintaining price and financial stability is all the more creditworthy.As the economy ascends a higher growth path, and as it is subjected to greater openingand financial integration with the rest of the world, the financial sector in all its aspects will needfurther considerable development, along with corresponding measures to continue regulatorymodernization and strengthening.  The overall objective of maintaining price stability in the contextof economic growth and financial stability will remain.ReferencesAhluwalia, M. S.
