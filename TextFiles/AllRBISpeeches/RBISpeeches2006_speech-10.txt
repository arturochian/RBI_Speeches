ECONOMIC GROWTH, FINANCIAL DEEPENINGAND FINANCIAL INCLUSION*Rakesh MohanI. IntroductionI would like to thank the Indian Banks Association and the Andhra Bank for invitingme to this Conference, which has become an annual feature of the calendar for bankers andfinancial sector professionals.In view of the theme of the conference, viz., "Inclusive Growth – A New Challenge",I thought it would be appropriate to place financial inclusion within the broad context ofeconomic growth. There is yet another motivation for choosing the theme. What is the bigchange that has taken place in India since 2004? The Indian growth story has been steadilycoming of age and the performance of the Indian economy has attracted worldwide attention.The Indian growth story is now mentioned in the same breath as that of China.  The economyhas been averaging a growth rate of more than 8.0 per cent during the last three years. Therecently released numbers from CSO have placed the first quarter growth (April to June,2006) at 8.9 per cent, more than  the overall growth rate of 8.0 per cent reiterated recently bythe Reserve Bank in its Mid-Term Review.On an earlier occasion in this forum, in its earlier avatar as BECON in December2002, I had noted the slow growth of credit and taken to task that audience of bankers as ‘lazybankers’ (Mohan, 2002).  Fortunately, you seem to have taken this observation seriously andnon-food credit growth from 2002-03 to 2005-06 averaged 28.8 per cent.  This growth showslittle sign of abating in the current year when it has recorded a growth of over 30.0 percent.The growth in broad money since 2002-03 has averaged 16.2 per cent, which during thepresent year has been of the order of 19.0 per cent. These trends signal further that India is ona high economic growth path accompanied by financial deepening.A new concern has emerged in the process: that of financial inclusion. Moreover, theGovernment of India has also expressed its explicit concern on the issue of overall inclusionin the development process through its various initiatives such as the Rural EmploymentGuarantee Scheme, the Bharat Nirman programme, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and the like.A committee on financial inclusion (Chairman: Dr. C. Rangarajan) has also been constitutedby the Government of India in June 2006 to recommend a strategy to achieve higher financialinclusion in the country.Likewise, enabling access to a greater number of the population to the structured andorganised financial system has explicitly been on the agenda of the Reserve Bank since 2004.Unlike several central banks, which focus solely on inflation, many developed and emergingeconomies, including ours, focus also on growth. There is currently a clear perception thatthere are a vast number of people, potential entrepreneurs, small enterprises and others, whoare excluded from the financial sector, which leads to their marginalisation and denial ofopportunity for them to grow and prosper. The Reserve Bank has therefore introduced variousnew measures to encourage the expansion of financial coverage in the country. Not only isfinancial inclusion essential because of its implications for the welfare of citizens but it needsto be stressed that it has to be an explicit strategy for fostering faster economic growth in a                                                (* Address by Dr. Rakesh Mohan at the Annual Bankers' Conference 2006, at Hyderabad on Nov 3,2006. This draws heavily on my earlier lecture on a similar subject at the FICCI-IBA Conference inMumbai on Sep 26, 2006) The assistance of Charan Singh, A. P. Gaur, Supriyo Majumdar, SaibalGhosh and Partha Ray in preparing the paper is gratefully acknowledged.more inclusive fashion. It is in this context that I thought it would be appropriate to place thestrategy of financial inclusion in the wider context of economic growth and financialdeepening.My ideas on this topic are organised along the following lines. To begin with, I shalldwell upon the process of growth and financial deepening in India. This will be followed bydefinitional aspects and some evidence from the experience of other countries, with regard tofinancial inclusion. Thereafter, the focus would be on interlinking the relevance of financialinclusion in our economy, which has entered a high growth orbit, with the rural economy. Thepenultimate section focuses on the role being played by the Reserve Bank in this regard. Myconcluding thoughts would be in the nature of issues that have a bearing on financialinclusion.II. Economic GrowthThe growth trend of the Indian economy over the last few years appears to indicatethe beginning of a new phase of higher growth. From an average growth rate of around 6.0per cent for a quarter of a century, the growth rate has accelerated to 8.1 per cent over the lastfew years. Along with declining population growth, this suggests high growth in per capitaincome in excess of 6 per cent in recent years, and perhaps approaching 7 per cent, whichwould lead to doubling of per capita income every ten years.  Most importantly, the currentgrowth process is not a flash in the pan and is exhibiting signs of sustainability along withfinancial stability, notwithstanding the pressures from unforeseen external shocks.On the savings front, the increasing trend in gross domestic saving as a proportion ofGDP witnessed since the early 2000s has also continued unabated. The gross domesticsavings  rate has improved from 23.6 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to 29.1 per cent in 2004-05,led by a turnaround of 4.2 per cent in public saving, from a dis-saving of 2.2 per cent of GDPin 2001-02 to a saving of 2.0 per cent in 2004-05, mainly reflecting the fiscal consolidationprocess. Household savings continue to grow and increased corporate savings reflect theirhealthy growth in profitability.  The encouraging sign of a pick up in investment has alsostrengthened unhindered. Along with the improvements in savings and investment rates, therehas also been a marked lowering of inflation from 7.8 per cent in the 1990s to 4.7 per cent inrecent years.  With such healthy increases in savings and investment rates financialintermediation is assuming increasing importance (Annex Table 1).Alongside these improvements there has also been a resurgence of manufacturingactivity.  There had been noted stagnation in manufacturing during 1997-2003.  Overallindustrial recovery set in during 2002-03 and this has been sustained since then on the back ofhealthy growth in domestic demand, along with that of exports supported by high worldeconomic growth, increasing capacity utilisation, augmentation of capacity, and positivebusiness and consumer confidence.  But there is little evidence of significant growth inmanufacturing employment leading to emerging doubts in the inclusive nature of this growth.The current high industrial growth is reflected in the acceleration in growth of bankcredit in recent years.  Average growth in non-food credit between 1970 and 2000 had been16.9 per cent, which had been seen as evidence of finance led industrialisation by some (Bell,2001).  In the period of industrial slowdown, 1998 to 2002, annual growth in non-food credithad also slowed to 14.5 per cent - leading to my comment on “lazy banking”.  In recent years,during 2002-03 to 2005-06, this growth has accelerated significantly to 28.8 per cent, possiblysignalling financial deepening of the system.Much of this recent expansion in non-food credit has been fuelled by an increase inretail credit. During the same period, 2002-03 to 2005-06 annual growth in retail credit was46 per cent: its share in overall bank credit consequently increased from 6.4 per cent in 1990-291 to 25.5 per cent in 2005-2006.  Earlier, most of bank credit had gone to the industrialcorporate sector.  Hence this shift to retail credit can also be seen as a move toward financialdeepening, and one that itself fuels industrial and overall economic growth through expansionof greater demand for consumer goods.The high industrial growth is also corroborated by the record of very healthyperformance of the corporate sector, which has recorded unusually high profit growth over thepast three years: over 40 per cent growth in profit after tax for 11 successive quarters from Q32002-03 to Q 2005-06. Although this growth has slowed somewhat in the last four quarters,1it continues to be high, between 25 and 35 per cent.  Corporate sector savings have grownfrom 4.4 per cent of GDP in 1999-2002 to 5.3 per cent in 2004-05.  Hence, the probability ofcontinued high corporate growth in terms of output is made more likely by the availability ofhigh retained earnings, burgeoning valuations, and continued productivity growth.All these developments point to overall financial deepening but, once again, one hasto ask the question whether such performance extends to small and medium enterprises alsoand, whether there has also been extension of financial intermediation for such enterprises,raising issues of financial inclusion.The high industrial and credit growth of recent years has also been supported by hightrade growth in both merchandise goods and services.  Merchandise exports have grown from5.8 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to about 13.1 per cent in 2005-06; and gross invisible receiptshave grown from 2.4 per cent to 11.5 per cent of GDP.  If we take gross trade, the sum of bothcurrent account receipts and payments, as a proportion of GDP as an index of the openness ofthe economy, this has increased from 19.2 per cent in 1990-91 to 49.5 per cent in 2005-06.Since all such receipts and payments pass through the banking system, this increasingopenness of the economy has also added to financial deepening, while aiding the accelerationin economic growth (Annex Table 2).The high credit growth witnessed in recent years has, however, not been matched byadequate deposit growth.  The growth in deposits since 2001-02 has been far lower than thatrequired to support overall credit expansion (Graph 1).  Banks have been financing much ofthe incremental credit expansion by unwinding their surplus investments in governmentsecurities.  What deposit growth that has been observed is, moreover, concentrated in thelarger cities: presumably it has been helped by the high corporate profitability leading to highcorporate cash balances.  The trend therefore indicates that while banks may have beenproactive in credit deployment, their focus on deposit mobilisation may have been less thanadequate.  The indication that deposit growth in non metro areas has been slow could alsomean that financial inclusion may have suffered.  We also need to understand that if depositgrowth does not match credit growth, excess demand would inevitably lead to increases inreal interest rates leading to further possibility of financial exclusion.3Graph 1: Growth in Aggregate Deposits and Credit35.030.025.020.015.010.05.00.0Aggregate Deposit Non-Food CreditOverall, it is clear from the recent performance of the economy and that of thefinancial sector that a good deal of financial sector growth has accompanied the recentacceleration of economic growth.  We also observe that a good part of credit growth has gonetowards financing consumption and housing which suggests widening of the financial system.But deposit growth has been slow, particularly outside metro areas, leading to questionsconcerning financial deepening and inclusion.III. Financial DeepeningThere is a general consensus among economists that financial development spurseconomic growth. Theoretically, financial development creates enabling conditions forgrowth through either a supply-leading (financial development spurs growth) or a demand-following (growth generates demand for financial products) channel. A large body ofempirical research supports the view that development of the financial system contributes toeconomic growth (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). Empirical evidence consistently emphasises thenexus between finance and growth, though the issue of direction of causality is more difficultto determine. At the cross-country level, evidence indicates that various measures of financialdevelopment (including assets of the financial intermediaries, liquid liabilities of financialinstitutions, domestic credit to private sector, stock and bond market capitalisation) arerobustly and positively related to economic growth (King and Levine, 1993; Levine andZervos, 1998). Other studies establish a positive relationship between financial developmentand growth at the industry level (Rajan and Zingales, 1998). Even the recent endogenousgrowth literature, building on 'learning by doing' processes, assigns a special role to finance(Aghion and Hewitt, 1998 and 2005).A developed financial system broadens access to funds; conversely, in anunderdeveloped financial system, access to funds is limited and people are constrained by theavailability of their own funds and have to resort to high cost informal sources such as moneylenders. Lower the availability of funds and higher their cost, fewer would be the economicactivities that can be financed and hence lower the resulting economic growth.4per cent1980-811982-831984-851986-871988-891990-911992-931994-951996-971998-992000-012002-032004-05Some of the recent concerns on financial inclusion have emanated from the results ofthe All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2002. Over a period of 40 years, the shareof non-institutional sources of credit in sources of credit for cultivator households haddeclined sharply from about 93 per cent in 1951 to about 30 per cent in 1991, with the shareof money lenders having declined from 69.7 per cent to 17.5 per cent. In 2002, the AIDISrevealed, however, that the share of money lenders had again increased to 27 per cent, whilethat of non-institutional sources overall rose to 39 per cent (Table 1). In other words,notwithstanding the outreach of banking, the formal credit system has not been able toadequately penetrate the informal financial markets; rather it seems to have shrunk in somerespects in recent years.Coincidentally, it is also true that the rate of agricultural growth during the lastdecade has slowed down and it is particularly striking in respect of foodgrains production.Since the green revolution, banks have been mainly focused on financing crop loansconnected largely with food grains. There is, therefore, reason to believe that financialexclusion may actually have increased in the rural areas over the last 10-15 years.Table 1: Relative Share of Borrowing of Cultivator Households#(per cent)Sources of Credit 1951 1961 1971 1981 1991 2002$1 2 3 4 5 6 7Non-institutional 92.7 81.3 68.3 36.8 30.6 38.9 of which:   Money lenders 69.7 49.2 36.1 16.1 17.5 26.8Institutional 7.3 18.7 31.7 63.2 66.3 61.1 of which:   Co-operative societies, etc. 3.3 2.6 22.0 29.8 30.0 30.2   Commercial banks 0.9 0.6 2.4 28.8 35.2 26.3   Unspecified - - - - 3.1 -Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0# : Borrowing refers to outstanding cash dues.th$ : AIDIS, NSSO, 59 Round, 2003.Source: All India Debt and Investment Surveys.One of the key features of financial deepening is that it accelerates economic growththrough the expansion of access to those who do not have adequate finance themselves.Typically, in an underdeveloped financial system, it is the incumbents who have better accessto financial services through relationship banking. Moreover, incumbents also finance theirgrowth through internal resource generation. Thus, in an underdeveloped financial system,growth is constrained to the expansion potential of incumbents. In mature financial systemson the other hand, financial institutions develop appraisal techniques, and informationgathering and sharing mechanisms, which then enable banks to even finance those activitiesor firms that are at the margin, thereby leading to their growth-inducing productive activitiesin addition to the incumbents. It is this availability of external finance to buddingentrepreneurs and small firms that enables new entry, while also providing competition toincumbents and consequently encouraging entrepreneurship and productivity.What has been the case in India? As I mentioned earlier, the incredible corporateprofit growth, in excess of 40 per cent for almost three years consecutively, would suggestthat there should have been massive new entry to whittle down profitability to more moderatelevels. This, however, does not seem to be the case on the ground yet with corporateprofitability still growing at an annual rate of around 35 per cent during April-June 2006.5That entry of new firms has possibly been limited is also indicated by the fact that among thedifferent categories of credit growth, lending to SMEs has been the lowest, though there aresome signs of higher growth in recent months.There are, however, other signs of financial deepening (Mohan, 2004). According toone indicator of financial deepening, the ratio of bank assets to GDP, financial depth in Indiawas among the lowest in the world (Barth, Caprio and Levine, 2001). Comparable cross-country data indicated that in 2001, this ratio, at 48 per cent for India, was lower than thoseprevalent in Asian economies such as Indonesia (101 per cent), Korea (98 per cent),Philippines (91 per cent), Malaysia (166 per cent) and much lower than developed economies,such as UK (311 per cent), France (147 per cent) and Germany (313 per cent). In India, whilethe ratio of bank assets to GDP has increased significantly to a shade over 80 per cent in2005-06 – obviously a consequence of the high credit growth in recent years - it is still lowerthan other emerging countries. In absolute terms, the annual expansion in non-food credit hasincreased from Rs.64,302 crore in 2001-02 to Rs.3,54,193 crore in 2005-06, while retail credithas increased from around Rs.16,000 crore to Rs.1,09,129 crore. So, it needs to be recognisedthat financial deepening has been taking place on an accelerated pace on a macro basis inrecent years, that banking productivity has improved significantly, and that bankers haveclearly been very busy.Whereas banks have clearly taken to heart my remarks on “lazy banking” on the assetcreation side, they have not matched this creditable performance on the liability side.  Dare Irepeat the same expression!An important question that arises logically is: has commensurate financial deepeningbeen taking place at the micro-level?  There is sufficient anecdotal evidence to suggest thatthe poor or less well-off people find it difficult to open a bank account in any area – rural,urban or semi-urban. Thus, not only is the common individual deprived of access to banks forgenerating savings or availing credit, but so is the financial system of resourcescommensurate with the burgeoning growth of incomes all over the country.  It is this veryfeature that the process of financial inclusion seeks to address. This is an aspect to which Iturn next.IV. Financial InclusionI begin by looking at exactly the opposite of financial inclusion, i.e., financialexclusion. Broadly defined, financial exclusion signifies the lack of access by certainsegments of the society to appropriate, low-cost, fair and safe financial products and servicesfrom mainstream providers. Financial exclusion is thus a key policy concern, because theoptions for operating a household budget, or a micro/small enterprise, without mainstreamfinancial services can often be expensive. This process becomes self-reinforcing and can oftenbe an important factor in social exclusion, especially for communities with limited access tofinancial products, particularly in rural areas.Two major factors have often been cited as the consequences of financial exclusion.First, it complicates day-to-day cash flow management - being financially excluded meanshouseholds, and micro and small enterprises deal entirely in cash and are susceptible toirregular cash flows. Second, lack of financial planning and security in the absence of accessto bank accounts and other saving opportunities for people in the unorganised sector limittheir options for providing for themselves for their old age. From the macroeconomicstandpoint, being without formal savings can be problematic in two respects. First, peoplewho save by informal means rarely benefit from the interest rate and tax advantages thatpeople using formal methods of savings enjoy. Second, informal saving channels are muchless secure than formal saving facilities. Those who can afford it least suffer the highest risk.The resultant lack of savings and saving avenues means recourse to non-formal lenders, like6money lenders. This, in turn, could lead to two adverse consequences – a) exposure to higherinterest rates charged by formal lenders; and b) the inability of customers to service the loansor to repay them. As loans from non-formal lenders are often secured against the borrower’sproperty, this raises the problem of inter-linkage between two apparently separate markets.Judged in this specific context, financial exclusion is a serious concern among low-incomehouseholds, mainly located in rural areas.Once access to financial institutions improves, inclusion affords several benefits tothe consumer, regulator and the economy alike. Establishment of an account relationship canpave the way for the customer to avail the benefits of a variety of financial products, whichare not only standardised, but are also provided by institutions that are regulated andsupervised by credible regulators, and are hence safer.  The bank accounts can also be usedfor multiple purposes, such as, making small value remittances at low cost and makingpurchases on credit. Furthermore, the regulator benefits, as the audit trail is available andtransactions are conducted transparently in a medium that can be monitored. The economybenefits, as greater financial resources become transparently available for efficientintermediation and allocation, for uses that have the highest returns.  In other words, thesingle gateway of a banking account can be used for several purposes and represents abeneficial situation for all the economic units in the country.In addition, I would like to flag an important perspective.  Improvements in ruralinfrastructure in terms of availability of electricity, improvement in connectivity throughprovision of rural roads and telecommunications, and construction of warehouses, areexpected to lead to better overall supply chain management, enhance productivity of physicalresources in the rural areas and greater addition in agriculture. These developments wouldlead to much greater demand for banking activity in rural areas. The two-fold implications ofthese developments for the banking sector are apparent. First, with higher financing needs ofsuch new activities vis-a-vis traditional ones, the overall financing intensity of agriculture islikely to experience a manifold rise. Second, along with growth in rural infrastructure, there isalso likely to be an increase in rural non-farm activities, such as repair activities, education,housing, restaurants and medical services. These activities, both traditional and emergingventures, would be available for financing by the banking sector.Thus, as the economy begins to grow rapidly, the rate of financial intermediation isexpected to increase further. In other words, the banking system will be expected toincreasingly provide larger quantum of funds to existing and emerging enterprises. Andwithout adequate deposit growth, however, credit expansion might not be sustainable over themedium-term, without putting immense pressure on real interest rates and impacting theoverall stability of the financial system.International ExperienceTypically, countries with low levels of income inequality tend to have lower levels offinancial exclusion, while high levels of exclusion are associated with the least equal ones. InSweden, for example, lower than two per cent of adults did not have an account in 2000 andin Germany, the figure was around three per cent (Kempson, 2006). In comparison, less thanfour per cent of adults in Canada and five per cent in Belgium, lacked a bank account(Buckland et al, 2005). Countries with high levels of inequality record higher levels ofbanking exclusion.  To illustrate, in Portugal, about 17 per cent of the adult population had noaccount of any kind in 2000 (Kempson, 2006).The policy responses to such exclusion have been varied (Box 1).  In Sweden, forexample, banks cannot refuse to open a saving or deposit account under Section 2 of theBanking Business Act of 1987; in France, Article 58 of the Banking Act, 1984 recognised theprinciple of the right to a bank account; in the US, federal government introduced the7Community Reinvestment Act in 1997, partly in response to concerns about bank branchclosures in low-income neighbourhoods. Under this legislation, federal bank regulatoryagencies rate banks on their efforts to serve low-income communities. These early legislationswere designed to ensure access to a deposit account but did not spell out the nature of bankingservices that should be on offer. Refinements in this area have actually taken place in thelatter half of the 1990s, resulting partly from a wider concern regarding social exclusion(Caskey et al, 2006, Kempson et al, 2000). It may, thus, be noted that financial inclusion is aconcern even in developed countries and legislative or regulatory measure to achieve it are acommon feature.Box 1: Policy Response to Financial Exclusion – Country ExperiencesTwo major kinds of policy responses have been implemented by central banks inresponse to financial exclusion: codes of practice and specific legislation.  First, countriessuch as France and Belgium have undertaken initiatives to committing banks to open anaffordable account with bare minimum facilities. Termed 'call deposit account' in Belgium, itoffers three basic types of transactions: money transfers, deposits and withdrawals, and bankstatements.  However, individual banks may opt to offer other services if they wish. InGermany, a voluntary code was introduced by the German Bankers Association in 1996. Thismakes provision for an 'everyman' current account, offering basic banking transactions,without an overdraft facility. Likewise, access to basic banking in the United Kingdom andAustralia has been achieved through voluntary arrangements with banks and has not involvedformal charters. In the United Kingdom, for instance, a Banking Code has been drafted, whichrequires banks to inform customers about their basic bank account and its suitability for theirneeds. A Financial Inclusion Taskforce, instituted in April 2005, monitors access to basicbanking services.Several countries have also introduced specific legislation that gives both, a universalright to a bank account and, spells out the precise nature of banking services to be provided.In France, the law on exclusion of July 1998 reiterated the right to an account first set out inthe 1984 law and has since then simplified the process of exercising the right to an account. InBelgium, a banking bill was enacted which has been implemented since October 2003. Inaddition to setting out the minimum standards for basic bank accounts, it also specifies theceiling on charges and a minimum number of free face-to-face transactions. In many ways,the policy response in Canada combines the best of developments in other countries. Therelevant legislation, enacted in June 2001, requires all banks to provide accounts withoutminimum opening balances to all Canadians, regardless of employment or credit history, withminimum identification requirements. A Financial Consumer Agency of Canada has beenestablished to monitor whether financial institutions adhere to their public commitments.Sources:Kempson, E. (2006).

London: HM Treasury.Present Situation in IndiaI would like to share with you certain data that highlight my concern on financialexclusion. The share of deposits and credit in rural and semi-urban areas is on the decline. Incontrast, the share in metropolitan areas is rising.  The share of credit is lower than that of8deposits in all regions except metropolitan, implying that resources get intermediated intometropolitan areas (Table 2).  This in itself may not necessarily be undesirable or unexpectedif resources are being intermediated to their best uses.  However, they do provide someindication for concern and for the need for more investigation.Table 2: Spatial Distribution of Banking Services(Per cent)Offices Deposits Credit1969 1996 2005 1969 1996 2005 1969 1996 20051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10Rural 22.2 51.2 45.7 6.4 14.4 12.2 3.3 11.4 9.5Semi-urban 40.4 21.3 22.3 21.8 19.5 16.9 13.1 13.1 11.3Urban 19.2 15.2 17.6 26.5 22.4 21.5 21.8 17.7 16.4Metropolitan 18.2 12.3 14.4 45.3 43.7 49.4 61.8 57.8 62.7Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaThe total number of saving accounts, considered to be a better indicator of bankingpenetration than other deposit accounts, as per cent of number of households, was 137 in ruralareas and 244 in the urban areas on the eve of reforms in 1991. By 2005, despite the reforms,the differential continues to be similar. In the case of credit accounts, the situation hasdeteriorated for rural households while showing significant improvement in the urban areas(Table 3), corroborating the very significant increase in retail credit.Table 3: Number of Deposit and Credit Accounts in Scheduled Commercial Banks(Per cent of Number of Households)1981 1991 1996 2001 2004 20051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Deposit AccountsCurrent Accounts Rural 3.6 5.5 4.7 4.9 4.4 4.6Urban 15.0 23.4 24.1 19.2 17.5 18.3Savings Accounts Rural 59.6 137.0 129.8 123.3 126.8 131.5Urban 135.5 243.7 249.7 197.4 206.5 213.1Current and Saving Accounts Rural 63.2 142.6 134.5 128.2 131.1 136.1Urban 150.5 267.2 273.7 216.6 224.0 231.4Term Deposits Accounts Rural 22.9 41.8 45.5 52.0 48.3 45.7Urban 74.6 96.9 105.0 105.6 113.4 104.0Total Deposits Accounts Rural 86.1 184.4 180.0 180.1 179.4 181.8Urban 225.1 364.1 378.7 322.2 337.4 335.4Credit Accounts Rural 18.0 44.3 36.0 26.5 28.7 32.2Urban 15.1 29.9 27.1 28.4 42.5 50.2Notes:1.

For three new formed States, number of households, in 1991 have been estimated basedon 2001 data. Population is as per 1981, 1991 and 2001 census.

Similarly, credit extended, as per cent ofGDP, increased from 17.3 to 22.3 in rural and from 24.8 to 45.0 in urban areas (Table 4).  Interms of banking penetration, the number of deposit and credit accounts of scheduledcommercial banks as per cent of adult population are significantly lower in the rural areas ascompared with the urban areas (Table 5).Table 4: Deposits and Credit Amounts in Scheduled Commercial Banks(per cent of GDP)1981 1991 1996 2001 20051 2 3 4 5 6 7Deposit Accounts1.

In terms ofregional dis-aggregation since 1991, population per bank office has increased in rural areasfrom 13,462 in 1991 to 16,650 in 2005 and, as expected, declined in the urban areas from14,484 to 13,619 over the period. Three regions, North-Eastern, East and Central have higherpopulation per office than the all-India average and it has increased significantly in the ruralareas in 2005 over 1991 (Table 6).  Consequently, compared to an all-India average of 29.9savings accounts per 100 persons in 1991, virtually all of the states in the Eastern and North-Eastern regions and several pockets in the Central region had figures lower than this average.In the rural areas, Northern and Southern region are above the all-India average while in theurban areas, Northern and Western region dominate.  In terms of number of credit accountsper 100 persons, the Southern States, both in rural and urban areas perform above the all-Indiaaverage.Table 6: Regional Level Indicators of Scheduled Commercial Banks1991 2005 1991 2005 1991 2005Total Rural Urban1 2 3 4 5 6 7Population per OfficeNorthern 11,002 12,257 10,771 13,043 11,571 10,941North-East 16,870 26,227 16,335 22,158 21,169 20,318Eastern 16,441 19,913 16,402 21,208 16,614 15,759Central 15,786 19,518 15,153 20,264 18,745 17,297Western 12,771 14,618 12,579 15,526 13,108 13,472Southern 11,932 12,328 11,276 12,372 13,811 12,243All-India 13,711 15,680 13,462 16,650 14,484 13,619Deposits: Number of Savings Accounts per 100 personsNorthern 40.0 38.3 30.1 29.7 62.6 55.4North-East 17.8 17.6 16.1 16.4 28.4 24.2Eastern 21.8 20.5 17.7 16.9 40.0 36.1Central 23.8 24.5 21.0 22.1 34.7 32.9Western 35.5 32.5 24.7 23.8 53.8 45.2Southern 37.0 37.6 34.6 35.5 42.7 41.8All-India 29.9 29.2 24.5 24.4 45.6 41.6Credit: Number of Credit Accounts per 100 personsNorthern 6.4 5.7 6.6 5.1 5.9 6.7North-East 4.4 3.3 4.4 3.2 4.4 3.9Eastern 6.6 4.2 7.2 4.2 4.3 4.3Central 5.5 4.3 5.8 4.2 4.4 4.5Western 5.7 7.5 6.2 4.2 4.8 12.2Southern 11.8 14.2 13.6 12.7 7.6 17.4All-India 7.3 7.0 7.9 6.0 5.5 9.8Notes: Same as in Tables 3 and 4.Source: Same as in Table 3.Thus, the apparent implication emerging from the above data reveals that the ruralareas are not being served adequately by banks.  This suggests that banks need to make effortsto mobilise resources from the rural sector, where as discussed earlier, scope for increase inbusiness is emerging.  Further, if the banks are to balance their overall deposit mobilisation11and credit extension, as generally robust banking practice would imply, then they would needto devise imaginative ways to mop up the resources, particularly in rural areas.V. Rural Economy- Growth, Production Patterns and Credit ExtensionIt is instructive to examine the rural economy in a bit more detail. Although the shareof agriculture in overall GDP has declined from around 35.8 per cent in 1980-81 to less than19.9 per cent at present, the fall in the proportion of population dependent on the sector hasbeen limited (Table 7). In other words, a majority of the workforce is still dependent onagriculture, while the GDP growth due to agriculture is marginally above the rate of growth ofthe population, in contrast to a strong growth rate in the non-agriculture sector.Table 7: Components of Gross Domestic Products*(Per cent)Year/Sector Agriculture Of which: Industry Services Totaland Allied Agriculture1 2 3 4 5 61970-71 to 1979-80 42.8 37.7 16.9 40.3 100.01980-81 to 1989-90 36.4 33.1 19.5 44.0 100.01990-91 to 1999-2000 29.1 26.7 21.9 49.0 100.02000-01 to 2005-06 21.9 20.8 21.4 56.7 100.0*: Annual averages.Source: National Account Statistics.The slowdown in agriculture in recent years is characterised by the stagnation indomestic production in case of commodities like wheat, sugar and pulses. There has been amarked deceleration in the share of cereals in total production (agriculture and allied) from31.7 per cent in 1960-61 to 24.1 per cent in 2004-05 (Table 8). On the other hand, the share ofother segments such as livestock and fishing, and non-cereals are recording a significantincrease.  There has been a silent revolution over the last 20 years, unnoticed by researchersand policy makers alike.  The value of output of non cereal vegetarian food and of non-vegetarian food (livestock and fishing) is each higher than that of cereals.  In principle, theseactivities should be more credit intensive.  It is, therefore, of utmost importance that ourimage of what is agriculture, changes from that of simple rice and wheat to a more complexstructure, so that policy makers can assign due importance to the sector and respondaccordingly (Mohan, 2006).Table 8: Changing Pattern of Agricultural ProductionYear Cereals Non- Cash crops Livestock Forestry Ag. andand pulses cereals and fishing and alliedfood logging (Rs. crore)Sectoral shares: as per cent of agriculture and allied1 2 3 4 5 6 71960-61 31.7 33.6 4.9 20.3 9.5 1,32,2921970-71 31.4 34.9 4.8 20.1 8.8 1,69,0661980-81 30.3 36.2 4.4 23.4 5.7 2,26,7191990-91 28.6 36.4 4.5 26.2 4.3 3,10,1652000-01 25.4 37.6 3.9 28.0 3.9 5,68,9902004-05 24.1 n.a n.a 29.2 3.8 6,22,183Source: National Accounts Statistics.12Apart from non-cereal food production, service and manufacturing activities havealso been growing faster in rural areas.  There are new supply chain activities: sorting,grading, storage, cold storage, transportation, food processing, and the like.  All are in thecash economy and potentially in need of credit. In fact, it is estimated that agriculture nowaccounts for less than half of rural GDP: an epochal change that took place some time in thelate 1990s.  So “rural” can no longer be equated with agriculture.  The consequence is thatrural per capita income has probably been growing at a rate similar to that of urban per capitalincome.There is also good evidence (NCAER) of the dramatic changes in consumption andincome growth and distribution patterns in the rural economy.  As classified consistently byNCAER, keeping real income cut offs constant, the proportion of households classified as“low income” in rural areas has fallen from about two thirds in the early 1990s to only about aquarter now.  At the same time, those classified as middle income households have risen froma third to almost 70 per cent now (NCAER, 2003).  Hence, there should have been a surge infinancial savings in rural areas: but we do not see evidence of this in the number or proportionof households that have bank accounts.The banking system needs to adjust to the realities in the rural sector.  There isevidence they are finding it difficult.  As the ratio of agricultural GDP to total GDP declines,agricultural credit to total GDP would also decline.  However, this is not observed from thedata (Table 9).  In recent years a concern over the falling share of agricultural credit as aproportion of total credit has been expressed.  The data reveal that agriculture credit as a ratioof total credit has also been rising in the recent years but is still below the level of 1970s.Table 9: Ratio of Direct Agricultural Credit to Agricultural GDP,Total GDP and total CreditYear Ag.

It is gratifying to note that agriculture credit has not fallen as aproportion of agricultural GDP despite the share of food grain production declining as aproportion of total agricultural production. In fact, according to available data, agriculturalcredit has been rising in recent years as a share of both the value of inputs and the value ofoutputs (Table 10).13Moreover, long-term credit as a share of private investment has also been rising in the1990s (Table 11). The balance of evidence also suggests that non-performing loans (NPLs) inagriculture are not higher than in other sectors, more specifically those in small-scaleindustries (SSIs). To illustrate, NPLs in agriculture - both for public as well as private banks –were lower than those in the SSIs as at end-March 2005 (Mohan, 2006).Table 10: Gross Value of Output, Value of Input and Short-Term Credit(Rs. crore at current prices)Year Gross value Value of input Short- Short-term creditof output term as percentage ofcreditValue of output Value of input1 2 3 4 5 61993-94 2,71,839 55,401 5,424 2.0 9.81998-99 4,88,731 93,416 10,821 2.2 11.61999-2000 5,26,658 1,21,878 12,610 2.4 10.32000-01 5,29,800 1,26,773 15,442 2.9 12.22001-02 5,66,563 1,37,802 18,882 3.3 13.72002-03 5,56,121 1,51,437 23,324 4.2 15.42003-04 6,25,121 1,53,770 31,972 5.1 20.82004-05 6,48,096 1,59,658 .. .. .... : Not available.Source: National Accounts Statistics.

Inview of the evidence of a pick-up in consumer financing in rural areas, there is also a need tostreamline the supply chain to deliver credit at the lowest cost to the ultimate user in the ruralareas, to the benefit of both the bank and the borrower. And, as is the case for mostdeveloping countries, bank credit will be the key driver towards financing emerging activities.VI. Strategy for Bank CreditThere has been a long history of concern regarding agricultural credit.  The increasein share of institutional credit to agriculture has been rather slow.  It has clearly been founddifficult to extend institutional credit in rural areas.  Some of the important reasons pertained14to risk perception, costs of its assessment and management, lack of rural infrastructure, andvast geographical spread of the rural areas with more than half a million villages, somesparsely populated.Lending to small borrowers dispersed over vast expenses of geographical areasnaturally involve high transaction costs.  The strategy that evolved after considerableexperimentation was to provide for directed credit to priority sectors that have primarilyincluded agriculture and small scale industries.  This was also the key reason fornationalisation of banks.  That this strategy has been relatively successful is borne out by thedata (Table 1), but it may have reached its limit, as also demonstrated by the deterioration inthe reach of formal credit in the 1990s.The key issue now is how to mainstream rural credit from institutional sources so asto achieve wider coverage, expand financial inclusion and promote economic growth.Increasingly, banks and other financial intermediaries have to see the extension of rural creditas a business opportunity and not as an obligation to do forced directed lending.One strategy that is achieving great popularity and wide acceptance is that of microfinance, as best exemplified by the success of the Bangladesh Grameen Bank, which has nowalso achieved even greater recognition through the award of the Nobel Peace Prize toMohammad Yunus.  But most micro finance is not only for crops, but for other lending, inboth rural and urban areas.  The main issue is that of reducing transaction costs for both thelender and the borrower.For banks, micro finance agencies and other financial intermediaries to look at rurallending as business opportunities, much more information generation has to be done so thatthey recognise and understand the many different activities that take place in the ruraleconomy in addition to crop agriculture.  Non cereal foods, non-food agriculture, serviceactivities, construction and housing, rural retail activities, will all increasing levels of formalfinancing channels that are easy to access.  This will need innovation in risk assessment,reduction in transaction costs, the search for new credit channels, and the use of cheaperinformation technology for delivery and collection systems. The task of policy-makers in designing an appropriate package of measures becomesmore challenging considering the fact that the new growth areas of agriculture arecharacterised by a high degree of heterogeneity, unlike in the case of traditional crops such asrice and wheat. There is a multiplicity of varieties that can be produced in each of theseproduct groups; production is often regionally concentrated; the production and marketingconditions differ significantly; and the input requirements are equally heterogeneous. Hence,policies and programmes that are to be attuned to support higher productivity and productionin these areas need to be much more regionally disaggregated and knowledge intensive. A keydifference in approach would have to be the much greater involvement of region-specificmarket participants, and of private sector suppliers in all these activities, and credit suppliersranging from public sector banks, co-operative banks, the new private sector banks andmicro-credit suppliers, especially self-help groups.To finance all these new activities, which will aid and accelerate economic growthtremendously, banks will clearly need to step up their efforts in generating deposits as wellfrom the many currently underserved households and small businesses.15VII. Role of RBIHistorically, the Reserve Bank and the Government of India have been making effortsto increase banking penetration in the country.  Some of these measures include the creationof State Bank of India in 1955; nationalisation of commercial banks in 1969 and 1980;initiating the Lead Bank Scheme in 1970; establishing regional rural banks (RRBs) in 1975;introducing a Self-help Group (SHG)-Bank Linkage Programme in 1992 and formulating theKisan Credit Card scheme in 2001. Notwithstanding these improvements, financial inclusionfound a place in policy documents only very recently. In the Annual Policy of the ReserveBank for 2004-05, the Governor, Dr. Reddy observed and I quote -There has been expansion, greater competition and diversification ofownership of banks leading to both enhanced efficiency and systemicresilience in the banking sector. However, there are legitimate concerns inregard to the banking practices that tend to exclude rather than attract vastsections of population, in particular pensioners, self-employed and thoseemployed in unorganised sector. While commercial considerations are nodoubt important, the banks have been bestowed with several privileges,especially of seeking public deposits on a highly leveraged basis, andconsequently they should be obliged to provide banking services to allsegments of the population, on equitable basis.Pursuant to this, the Reserve Bank has undertaken a number of measures with theobjective of attracting the financially excluded population into the structured financial system.These measures, mainly, are in the nature of code of ethics and voluntary charters to promotegreater financial access (Box 2).Box 2: Measures undertaken by Reserve Bank towards Financial InclusionIn November 2005, banks were advised to make available a basic banking ‘no-frills’ account withlow or nil minimum stipulated balances as well as charges to expand the outreach of such accountsto vast sections of the population. Several banks have since introduced such 'no-frills' account withand without value-added features.  According to the information available with the Reserve Bank,about five lakh no-frill accounts have been opened until March 31, 2006, of which about two-thirdare with the public sector and one-third with the private sector banks.In order to ensure that persons belonging to low income group, both in urban and rural areas donot encounter difficulties in opening bank accounts owing to procedural hassles, the know yourcustomer (KYC) procedures for opening accounts has been simplified. The Reserve Bank hasdirected banks to make available all printed material used by retail customers in English, Hindiand the concerned regional language. More recently, in January 2006, banks were permitted toutilise the services of non-governmental organisations (NGOs/SHGs), micro-finance institutionsand other civil society organisations as intermediaries in providing financial and banking servicesthrough the use of business facilitator and business correspondent models.To extend hassle-free credit to bank customers in rural areas, the guidelines on general credit card(GCC) schemes were simplified to enable customers’ access credit on simplified terms andconditions, without insistence on security, purpose or end-use of credit. With a view of providinghassle free credit to customers, banks were allowed to issue general credit cards akin to Kisancredit cards. A simplified mechanism for one-time settlement of loans with principal amount up toRs.25,000 which have become doubtful and loss assets as on September 30, 2005 was suggestedfor adoption. In case of loans granted under Government-sponsored schemes, banks were advisedto frame separate guidelines following a state-specific approach to be evolved by the State-LevelBankers’ Committee (SLBC). Banks have been specifically advised that borrowers with loanssettled under the one time settlement scheme will be eligible to re-access the formal financial16system for fresh credit. Banks were advised to give effect to these measures at all branches forachieving greater financial inclusion. Initiatives have also been undertaken towards achievinggreater financial inclusion in the North-Eastern region, which had perennially remained under-banked.The Reserve Bank considers that IT-enabled services can meet the challenges which need to beaddressed for increasing the scope and coverage of financial inclusion such as lack of adequateinfrastructure, higher transaction costs and low volumes of transactions. The Reserve Bank hasalready initiated action in the North-Eastern region.Source: Reserve Bank of India.The Reserve Bank has also been periodically issuing guidelines on public grievanceredressal mechanism in banks, including constitution of customer service centers. Based onthe recommendations of a Committee on Procedures and Performance Audit of PublicServices for ensuring improvements in quality of service rendered, banks were advised toconstitute a Customer Service Committee of the Board. In the Reserve Bank, the CustomerService Department has recently been constituted to, inter alia, serve as the interface betweencustomers and banks.On a broader plane, the Reserve Bank has been adopting a two-pronged strategy togenerate greater awareness and expand the reach of banking services – which can be termedas empowerment and protection. As regards the former, financial inclusion is the first stage ofthe process. This is strengthened by inculcating awareness among the masses throughfinancial education. Concurrently, an advisory mechanism in the form of credit counseling isbeing encouraged to help distressed borrowers and bring them within the fold of formalfinance. As regards protection, a Banking Codes and Standards Board of India has beenestablished recently to ensure a comprehensive code of conduct for minimum standards ofbanking services to be offered by banks. The revised Banking Ombudsman Scheme has beenput in place to redress deficiencies in customer service by banks.VIII. Concluding RemarksThe economy is presently in a phase of rapidly rising incomes, rural and urban,arising from an expansion of extant economic activities as well as the creation of newactivities. Corporate profitability has exhibited sustainable trends and consumer incomes areincreasing rapidly, riding on the growth momentum. All of these developments suggest thatthe demand for financial services, both for savings as well as production purposes, will begreater than has been the case in the past, and there will be many new entrants in need offinancial services who have not hitherto been served.  At present our financial depth is muchlower than that of other Asian countries, though it has picked up in the recent past.  Whilethere is evidence of an increase in financial deepening, particularly during the present decade,the increase in the breadth and coverage of formal finance has been less than adequate.Deepening the financial system and widening its reach is crucial for both accelerating growthand for equitable distribution, given the present stage of development of our country.   There has been a burst of entrepreneurship across the country, spanning rural, semi-urban and urban areas. This has to be nurtured and financed. It is only through growth ofenterprises across all sizes that competition will be fostered. A small entrepreneur today willbe a big entrepreneur tomorrow, and might well become a multinational enterprise eventuallyif given the comfort of financial support.  But we also have to understand that there will befailures as well as successes.  Banks will therefore have to tone up their risk assessment andrisk management capacities, and provide for these failures as part of their risk management.Despite the risk, financing of first time entrepreneurs is a must for financial inclusion andgrowth.17The Parliament passed the Credit Information Bureau Act last year and the guidelinesfor its implementation will be released shortly.  This should enable, over time, the availabilityof credit histories of both individuals and small businesses, which will help significantly inreducing transactions and information costs for banks.  It will also help in spreading the creditculture among borrowers.  It should help banks greatly in assessing and managing risk at lowcost. As poverty levels decline and households have greater levels of discretionary incomes,they will be first time financial savers. They will, therefore, need to have easy access toformal financial systems to get into the banking habit. Banks will need to innovate and devisenewer methods of including such customers into their fold. The importance of 'no-frills'account and expanding the range of identity documents that is acceptable to open an accountwithout sacrificing objectivity of the process in this milieu can never be over-emphasised.Banks will need to go to their customers, rather than the other way around.The micro-credit and the Self Help Group movements are in their infancy but aregathering force. More innovation in the form of business facilitators and correspondents willbe needed for banks to increase their outreach for banks to ensure financial inclusion. Newentrants to the banking system need households at their doorstep.To conclude, I wish to stress that with increasing liberalisation and higher economicgrowth, the role of banking sector is poised to increase in the financing pattern of economicactivities within the country. To meet the growing credit demand, the banks need to mobiliseresources from a wider deposit base and extend credit to activities hitherto not financed bybanks. The trend of increasing commercialisation of agriculture and rural activities shouldgenerate greener pastures, and banks should examine the benefits of increasing penetrationtherein. Financial inclusion will strengthen financial deepening and provide resources to thebanks to expand credit delivery.  Thus, financial inclusion will lead to financial developmentin our country which will help to accelerate economic growth.Thank you.18ReferencesAghion, P., and P.
