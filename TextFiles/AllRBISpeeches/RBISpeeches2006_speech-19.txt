 ????IT FOR BUSINESS EXCELLENCELadies and Gentlemen,It gives me great pleasure to be present here to share a few thoughtson one of the important drivers of banking business in the world.  InformationTechnology or IT has made substantial inroads into the financial sector, it hasin fact transformed the way banking operations are conducted. The benefitsbrought about by IT in handling large processing volumes, in providing forquick, safe transaction processing, economies of scale and in expanding thereach and coverage of banking services, and above all product innovationhave all been enormous.Today’s banking business has become most challenging with customerexpectations rising as each day passes by. This calls for substantive changesin the way in which banks do the business and in the nature of products theyoffer. If the well accepted principle of Six Sigma that signifies excellence inbusiness processes will have to happen in the Indian financial sector, I haveno doubt that the IT has to play a crucial role. Let me commence by flagging some issues which stem from extensiveuse of IT. Organisations that understand and tackle these issues (being verycommon perceptions let me call them “premises”) will be in a better position toharness the opportunities. This may well differentiate a winner from a looser.• The most common premise is that for successful technologicalimprovements, people with the right aptitude are required; manyorganisations even conduct aptitude tests to select the ‘right’type of personnel. My own experience is that attitude is moreimportant than aptitude. A person who is willing to learn is abetter asset than one who is technology savvy but refuses tochange.                                                          ???? Address by Shri V Leeladhar, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Banknet India's 2ndInternational Bank Tech Summit, Mumbai, on September 21, 2006.• Another premise is that if technological changes areimplemented at lower levels, these can be replicated at all tiersof the organisation. This may not be always the case. Mostsuccessful technological updations have followed the ‘Top-Down’ approach, where the changes are not merely triggeredfrom the Top but are followed religiously by the top most officialin the hierarchy. Most organisations which have effectiveInformation Security (IS) policies are those where thecommitment and implementation levels commence from the topand percolate downwards.• A common premise about technology is that technologyprovides solutions for all problem situations. While this may begenerally true, it is very often the case that there aretechnological solutions for operational problems, but operationalrestrictions cannot come to the aid of technological problems. Inother words, problems and issues relating to the technologyhave to be sorted by means of changes in the technologicalsolution itself. All of us must have experienced vendors whohave provided technology solutions suggesting that someprocedures or that some of the environmental aspects could bemodified to suit the technological process which has beenimplemented. This is a case for certain failure. The case of anew bank which commenced its operations by dispensing awaywith the savings bank pass books had to beat a hasty retreatand give the option to its customers by providing a technologicalsolution - customers could take print outs of their statement ofaccounts at any time from their own system!• Yet another premise is that the process of change can be forcedupon people. It is now widely accepted that change has to befrom within and external forces only facilitate or accelerate theprocess of change. The old adage of ‘You can take the horse tothe water but cannot make it drink’ is relevant in this context. Acase in point pertains to the use of cards by customers of banks.Page 2 of 6A decade ago, banks had to offer incentives to customers to usecards for their transactions, and there was general reluctance touse the card by even the discerning customer. Today,customers have realised that the cards offer better convenienceand have changed over to large scale usage of the cards, basedon their conviction. That the Direct Selling Agents employed bybanks hastened the process of migration is an accepted fact, butthis was not the major factor in the change process.• Perhaps the most important premise relating to change pertainsto the relationship between security and stability. If a changeprocess has to be successful, there has to be a harmoniousbalance between the perceived levels of insecurity andinstability by the participants in the change process. Even if oneof these factors has a higher perceived weightage, the changebecomes difficult to implement.In a nutshell, it is essential that managing change is taken as a veryserious task with the complete commitment and support from the Top levels ofall organisations. This is particularly more relevant in banks, where personnelmanning the front desk are the most important link between the bank and thecustomer can make or break a change. A bank staff telling a customer ‘Thisnew system implemented by my bank takes a very long time; please wait forupdating your pass book’ or tells ‘We have moved to a Core Banking Solution;please leave your cheque requisition slip and come back after two days forthe cheque book’ is sure enough to wreck the entire change process andimage building that the bank has ambitiously embarked upon.Having given a gist of the need to effectively manage change, let menow outline some of the areas which offer major challenges in the area oflarge scale technological upgradation.At the top of the pyramid of challenges is the choice of the righttechnological solution. Most often than not, we are guided by vendorpresentations and experiences of other organisations in the process ofselection and we end up in getting a system which may not necessarily be thePage 3 of 6best one for the bank concerned. While broad technological contours may bethe same, customisation may hold the key to providing the correct system foreach individual organisation. I am reminded of the case of a bank whichstarted installing Cash Dispensing Machines a few years ago, based on someexperiences of the West. Today, we have observed that Automated TellerMachines (ATMs) with multi-functional and regional language capabilities arebeing construed as the optimal fit for cash based and other relatedtransactions of customers.The next challenge relates to the level of security in the usage of ITbased systems in banks. Much has been said and detailed about the need forfool proof security systems in banks, but we find that security breaches andthe consequent perpetuation of frauds are also taking place. Security inbanking applications is not a feature but a built-in process. The Public KeyInfrastructure (PKI) which is positioned as a very advanced securitymechanism may be brought to nought if there is a compromise of the smartcards housing the digital signature, by the holder and he shares the card withan unauthorised person. Thus, the entire chain of procedures andcomponents of a system have to be looked at in a holistic manner to ensurethat security is all pervasive across the entire chain of activities.Another important challenge facing all of us is the need forstandardisation. While standardisation does not mean that the same uniformsystems are used across all banks, the bare minimum requirements to ensureinter-operability has to be provided for. With margins across different partnersin business thinning, it is essential that banks take up Straight Throughprocessing and Inter-operability as key issues to be addressed in all theirtechnological implementations. The usage of the SFMS of the IDRBT, it ishoped, will address this concern to a large extent. This is also a challengewhich I am sure that the IDRBT will also take up in right earnest for the benefitof the financial sector as a whole. The growth in mobile communications and the exponential usage ofmobile telephony by India’s masses is an aspect which in my view, bankshave to look upon as an opportunity to harness to their benefit. The power ofPage 4 of 6the chip in the mobile phone is enormous and its usage for secure bankingtransactions needs to be examined and provided for.I would also like to touch on another challenge which banks are slowlyovercoming. The need for regular, sustained IS audit is being highlighted bythe Reserve Bank for some time now. While some initiatives have been takenby banks towards achieving this, much more needs to be done. The speedwith which IT implementation and upgradation is being done may outpace thefrequency of IS Audit and it is in the best interests of banks that this vitalactivity is given due importance.IT also facilitates a host of other functions which banks have beenhitherto performing through manual operations. Let me take up the case ofverification of the genuineness of the customer - the Know Your Customer orKYC factor. Technology facilitates easier access to verification of informationon a real time basis. Since IT tools provide a scientific and almost real timemonitoring and analysis of funds movement, this would help a great deal inensuring compliance to Anti-Money laundering requirements. Many IT basedbanking solutions have incorporated sophisticated algorithms andcomprehensive permutations and combinations to provide alerts on a realtime basis. Such a facilitation may well be impossible using manual means.Another vital aspect that has to be taken cognisance of is thattechnological deployment must always be consistent with the levels ofexpertise in each bank as well as the nature and sophistication of itscustomers. Alternatively it is important to train all the stake holders to ensurea smooth technological transformation. Many of you must have had occasionto read the book ‘Freakonomics’ by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner. Thenarrative there on the lifetime episode of Paul Feldman on the sale of theAmerican bread - bagels is an eye opener. He commenced sale of the bagelsin an unsupervised manner which led to a situation where the buyers did notalways pay for their offtakes. Nevertheless the recovery rate was ratherencouraging. He further studied the behaviour-versus-payment patterns andcame out with correlations - such as the increased payments duringChristmas or even during pleasant weather situations while catastrophiesPage 5 of 6(such as the 9/11 event) or bad weather resulted in lesser paymentrealisations. Based on this he replanned his strategies. Banks could do well tokeep this story in their minds while planning so that their products andservices meet employee and customer requirements - all of which provideimproved results for banks in the long run.Let me now conclude on a positive note. Indian banks have proved thatIT based upgradation of banking services can be achieved within short timespans and at remarkably accurate levels. We have some of the largest corebanking implementations in the world, we have a unique network for theexclusive use of banks in the form of the INFINET; banks have their owncorporate intra-nets which are functioning effectively; we have the enablinglegal infrastructure for large scale IT deployment and able all, we have a largecustomer population which has adapted well to the changes usingTechnology. These do give us comfort, but let these not lead us tocomplacency. As India has made a place in the IT arena, it may not be longbefore we make our presence felt in an IT enabled banking world as well.Indian Banks have always risen up to challenges and have successfullyovercome them. Today’s success mantra for achieving excellence lies in theoptimal use of technology in a manner where the process of change ismanaged well enough to blend with customer expectations of excellentcustomer service. This in turn would result in better house keeping andimproved bottom lines for the banks and above all in overall systemicefficiency.My best wishes to all of you and may your efforts lead to creation of ITbased bank models of the morrow.I wish you all fruitful deliberations during the day.Thank you.Page 6 of 6
