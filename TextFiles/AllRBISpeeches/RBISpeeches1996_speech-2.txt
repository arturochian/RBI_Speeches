COMPETITION IN INDIAN BANKING:1ISSUES AND IMPLICATIONSY.V. ReddythIt gives me pleasure to deliver the valedictory address at the 19 Bank Economists’Conference 1996 being hosted by the United Western Bank. I have, with muchinterest, gone through the papers circulated by the organisers. The papers arecomprehensive and I am particularly impressed by the coverage, depth of analysisand the innovative ideas that have emerged.The rapporteurs' succinct and prompt report of the proceedings during the past twodays confirms the wide spectrum of issues that were debated and I trust thateveryone here will return enriched with ideas.Governor, Dr. Rangarajan, in his inaugural address referred to competition in anindustry as a composite of five competitive forces. All industries are characterisedby historical trends and new developments that either gradually or speedily producechanges important enough to require a strategic response from participating agents.The Indian banking industry is no exception. The rapid changes that have occurredduring the last few years in the financial sector have increased competition in thebanking industry. The issue has gained such predominance, that it warrantsbrainstorming as in this Conference.The conditions in the banking industry have changed and are changing all over theworld. In our country, economic reform and in particular financial sector reform hasaltered the atmosphere in which the participants operate.First, market size - Usually, a small market does not attract too many competitors.The size of the market is so large and with GDP likely to grow at 6.5 per cent in themedium-to long-term, the Indian banking industry has become very attractive-asnever before.Second, industry profitability-higher by the standards of the past or internationalstandards is attracting more new entrants. Hence, increasing competition in theindustry.Third, rapid technological change-This enables not only quicker and more efficientservice but advantage to new entrants over existing players.Fourth, product innovations-Features such as home banking, ATMs are all makingthe industry to be continuously alert, and fiercely competitive.Fifth, entry/exit norms-While regulatory barriers have been eased, desirable barriersexist in the form of capital and other requirements. After all banking license cannotbe like a driving license. But, entry norms are fairly clear, though exit norms are notclear yet.                                                          1 th Valedictory Address by Dr.Y.V. Reddy, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 19 BankEconomists Conference at Mahabaleshwar on December 18, 1996.Sixth, markets are increasingly getting integrated in our country also. Domestic andforeign currency, banking and non-banking are getting closer. Correspondingly,there are institutional innovations and interlinkages, both in ownership andoperations - be it in depositories or mutual funds.Seventh, consumers of banking services are getting increasingly agile, enlightened,cost and quality conscious. They are already forcing the pace of competition onprice, product and quality products.Competition does not mean that banks cannot enter into strategic alliances. Theclearing house is one form of strategic co-operation already in place. In fact, suchstrategic cooperation will give banks a competitive advantage over others. I believethat banks should forge strategic alliance without undermining competition. At thesame time, there should not be any element of cartelisation. We can readily think ofsome areas where banks can enter into strategic alliances.First, technology related, where interconnectivity would be of great advantage.Second, marketing related, such as exchange of information on credit record ofcustomers, customer guarantees, inter-bank participation, and of course,syndication.Third, organisation related, especially in dialogues with the law makers andregulators on the need for changes.In fact, the scope for self regulation should be actively explored. Perhaps, thereshould be a Conference to explore avenues for cooperation that will enhance thestrengths of banks in relation to others.Fourth, incidentally, there can be what is termed as segmented alliances also. Forexample, public sector banks can cooperate, as in fact they are doing now in somecases, to create common supporting services that will help them to captureeconomies of scale.At this stage, I would like to quickly respond to some points raised in the technicalsessions.The first technical session rightly focussed on decisive factors in competition, and itincludes Government policy. Perhaps, we should more explicitly recognise thegrowing importance of the stance of the Central Bank. A reference has been madeto the need for advance intimation on sequencing of reforms, in the context ofinternational experience. Yes, it would be useful to have a broad idea though thereare limits to transparency if anticipatory actions are to be avoided. The NarasimhamCommittee Report provided an initial framework. Pronouncements by the Governorof RBI have been indicating clearly the direction - both in monetary policy and creditpolicy.There is some truth in the statements that competition is yet to penetrate -especially in the rural segments. We believe that the concept of Local Area Bank ismeant to tackle this issue, and we feel that it will spur competitive spirit.There is some reference to duality of control between the RBI and Government -especially the State Governments in the cooperative sector. Admittedly, there areissues which affect autonomy and level playing field that arise out of the nature oforganisation, ownership, etc. governed by different laws - cooperatives ornationalised banks.In the second session, there was a reference to the increasing uncertainties andrisks emanating out of competition in banking. This is indeed an area in which wehave to improve our perceptions and professional skills. The emerging scope foruniversal banking has also been mentioned. More important, it is said thatgovernment will continue to be a major borrower. But, there should be an answer tothe question as to why banks are lending, at least now, more to the governmentthan what they need to under SLR obligations. Is it because the private borrowersdo not want to borrow at what they call high interest rates? In fact interest rates arenot high compared to sometime in the past, when the industry was worried aboutavailability of credit and not cost. Perhaps, inflationary expectations have comedown and the industry does not wasn’t to borrow at these rates. Industry also hasmore avenues for credit from non-banking sources, including the capital market.You may like to think about these.The third session made very perceptive analysis of core competencies, further stepstowards global competition and the special advantages as well as disadvantages ofvarious segments of our banks. We have to recognise the importance of transition.We have to give some reasonable time and opportunity to existing participants toequip themselves to compete on a level playing field overcoming the overhang ofthe problems of the past. Our goal is clear, viz., competition - but competition doesnot exist in a vacuum. Competition has to be ensured by the regulatory authorities.Before concluding, let me share with you what I believe are some emerging issues,though many of them have already been mentioned in the papers circulated andyour deliberations.First, the issue of competition is irrevocably linked with regulatory framework andlevel playing field. This issue has been constantly raised in different forums and thisrelates to not only banks but also to other financial intermediaries. The financialsector is still in transition and let me assure you that this is an area that will gaingreater attention in the future.Secondly, all other industries are vocal about the 100 million middle-class. Thecorporate sector is increasingly talking about exploiting the potential in the rural-semi-urban markets. Perhaps, we should question the relevance of rural-urbandichotomy and look at rural-urban continuum.Thirdly, when competition intensifies, there has to be inevitable changes such asmergers- what I earlier referred to as exit norms. As one of the Conference paperspointed out, the net result in any field is either the crowding out of the weakerplayers or their amalgamations with the stronger ones.Fourthly, in this context, banks should concentrate on study of the success storiesas well as bank failures. Internationally, there are elaborate documented studies onbank failures; Barings is just one example. We too need to make an incisiveanalysis of banks that failed in our country and learn not to commit similar mistakes.Fifthly, we have to think seriously about the nature of the control that exists. Bankswill need to be given more autonomy, and more important, they should assert theirautonomy. Here lies the importance of industry associations. The scope for self-regulatory industry norms and banking industry protocol should be explored. Thiswill bring about more flexibility to banks and less regulatory intrusion.Sixthly, I noticed a suggestion in one of the papers to make Mumbai as aninternational financial centre. Similarly suggestions have been made in the past andwe have some reservations, but we always have an open mind. A number of issueshave to be clarified in our minds - whether such a financial centre can be startedbefore we reach international standards? Whether we need to promote such acentre at this stage of financial sector reforms or at a later stage?  Please studythese issues in a more detailed and formal manner, and then we can take a view.Seventhly, there is a lot of interest from foreign entities in the opening up of theinsurance sector in India. Perhaps, both banks and policy makers need to assesswhether domestic banks, particularly larger banks, have an opportunity to enter intoeither general or life insurance through subsidiaries or collaborations, to takeadvantage of their existing market penetration. Could this really add to thecompetitive strength of the banks in financial intermediation?Friends, as we economists know, competition is not just an end in itself. It is ameans. The end result or objective is efficiency. Our objective of reform should beequalling global standards to compete effectively and soon after excelling globalstandards to make a respectable place for ourselves in the fast progressing globalfinancial sector. Other countries like Japan did it. Why not India? We have thetalent. Many sophisticated deals in London or New York are done by young Indians.We have numbers also in our favour. All we need is changing the mindset, imparttraining and bestowing serious attention to incentive structures. We in the ReserveBank of India do look forward to your suggestions. Please come up with your ideason when and how we reach and then set global standards.
