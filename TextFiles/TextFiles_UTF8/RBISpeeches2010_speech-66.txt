Lessons from the Financial Crisis for Monetary Policy in Emerging Markets    L. K. Jha Memorial Lecture    John B. Taylor    Platinum Jubilee Celebration  Reserve Bank of India  Mumbai    February 24, 2010     I am honored to give this lecture in memory of L.K. Jha.  It is a particular privilege to  deliver it at this Platinum Jubilee celebration of the Reserve Bank of India.  L. K. Jha was a truly  outstanding economist and public servant, with experience at all levels of government.  He rose  up through the Indian Civil Service to become the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, after  which he became Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and then Ambassador to the United  States and Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. He also took time to write books and serve on  important commissions, including the Willy Brandt Commission on the interdependence  between developed and developing economies. I admire how L.K. Jha worked to make good  economic policy a reality and how he focused on helping people.     I never met L. K. Jha, but I feel I have come to know him through his writings.  Two of  his books are a particular delight, in part because they are short, which is unusual for economics  books.   1  North South Debate is about policy principles.  Jha focused on the deteriorating  relationship between the developed and developing world in the 1970s.  He argued that the  confrontation was caused by the poor economic performance in the United States and other  developed countries during the Great Inflation of the 1970s.  He characterized the policy that  eventually led to the poor economic performance with a catchy phrase: it was a policy of  following Keynes at home and Adam Smith abroad (p.28), and while Jha argued that this  worked for a while, it eventually led to the high inflation and high unemployment of the late  1960s and 1970s.  But policy principles changed after that turbulent period. In my view it was a  move away from Keynes, perhaps one could say toward Adam Smith both at home and abroad,   1 L.K. Jha, North South Debate, Chanakya Publications, Delhi, 1981. 1 and we then had more than two decades of prosperity and enormous growth in much of the  developed world, including India.     I should say, especially in light of the Platinum Jubilee, that Keynes recommended the  creation of a central bank for India in his 1913 book, Indian Currency and Finance. Even if one  has doubts about Keynesian macroeconomic remedies, his original ideas in monetary economics  were sound, carefully reasoned with data and practical examples, and exposited clearly. This first  2 book of his on Indian finance is an example, and I am happy to say that it too is very short.  3  L.K Jhas  Mr. Redtape is about policy implementation.  It shows how government fails  when it loses sight of its objectiveswhich to Jha was serving the people. There is a story of  how the Indian Civil Service (ICS) in 1958 wanted to exclude some lines on a memorial stone  tablet being installed in Westminster Abbey in honor of those who served in the ICS.  The first  line of the plaque, which read, "Let them not be forgotten for they served India well," was  approved by the ICS association. But the second line, which read "They walked humbly among  the people," did not meet their approval.  In fact, they strongly opposed it, and in the end the  quote was not included.  It was an example of how the government can sometimes lose track of  the people it is serving.       These two themespolicy principles and policy implementationare the themes of my  lecture today.  I will first describe what, in my opinion, caused the recent financial crisis, and  then draw lessons for economics and for economic policy in general and monetary policy in  emerging market countries in particular.  But since the crisis began in the developed world, I  must start there and in particular in the United States.   I have been doing research on the financial crisis for a long time, at least since before the  4 crisis flared up in 2007.  My approach has been empirical. I wrote one of the first books on the  crisis, and its as short as those L.K. Jha books.  I did not focus on who said what to whom when,  however interesting and ultimately important that story is. Rather I looked at the timing of events  and at datainterest rates, credit flows, money supply, housing starts, income, consumption using statistical techniques from regressions to simple charts and focusing on what is amenable  to economic analysis.  I also tried to use the discipline of counterfactuals, or stating what  would have happened in the absence of certain events. Professor T.N. Srinivasan gives a good   2 J.M. Keynes, Indian Finance and Currency, Macmillan, London, 1913. 3 L.K. Jha, Mr. Redtape. 4 John B. Taylor, Getting Off Track, Hoover Press, Stanford, 2009. 2 example of a counterfactual which is related to L.K. Jha.  As you know L.K. Jha was the adviser  to Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.  Professor Srinivasan wonders whether, if Shastri had not  died in office, L.K. Jha might have persuaded him to follow the kind of economic reforms which  took place some twenty years later. If so, GDP might be more than it is now.    This analytical process has led to some strong conclusions. I divided my analysis of what  went wrong in the crisis into separate questions: what started it, what prolonged it, what made it  so severe during the fall of 2008.  Recall that while the initial flare-up of the crisis occurred  during the summer of 2007, it went on for more than a year and the culmination was the  incredible panic that hit in September and October of 2008.  For each question, I found that  certain government actions and interventions came to the top of the list of what went wrong.  There were other causes on the lists, of course, but the actions by government were either more  important or were catalysts or prerequisites for the other causes.        Origins of the Crisis     In my view, the crisis was precipitated by monetary excesses.  These excesses took the  form of interest rates that were held too low for too long by the Federal Reserve and some other  central banks.  The low interest rates led to a housing boom which eventually ended in a bust and  was a significant factor in the crisis. The low interest rates also were a probable factor in  excessive risk-taking as people searched for higher yields.    I used a benchmark called the Taylor rule to measure the excesses.  While I lose some  objectivity in using the Taylor rule, it does describe how monetary policy worked for nearly two  decades of good economic performance in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. The policy  systematically sought to keep inflation down and to fend off boom-bust cycles.  However,  between 2003 and 2005 the interest rate was held usually low compared to the Taylor rule, and at  levels that we had not seen since the turbulent 1970s. Of course, policy makers realized this; they  were purposely deviating from the earlier policy, perhaps trying to prevent downside risks such  as a Japanese style deflation.     You do not have to rely on the Taylor rule to come to this conclusion. Other analysts  have looked at alternative measures, including that the real interest rate was negative for an  unusually long time. I think there is growing agreement that an excessively easy monetary policy  3 was a key factor leading to the boom and thus to the bust and the crisis. The housing bust had  impacts on the financial markets as falling house prices lead to delinquencies and foreclosures.      I also tried to see if these low interest rates could be directly related to the housing boom.  Here is where the counterfactual comes in. I built a model in which I related the federal funds  rates to the housing market. I did a counter-factual simulation to find out what would have  happened if rates were not held that low, but had followed the rule that we observed, roughly  speaking, in the previous 20 years. My findings are that this severe boom would have been  attenuated and, therefore, we would not have had the severe bust.    It is important to note that the excessive risk taking and the low interest rate monetary  policy decisions are connected.  Delinquency rates and foreclosure rates are inversely related to  housing price inflation during this period. During the years of the rapidly rising housing prices,  delinquency and foreclosure rates declined rapidly.  The benefits of holding onto a house,  perhaps working longer hours to make the payments, are higher when the price of the house is  rising rapidly. When prices are falling, the incentives to do so are much less and turn negative if  the price of the house falls below the value of the mortgage. Hence, delinquencies and  foreclosures rose.    Since mortgage underwriting programs take account of the actual realizations of  foreclosure rates and delinquency rates in cross section data, the programs would have been  overly optimistic during the period when prices were rising unless they took account of the time  series correlation. Thus, there is an interaction between the monetary excesses and the risk- taking excesses.  The rapidly rising housing prices and the resulting low delinquency rates likely  threw the underwriting programs off track and misled many people.    Some have put forth alternative explanations for the origins of the crisis.  One  explanation is a global savings glut. I do not see this as a plausible explanation. Long-term  interest rates are globally determined. No matter how you think about it, there was no global  savings glut. Savings rates were high in some countries and low in other countries, but globally,  savings rates were low. In order to argue that a savings glut occurred, one must show that desired  saving was high relative to desired investment, but these desired concepts cannot be measured  very well.    Another critique of my analysis is that mortgages are based on long-term interest rates,  while the Fed sets the short rate. However, over 30 percent of mortgages at that point were  4 adjustable rate mortgages. In fact, there was a huge move into adjustable rate mortgages. That  enabled the so called teaser rates which made the adjustable rate mortgages attractive to  people. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has done a  study looking at countries that had relatively low interest rates using the Taylor rule measure.  Generally speaking, those countries had a more serious housing boom.    While I focus on monetary policy, other government actions were probable factors.  In  the United States, the government sponsored agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were  encouraged to expand and buy mortgage backed securities, including those formed with the risky  sub-prime mortgages.  Such actions should be added to the list of what went wrong.     The Year before the Panic    Why did the crisis last so long? The crisis was evident in the summer of 2007, when the  money markets started behaving strangely. In particular interest rate spreads between three  month LIBOR and the overnight federal funds rate jumped to unprecedented levels in August  2007 and remained high for over a year.    In addition to being a measure of financial stress, these interest rate spreads affect the  transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy because trillions of dollars of loans  and securities are indexed to LIBOR. An increase in the spread, holding the overnight interest  rate constant, will increase the cost of such loans and have a negative effect on the economy.  Bringing this spread down therefore became a major objective of policy, as well as a measure of  its success in dealing with the market turmoil.   I started researching this event as soon as I observed it. Using data on the interbank loan  market, I tried to determine whether the flare-up was caused by a liquidity shortage or  counterparty risk in the banking system due to defaults and expected defaults of securities on the  banks balance sheets. In other words, was the Fed providing inadequate liquidity or were banks  unwilling to lend to each other? Counterparty risk did not seem plausible to many at the time, but  that is the explanation my research led to. If you looked at measures of counterparty risk, it was  clear that counterparty risk was the culprit. Today it seems obvious.   I believe that the policy makers misdiagnosed the problem, treating it as a shortage of  liquidity rather than an increase in risk. As a result their policy interventionsand there were  manyeither delayed treatment or were harmful. For example, the Fed introduced a new term  5 auction facility (TAF) in December 2007. With this facility banks could avoid going to the  discount window if they needed to borrow.  The aim of the TAF was to reduce the spreads in the  money markets and thereby increase the flow of credit and lower interest rates.  I found that the  Feds TAF did not affect the interest rate spreads in the money markets.    There were other actions. The Fed cut rates sharply in the winter of 2007-2008.  By my  measure, again the Taylor rule, they overdid it. The result was some rapid dollar depreciation,  and oil prices went up sharply, helping bring on the recession. Thus, I think that the  governments initial reaction exacerbated the problem. Fiscal policy was also tried. The  Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was passed in February. This package sent cash totaling over  $100 billion to individuals and families in the United States; the hope was that they would have  more to spend and thus jump-start consumption and the economy.  Most of the checks were sent  in May, June, and July 2008.  As predicted by the permanent income theory of consumption,  people spent little of the temporary infusion of cash, and consumption was not jump-started.  Personal disposable income jumped at the time the checks were sent, but personal consumption  expenditures did not increase.  Formal statistical work shows that the effect was not significantly  different from zero.     The Panic   Now let us consider the panic. Why did the crisis get so much worse in the fall of 2008?   You need to go back to the Feds intervention with the investment bank Bear Stearns in March  2008.  Having worked in the U.S. Treasury during the emerging market crises and the 9/11  attacks, and having sat in rooms making decisions with little information and huge pressure, I  sympathize tremendously with the decision makers during times of crisis. When it comes to the  Bear Stearns operation, let us assume for the sake of argument that there was not much else  people could have done than intervene.  We can debate this, but lets take that decision as a  given. In the aftermath of that decision, however, regulators should have tried to clarify the  policy, telling people Here is what we think is going on, and here is what we are trying to do.  Instead, there was little discussion or explanation. It was reasonable to guess that the government  would repeat its intervention into Bear Stearns with another firm, such as Lehman Brothers.   During the six months between the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers,  regulators made little effort to articulate a strategy. It became increasingly obvious that things  6 were ad hoc. Severe damage came with the realization that there was really no policy at all. The  rollout of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) scared people with the claims that they  were confronting another Great Depression.      Understanding the events surrounding the Lehman bankruptcy is particularly important  for assessing what went wrong.  Many in government now argue that the cause of the panic in  the fall of 2008 was the failure of the government to intervene and prevent the bankruptcy of  Lehman.  This view gives a rationale for continued extensive government interventionstarting  the very next day with AIGand to proposals for a more expansive resolution process, perhaps  in the hands of a new systemic risk regulator.  However, in my view, the problem was not the  failure to bail out Lehman Brothers but rather the failure of the government to articulate a clear  predictable strategy for lending and intervening into a financial sector. This strategy could have  been put forth in the weeks after the Bear Stearns rescue, but was not. Instead market participants  were led to guess what the government would do in other similar situations. According to event  studies of spreads in the interbank market or stock prices, the government intervention was a  more likely reason for the panic than the failure to intervene with Lehman.    I am not saying that all the governments actions were inappropriate, because there were  many things that had to be done by the time the panic was underway. Nevertheless, I believe that  if government policy had been explained and had not scared everybody, then the panic would not  have occurred, or certainly would not have been as bad.  Now, more than a year after the fact and  after I did my preliminary analysis, I believe this view remains correct.    Resiliency in Emerging Markets     The panic turned the ongoing recession in the United States into a great recession and  spread quickly around the world.  The major stock indexes fell in tandem with the S&P 500.   Consumers and businesses pulled back, largely out of fear.  Exports and imports fell sharply  throughout the world, with production declines accelerating as firms cut their inventories. The  drop in exports was the major hit to emerging market economies. One cannot exaggerate the size  and speed of this shock.    The big surprise, however, was the amazing resiliency of the emerging market countries  including India in the face of these shocks. The contrast with the 1990s, when emerging markets  were suffering their own crises, was stark.  For countries such as Brazil and Turkey which were  7 in crisis as late as 2003, the difference was especially stark. Why were emerging markets so  resilient?  In my view the most important reason is that they had moved toward better  macroeconomic policies in the 1990s and they stuck to those policies during the crisis. They  were careful not to borrow in foreign countries, and here Indian regulatory policy deserves  special credit in discouraging such borrowing by Indian banks. They built up their foreign  reserves so they could intervene in the case of a big shock like they received.  They kept inflation  relatively low and were more careful with public sector deficits.     How important were the special actions taken after the crisis, such as the Keynesian  stimulus packages, in many countries? There is evidence that the impacts of the panic were  bottoming out before the packages were implemented.  If you look at indicators like investment  orders, they stopped falling in December 2008 and January 2009, when people realized this was  not a repeat of the Great Depression. Stock markets started moving up around the world in early  March 2009. My research on the impact of the 2009 stimulus package in the United States shows  that it was similar to that of the stimulus package of 2008. It had little impact. But more real-time  research in the emerging market countries is needed to see if this is a broader finding.    What about Mistakes in the Private Sector?   Of course, throughout this period there were market problems of various sorts. Mortgages  were originated without sufficient documentation or with overly optimistic underwriting  assumptions, and then sold off in complex derivative securities which credit rating agencies rated  too highly, certainly in retrospect.  Individuals and institutions took highly risky positions either  through a lack of diversification or excessive leverage ratios.     But mistakes occur in all markets and they do not normally become systemic. In each of  these cases there was a tendency for government actions to convert non-systemic risks into  systemic risks.   The low interest rates led to rapidly rising housing prices with very low  delinquency and foreclosure rates, which likely confused both underwriters and the rating  agencies. The failure to regulate adequately entities that were supposed to be, and thought to be,  regulated certainly encouraged the excesses. Risky off balance sheet operations connected to  regulated banks were allowed by regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was  to regulate broker-dealers, but its skill base was in investor protection rather than prudential  regulation. Similarly, the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision was not up to the job of regulating the  8 complex financial products division of AIG.  These regulatory gaps and overlapping  responsibilities added to the problem and they need to be addressed in regulatory reform.    Implications for Economics   The financial crisis is generating a great deal of hand-wringing and debate among  economists and others about the subject of economics.  Last summer a cover of The Economist  magazine showed a book titled Modern Economic Theory melting into a puddle to illustrate  What Went Wrong with Economics. It was the most talked about issue of the year.   Some economists are calling for a complete reformulation of economicsor for a return  to a version of the subject popular thirty years ago. They say that economics failed to prevent the  crisis or even led to it. Many of these economists have argued for a more interventionist  government policy, saying that John Maynard Keynes was right and Milton Friedman was  5 wrong. Paul Samuelson said in January of last year today we see how utterly mistaken was the  Milton Friedman notion that a market system can regulate itself This prevailing ideology of  the last few decades has now been reversedI wish Friedman were still alive so he could  witness how his extremism led to the defeat of his own ideas. Then Paul Krugman wrote an  6 article faulting modern economics (especially modern macroeconomics and rational  expectations) for bringing on the crisis. He says it focused too much on beauty over practicality  and did not recognize the need for more government intervention to prevent and cure the crisis.  His fix is to add more psychology to economics or to build better models of credit.   My explanation of the financial crisis provides no evidence of a failure of modern  economics. Rather the crisis vindicates the theory. The crisis was caused by a deviation of policy  from the type of policy recommended by modern economics.  In the case of monetary policy it  was an interventionist deviation from the type of systematic policy that was responsible for the  remarkably good economic performance in the two decades before the crisis. Economists call  this earlier period the Great Moderation because of the remarkably long expansions and short  shallow recessions. In other words, the financial crisis gives us more evidence that  interventionist government policies have done harm.  The financial crisis did not occur because   5 Interview in the New Perspectives Quarterly, Winter 2009. 6 New York Times Magazine, September 2009. 9 economic theory went wrong. It occurred because policy went wrong, because policy makers  stopped paying attention to the economics.     Implications for Policy   This explanation of the crisis suggests that the emphasis should be on proposals to reduce  the likelihood of government interventions and actions that led to the crisis.  Going forward this  means dealing with the very large budget deficits and rising government debt; scaling back or at  least not adding more Keynesian stimulus packages; exiting as fast as possible from the  extraordinary monetary policy actions which have questioned central bank credibility and  threatened their independence; and ending the bailout mentality that will take governments  further into the operations of private businesses.    Reform of financial regulation is clearly in order. Based on recent experience, closing  present and future regulatory gaps and de-conflicting overlapping and ambiguous responsibilities  would help reduce risk, especially as new instruments and institutions evolve. Examining new  instruments, looking for new risks and gaps, and making recommendations for changes in  regulations by using the ideas from conferences like this one would also help.    Some have suggested the creation of a new systemic risk regulator, either at the national  or international level.   However, it is doubtful that such a systemic risk regulator would have  prevented the current crisis. It would not have prevented the very low interest rates or the other  government actions I have described in this lecture.  Moreover, the experience during the panic  of fall 2008 raises doubts that such an agency could resolve failing private institutions without  causing more systemic risk.  It would be helpful if it could warn about the major existing  systemic risks, including the exploding debt, central banks balance sheet, and the bailout  mentality.  But groups such as the Financial Stability Board, working along with the IMF and  G20, are better suited to that role.      Another suggestion is that central banks, including emerging market central bankstake  actions to burst market bubbles in financial or other markets.  I do not think that is a good idea.  First, the lags in the effect of monetary policy will likely mean that the impact of policy will be  its greatest when the bubble is bursting only adding to the damage.  Second, the problem in the  current crisis was not that central banks failed to burst bubbles but rather that they created them.  10 If interest rates had not been held so low and we still had bubbles then such a proposal might  have merit. But that is not what happened.     Yet another reform, recently suggested by the IMF research department, is that central  banks should raise their inflation targets.  The reason is that with the two percent target in policy  rules such as the Taylor rule the interest rate would have to go negative in a severe crisis, and  this is not possible.  But in the current crisis, the Taylor rule has interest rates going close to zero  and not remaining there for long. Moreover, raising inflation targetsespecially when  government debts are rising and central banks balance sheets are expanded could easily  reduce credibility about an inflation target at all, further damaging central bank credibility.  This  would be especially inappropriate for central banks in emerging market countries.   For the most part, the policy implications of the crisis are that those central banks that  deviated from good policy should get back to what they were doing before the crisis.  They need  to earn back credibility and preserve their independence. Systematic monetary policies focusing  on a credible goal for inflation worked well in the past and they will work well in the future.  For  central banks that were following sounder policiesand here credit should be given to the  progress made in India and other emerging market central banksthey should continue to do so.  There is no reason to change.   But the crisis does reveal some potential new fault lines, largely related to the increased  globalization and international connection between financial markets, which was so evident  during the panic.  These interconnections raise questions about the impact of central banks on  each other.  In the period leading up to the crisis there is evidence that the European Central  Bank and other central banks held interest rates lower than they would otherwise be because the  Federal Reserve set its interest rate so low.  The reason, of course, is the exchange rate.  A large  gap between interest rates would cause the exchange rate to appreciate with adverse  consequences on exports. And during the panic the shock from the developed world on the  developing world was severe and central banks had to cope with this.   Is there a better way?  Making the movements in the interest rates less erratic in the  developed countries would help the emerging market countries. I note that for the most part  deviations from policy rules, such as the Taylor rule, have increased interest rate volatility, so  keeping interest rates more on track will have the added advantage of reducing their erratic  nature.  Another possibility, which I recommended before the crisis, is that we think about a  11 global target for the inflation rate, or at least a multi-country target, a G20 target perhaps.  If  there was a multi-country target and this was at least considered in the deliberations of each  central bank then there would be a smaller tendency to swing individual interest rates around by  large amounts.     Conclusion: Keynes and Smith Again   Getting the narrative about the financial crisis right is very important.  A view frequently  heard now is that the markets did it. The crisis was due to forces emanating from the market  economy which the government did not control, either because it did not have the power to do  so, or because it chose not to because of the influence of economic theories which emphasized  the advantages of free markets.   This view sees the crisis as a market failure that can and must  be dealt with by government actions and interventions.  The economic theories and the policies  implied by them must change.   The view put forth in this lecture is that largely the opposite is true. The crisis was due  more to forces emanating from government.  According to this view government interventions  caused, prolonged, and worsened the financial crisis and did relatively little to pull us out of it.   This view sees government as the more serious systemic risk in the financial system; it leads in a  different directionto proposals to get back to what was working before policy changed and  caused the crisis.    In conclusion recall L. K. Jhas phrase which I opened with. It was a policy of Keynes at  home and Adam Smith aboard that eventually led to the poor macroeconomic performance in  the 1970s.  When most countries moved to Adam Smith both at home and abroad, the twenty  year wave of progress and stability was unprecedented.  Leading up to this recent crisis and  during it we let Keynesian policies creep back in and ironically we seem to be going down the  path now of Keynes both at home and abroad.  In my view, if we learn the lessons from this  crisis, we should get back to Adam Smith at home and abroad as soon as possible.  Of course  we cannot go completely back home again. The world is different.  Policy, including monetary  policy, needs to adapt this approach to deal with increased globalization.  12
