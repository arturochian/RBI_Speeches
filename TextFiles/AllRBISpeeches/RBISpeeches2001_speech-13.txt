• •Respected Chairman, Dr. Patel, Dr. Isher Ahluwalia and distinguishedparticipants.I am here in fulfillment of a promise made to Mrs.Isher Ahluwalia some timeback to make a presentation at this prestigious institute.  Needless to say it is a privilegeto be here; and I am thankful to the organizers for giving me freedom to choose thesubject of the day.  My fascination for this subject is only about four yours old.  Dr.Rangarajan, the then Governor deputed me to attend the fourth Central Bank GovernorsSymposium in London on my way to the annual meeting of Bank for InternationalSettlements at Basle.  The broader issue of financial regulation and the contemporaryissue of single regulator had then just been decided upon in United Kingdom.  In view ofrecent interest in the subject in India, I thought that I should share my thoughts on thechoice between single and multiple regulators for our financial system. It is a greatpersonal honour to me that Dr.I.G. Patel is presiding over this session as his  scholarship,I have divided this presentation into five parts. First, the institutional structure forregulation needs to be considered with an initial broad understanding of the rationale forregulation, regulatory coverage, policy frame and the operational aspects. Second, thestructural aspects of regulation are presented encompassing the reasons for recent interestin the subject, pros and cons of single versus multiple regulators, the internationalexperience and the developing countries’ perspective. Third, the current status of theregulatory structure. Fourth, the contours of the current debate on the subject. Fifth part,the issues for consideration. It is argued that the historical context, the state ofdevelopment of financial markets and the level of skills available should be considered inmaking a choice. It is also argued that apart from single and multiple regulators, hybridarrangements can be explored to suit the requirements of our country. While change fromthe current status appears desirable, the issue is not only one of choosing an appropriatemodel, but also one of managing the process of change and sensitizing all participants tothe changing circumstances. In any case, an ideal structure by itself does not guaranteeoptimal regulation, and in any structure, coordination among all wings involved,including the Government, is critical.statesmanship, sage counsel, and outstanding leadership are admired by all of us.Between Single and Multiple Regulators of Financial System Issues in Choosing There are several theories that attempt to explain regulation in general andfinancial sector regulation in particular.  These include theory of competition forregulation and theory of regulatory capture on the one hand and public interest theoryaimed at correcting market failures on the other.  Since there are virtually no takers forfrontier capitalism, the rationale for regulation lies in the search for a public policy thatmakes markets work better, while avoiding the dangers of excessive burden by treatingregulation as a free good and the scope for regulatory capture by the few supplierscompared to the large dispersed consumers.  More generally, the objectives of regulationare to avoid monopoly power, foster competition and protect the consumer’s interest.In regard to financial regulation, however, there is a slight change in emphasis inthe objectives of regulation in the sense that the focus is on maintaining systemic stabilityand protecting the interest of the customer.  Maintaining systemic stability is importantbecause social costs of financial distress are high in the form of the contagion effect.   Awholesale customer, such as a corporate or large net worth individual, should be in aposition to have the capacity and resources to make informed choices. But, a retailcustomer, such as small saver or small borrower, cannot incur the cost of gettinginformation, acquire or employ skills to analyse, have large enough volumes to learnfrom experience, big enough portfolio to spread risks, and as such will be unequal inrelation to the financial intermediary.  Above all, economies of scale are likely inmonitoring of information on a collective basis.  In brief, the why of financial regulationshould be considered essentially in the light of the primary objectives, namely,maintaining systemic stability and giving an impression of protecting interests of theIn India the regulation of financial sector has evolved as an instrument of planneddevelopment.  In such a situation the objectives are mobilisation of savings, andallocation of investible resources mainly through public sector and or administered pricesof financial products.  There has been an implicit sovereign guarantee of maintainingsystemic stability and in the process giving an impression of protecting interests of allparticipants.  The management of the financial sector, therefore, contained a variety ofobjectives and to this end many financial institutions were nationalised (banks) or created2retail customer; and implicitly other objectives will have to be secondary.Financial Regulation(Industrial Development Bank of India or Unit Trust of India) to subserve ends ofplanned development, thus relegating the role of competition as an instrument ofefficiency to a secondary position.  Furthermore, co-ordination among the financialinstitutions took precedence over arms length relationships or checks and balances, thusintroducing what may be called a joint-family approach to financial transactions, whichThe next question is, what constitutes regulation.  Regulation in its broadest senseincludes establishing specific rules of behaviour, or regulatory aspect per se , monitoringor tracking observance of behaviour; and supervision or oversight of the compliance withspecific rules in the overall behaviour along with disincentives and penal provisions fornon-compliance. There are some arguments in favour of formally separating theregulatory aspects from supervisory aspects but the current international practice favoursthe two functions being viewed together. In this presentation, the functions are notviewed differently, and the terms regulation and supervision are used interchangeably tocover all three functions, unless otherwise indicated. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) isgenerally looked at inter alia through three angles, viz., (i) monetary authority  (ii)regulatory authority (iii) supervisory authority. It is clearly possible to separate themonetary function from the other two though such a separation between regulation andsupervision could pose problems. The impression that the supervisory function needs tobe segregated from the regulatory responsibility has been reinforced by therecommendations of the Narasimham Committee (1998) to the effect that the supervisoryfunction be removed from the central bank and be made autonomous. In operationalterms, however, supervision is an integral part of the regulatory framework. In India, insome instances, regulation, monitoring and supervision are combined with business orcommercial relationship as in the case of National Bank for Agriculture and Development(NABARD) or Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).  It is notuncommon to find such apex supervisory institutions competing or jointly financing withthe institutions that they regulate and refinance some of them as in the case of state-levelindustrial corporations.  Thus developmental objectives are pursued jointly by nationaland state-level public-sector financial intermediaries, some of which, like Industrial3undermined both the degree of transparency and the extent of accountability.Development Bank of India (IDBI) have private-shareholding also, and in the process,The obj ective of regulation may be institution based or function based or evenproduct or market oriented.  In other words, a regulator may regulate banks though banksmay involve themselves in other activities such as being an intermediary in capitalmarkets.  Alternatively, the capital market regulator may regulate all activities relating topublic issue or trading in securities whether those functions are performed by banks ornon-banks.  Similarly, all institutions which take public deposits may be regulated by oneregulator. Yet another approach is to consider regulation in terms of markets saygovernment securities, or money market or forex.   In India, capital markets andinsurance activities were regulated by Ministry of Finance till the Securities ExchangeBoard of India (SEBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA)were set up recently while Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) have recentlybegun to be regulated / supervised by RBI.  While most banks are regulated by the RBI,some are under dual control of government and RBI.  Department of Company Affairs(DCA) regulates deposit taking activities of corporates other than banks and non-bankingfinancial companies registered under companies Act, but not those which are underseparate statutes.  Thus, the object of regulation itself is susceptible to some overlap, butthe major issue in this regard relates to the regulation of banks, namely whether banksshould be necessarily treated as a separate and special group of institution for regulatorypurposes.There has been significant debate on whether banks are special, and should betreated as such.  The rapid development of capital markets, increasing importance of non-bank sources of financial intermediation and the emergence of universal banking have ledto the erosion of importance as well as uniqueness of banks as financial institutions.There are, however, three major reasons adduced for treating them as special.  First, theyare participants in the payments system and hence are the backbone of the financialsystem.  The systemic risks of any one bank being affected either on account of itsbanking operations or on account of non-banking operations are high.  Second, the bankscontract for liquid deposits to acquire illiquid assets and hence are vulnerable to liquiditycrisis.  This would underline the need for a lender of last resort.  Third, the banks are the4the distinction between regulator and participant in the business gets blurred.major service providers for retail customers and are, therefore, on a separate footing interms of consumer protection, especially since the customers of a bank are typically risk-averse.  In other words, while retaining incentive for banks to be always solvent, there isconstructive ambiguity in extending liquidity by lender of last resort.  Thus, banks,particularly those with access to payments system are generally treated as a separate classin a regulatory framework – particularly in developing countries.  In India, all banks aresubject to RBI’s regulation but the framework is not uniform in the sense that publicsector banks, cooperative banks, and private banks are governed by significantdifferences and not all of them have access to the payments system. The RBI is aregulator of banks but is also the dominant owner of the largest commercial bank.  Suchclose links were considered essential for effective coordination in financial sector as partof the early endeavours of planned development and the channeling of credit.Regulation policy should recognize and admit that the fact of regulation does notguarantee that there will be no risk of failure or insolvency of a regulated unit. In fact, azero failure system is likely to be sub-optimal. There is always a danger that peopleperceive that mere act of an entity being regulated provides a guarantee from theregulator that it is risk free to transact business with the unit. The risks arise due toseveral problems, mainly related to lack of  information. First, it is difficult to preciselyassess even for the regulator how good the internal controls in a regulated entity are on anon-going basis. Frauds that occur in connivance with the management of the bank areeven more difficult to detect if they occur between two inspections as the offsitesurveillance may not throw up this information.  Second, there is no way of perfect andcontinuous assessment of adherence to the external rules imposed by the regulator. Third,Regulation is often perceived to be a free good, available at no cost, but it is not so. Thereare costs of administering regulation; of compliance; and there are also structural costs.Excessive or inappropriate regulation can stifle efficiency, and invite problems of whatare known as moral hazard and adverse selection. It may even provide incentives for theover regulated business overtly or covertly depending on the nature of the business tomove to entities which are not so regulated. Moreover, there are savers who are willing tohave a portfolio with different degrees of risk and return and correspondingly there are5even under most prudent circumstances, there is a residual risk.investment avenues. An efficient regulatory policy should provide avenues for a spectrumof risks and rewards, make it clear that regulation by itself does not guarantee risk-freetransaction and ensure that overall benefits to the system are commensurate with theoverall costs incurred. All failures of a regulated unit do not represent failure ofregulation and a regulator cannot guarantee compensation for those affected by failuresother than those covered by deposit insurance. But, a regulator has to maintain thecredibility in terms of assurance of systemic stability and consumer protection, especiallyin terms of information availability in a timely and transparent manner particularly toretail customers. “Public policy arrangements should never eliminate the incentive forconsumers of financial services to exercise due care” (Charles Goodhart, 1998).It is useful to refer to some operational aspects of financial regulation, which impinge oneffectiveness of regulation. First, how much of regulation through supervisory armshould be externally imposed by regulator and how much should be left to marketdiscipline so as to make the behaviour of  the regulated unit consistent with regulatorsintent. Second, whether intensity of regulation is such that it is considered to be theminimum with incentive for better behaviour by the regulated unit or is regulation such asto ensure mere compliance and no more. Third, how much of regulation should be off-site and how much on-site. Fourth, how much of regulation should be incentive based,which would include disincentives. Fifth, how far do consultations with marketparticipants help enhanced efficiency and when does such consultation end up as captureof regulator by the regulated. Sixth, how much of findings of supervisory oversight be putin public domain and how much kept for communication between the regulator and theregulated. Seventh, how much of the supervisory oversight should be strictly rule basedand how much of judgment of overall compliance acceptable. Briefly stated, the answerto all these questions lies in seeking and striking a right balance. These are several issueswhich need to be addressed irrespective of the structure of regulation. Of particularrelevance to Indian conditions is the need to appreciate the difference betweenadministering law or public welfare and regulation of financial entities and also notmixing up issues between the two roles. Similarly, process of deregulation orrationalization of regulation should not imply dilution in supervision and, in fact, should6be complemented by close monitoring and effective supervision, especially adequate andFinally an optimal regulatory framework ensures both autonomy and accountability ofthe regulator. To ensure these, regulatory objectives need to be spelt out clearly and fulloperational freedom granted to achieve the objectives through exercise of powers grantedto the regulator over the regulated entities. At the same time, the regulators should be astransparent as possible and fully accountable. Accountability should no doubt be withreference to overall objectives and effectiveness. If individual actions of a regulator aresubjected to external scrutiny, there may be a preference for regulatory inaction, just as, ifindividual case of inaction is subjected to such a scrutiny, there may be superfluous oreven obnoxious regulatory actions. In brief, the credibility of a regulatory framework isenhanced by making it accountable for the overall performance in terms of well definedobjectives. In India, many of the joint family approaches are not consistent with some ofthese principles. For example, the regulator has a nominee on the board of the regulated.The Government to whom a regulator is accountable has dominant presence on the boardof a regulator, who has to exercise operational autonomy. These arrangements may givesome advantages of coordination but have also disadvantages of role-conflict leading toRecently, there has been significant attention to structural aspects of regulation. Thus, aunified regulator was announced in UK in 1997; changes have been considered inAustralia and reform has been brought about in Japan. Further, legislative changes in theUSA have to some extent diluted the compartmentalization of financial activities andregulatory framework, which had been described as “hotchpotch of different regulatorsfor different bits of financial services industry, mainly for reasons of history rather thandeliberate strategy” (The Economist, May 5, 2001). Irrespective of the actual policypreferences or reforms across the globe, the structural issue of financial regulation hasFirst, the growth of financial sector is characterised by the blurring of distinction between7banking, securities and insurance activities.recently gained attention for several reasons.Structural Aspects of Financial Regulationinadequate regulatory focus and diffused accountability.timely penal action as appropriate.Secondly, even if these institutions and activities are treated with a compartmentalapproach and even if risks are considered separable, the linkages are such that theThirdly, globalisation has resulted in multifunctional global conglomerates warrantingFinally, it is argued that banks can still be treated separately for purposes of prudentialrequirements without necessarily linking them with the central bank, whose primaryIn considering the pros and cons of single regulator or unified regulation and multipleregulators, a major issue that needs to be addressed is: should banks be supervised bycentral banks?

For example, the central bank may relax monetary policy in timesof extreme weaknesses in the banking system rather than for macroeconomic reasons. Infact, Dr.Rangarajan had stated “Therefore I feel that the responsibility of bankingsupervision being carried on to the central bank might make it more difficult in myopinion to gain the kind of independence that we are talking about” (Forrest Capie,Charles Goodhart, Stanley Fischer and Norbert Schnadt, 1994, page 357). Further, bankAssuming that one has an open mind on the issue mentioned above, the arguments inFirst, there are economies of scale for the regulator since unification may permit costSecondly, the regulated units also benefit since unification mitigates the costs whichsupervised firms with diverse activities (i.e. financial conglomerates) bear for dealingwith multiple regulators.Thirdly, accountability is enhanced since complexity of the multiple supervisory systemFourthly, regulatory arbitrage can be avoided in the case of a single regulator.

A clear exampleof this unified supervision is the Monetary Authority of Singapore.In USA, there are multiple regulators even for banks who are accountable to FederalIn India, there is a separate agency for each main sector but there are examples of avariety of combinations such as combined securities and insurance regulators (Chile,South Africa); combined banking and securities regulators (Germany, France); andcombined banking and insurance regulators (Australia, Canada). Currently, examples ofIt is also necessary to recognize that several arrangements are possible whereby the singleor multiple regulators can function while ensuring appropriate coordination, sharing offacilities, and where appropriate establishing clear cut division of responsibilities. It ispossible to readily identify four of them: (1) Unified Oversight Board which leaves theexisting structure in place but overlay it with a newly established oversight boardcomprising heads of different agencies (South Africa). (2) Unification of support serviceswhich keeps agencies as separate legal entities but provides shared infrastructure andsupport services. (3) Shared facilities with central bank which establishes unifiedsupervisory agencies as a separate agency, but have it share the support services with thecentral bank (Finland).

The guiding principles of the MoU areThe international status in regard to the regulatory structures has been reviewed by theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF, December 2000). The study notes that inapproximately half of the countries examined in a recent study, the revealed preference isfor a regulatory structure based on specialised agencies. The study shows that 35countries have separate agencies for each main sector, 3 have combined securities andinsurance regulators, 9 have combined banking and securities regulators, 13 have centralbanking and insurance regulators, 3 have unified supervision (in central bank) and 10It will be interesting to explore further the countries that adopted the unified model. Theten countries classified as having adopted this organizational form are Australia, Canada,Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Sweden, and theUnited Kingdom. In at least two cases – Australia and Canada – the regulatory structureis not fully unified, as securities regulation is conducted separately from banking andinsurance regulation. As mentioned already, in Singapore’s case, regulation has beenunified within the central bank. This leaves only seven countries that have fully unifiedregulatory agencies separate from the central bank. Over half these are in Nordiccountries. In brief, while there is a significant global interest in examining the desirabilityof unified financial sector supervision – combining banking, insurance and securitiesWhile there are only a few practitioners of unified model, it is noteworthy that almost allof them are developed economies. In examining this issue, it may be useful to considerthe organizational status of banking supervision since banking is more special indeveloping countries. The Financial Stability Institute’s publication on the subject(Occasional Paper 1), makes interesting observations : “The evidence appears to be thatthe weight of argument is moving towards the adoption of a separate unified supervisorybody within more developed economies. But does that same balance hold for emergingand transitional countries?” The publication notes that in view of the Asian crisis, “it ispossible that international pressures, e.g. through the IMF, will interact with domesticforces to lead towards better funded, more skilled and more independent supervisory11regulation, the practitioners continue to be very few so far.have unified supervision (outside central bank).accountability, transparency, no duplication and information exchange.bodies irrespective of how these are structurally organized”. The conclusion is instructive: “If so, then structure may come not to be an important issue for the conduct of bankingsupervision. Perhaps, but for the time being, the balance of argument would suggest thatin less developed and transitional economies it would be safer and better to integrateMr.Howard Davies, in the Tenth C.D.Deshmukh Memorial Lecture “InternationalFinancial Regulation : The Quiet Revolution” makes a valid point of relevance to India:“in countries where the central bank is well established as an independent institution, andwhere the interplay between the banking system and the government’s finances, perhapsbecause of state ownership, or state run programmes of lending, is close, then one can seeThe reasons for caution in advocating unified model for developing countries have beenarticulated very well by  Professor Charles Goodhart in the Eleventh C.D.DeshmukhMemorial Lecture “Whither Central Banking?”: “I doubt whether the pressures toestablish a unified, specialist, supervisory agency are quite so strong in most developingcountries. The financial system is less complex, and dividing lines less blurred.Commercial banks remain the key players. Moreover, the Central Bank in mostdeveloping countries is relatively well placed for funding, is a centre of technicalexcellence, and can maintain greater independence from the lobbying of commercial andpolitical interests on behalf of certain favoured institutions. If the supervisory agency isplaced under the aegis of the Central Bank, it should share in these benefits of betterfunding, technical skills and independence. There are too many cases of supervisorybodies, outside Central Banks, failing in such respects. For such reasons I do not believethat the case for separation, which has become stronger in developed countries, should betransposed also to developing countries”. It is, however, necessary to recognize that theremay be a variety of systems, even among developing countries. However, in most cases,systems are underdeveloped in terms of coping mechanisms (such as good governancepractices), which makes them fragile and more vulnerable. Besides, in developingeconomies, there is concentration of economic activity with few economic players. Todeal with situations from such scenario, therefore, function specific supervision may be12a stronger argument for central bank involvement in banking supervision”.banking supervision into the ambit of the Central Bank”.necessary but not adequate unless there is an institutional framework for effective overallPerhaps, one should also examine the possibility of unified supervision under centralbank itself in the case of developing countries. On this, Dr Chandavarkar, who made anoutstanding analysis of Central Banking in Developing Countries (1996) has this to state:“Although the case for the central bank’s supervisory role is, on balance, stronger, thisdoes not imply that there is necessarily a case for merger of existing autonomoussupervisory agencies with central banks, which can continue, provided there is effectiveCurrent Status in IndiaIn India, as in the case of many other countries, there are several agenciesentrusted with the task of regulation and supervision of different institutions and marketparticipants in the financial sector. While the specific objective may vary from depositorprotection and investor protection to market regulation, their common concern ismaintaining financial stability. The RBI regulates and supervises the major part of thefinancial system through its various departments. The supervisory role coversCommercial Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), Urban CooperativeBanks (UCBs) and some All-India Financial Institutions (AIFIs). Some of these AIFIs inturn regulate and/or supervise other institutions in the financial sector, viz., RegionalRural Banks (RRBs) and Central and State Cooperative Banks are supervised by the RBIthrough National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD); StateFinancial Corporations (SFCs) by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) (to betransferred to SIDBI) and Housing Finance Companies by National Housing Bank(NHB).The Board for Financial Supervision, which operates as a Committee of the CentralBoard of Directors of the RBI functions as an oversight supervisory body in respect ofbanks, NBFCs and AIFIs. It may be noted that while NBFCs have been brought under afirm regulatory framework through legal enactments, supervisory role in respect of AIFIsis of more recent origin. The AIFIs continue to be large in size but with significant directlinks with the Ministry of Finance. The RBI-NABARD relationship has many differentfacets. On behalf of the RBI, NABARD supervises the banks in the rural cooperative13coordination between the agency and the central bank”.coordination.segment, viz., the State and Central Cooperative Banks. The banks in this sector are notsupervised by the BFS. It also supervises the RRBs which are in part regulated by theRBI. The RBI currently licences and regulates Local Area Banks (LABs), which aretreated as commercial banks, but the supervisory responsibility of these is with the RBI.Statutory provisions govern the supervisory responsibilities of Housing FinanceCompanies by NHB and SFCs by IDBI /SIDBI.The Registrars of Cooperatives (ROC) of different states are a joint regulator for thebanks in the cooperative sector, both urban and rural. (For multi-state institutions, theCentral ROC under the Ministry of Agriculture is the main regulator). WhileRBI/NABARD are concerned with the banking function performed by them, themanagement control rests with the State/Central Governments. This dual control impactsthe supervision of both RBI and NABARD over institutions in this sector.SEBI regulates the capital markets and supervises several institutions such as the StockExchanges, Mutual Funds and other Asset Management Companies, securities dealersand brokers, Merchant Bankers and Credit Rating Agencies.

Narasimham) hadstrongly recommended that the “duality of control over the banking system between theReserve Bank and the Banking Division of the Ministry of Finance should end and thatthe Reserve Bank should be the primary agency for the regulation of the banking system”(pp.130). Thus, the supervisory function of banks (and other financial institutions) washived off to a separate authority as an autonomous body under the aegis of the ReserveBank. The BFS was constituted in 1994 with the Governor, RBI as Chairman. Theconcept of a Super Regulator was raised in the Report of the Working Group forHarmonising the Role and Operations of DFIs and Banks (Chairman : S.H.Khan). TheGroup recommended as one of the options, the establishment of a Super Regulator tosupervise and coordinate the activities of the multiple regulators in order to ensureuniformity in regulatory treatment. The Discussion Paper on the subject released by theRBI in January 1999 observed that the question whether the supervisory responsibilityshould lie solely with the BFS or with a separate supervisory system to be devised for thepurpose would need to be considered in due course.The Report of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms, (April 1998)(Chairman:M.Narasimham) recommended restructuring of the existing BFS. TheCommittee recommended that an integrated system of regulation and supervision be putin place to regulate and supervise the activities of the banks, financial institutions andNBFCs. It also recommended that the RBI Act Section 58 should be amended to enablethe RBI Central Board to frame regulations to set up a separate and distinct Board for15themselves, and above all the accountability to Parliament through the Ministry.Financial Regulation and Supervision (BFRS).

The limitations of the legal process have also come inthe way even where corrective action like removal of the incompetent management isThe Advisory Group on Securities Market Regulation, May 2001 (Chairman Mr.DeepakParekh) also referred to the diffusion of regulatory responsibilities when it stated “Theregulatory responsibility of the securities market is vested in the SEBI, the RBI and twogovernment departments – Department of Company Affairs and Department of EconomicAffairs. Investigative agencies such as Economic Offences Wing of the government andconsumer grievance redressal forums also play a role”. It is interesting to note thesuggestion made by the Deepak Parekh Group for greater coordination in regulationthrough the High Level Group on capital Markets (HLGCM) :. “There may be merit informalizing the HLGCM by giving it a legal status. Besides, the HLGCM needs to meetmore frequently and its functioning needs to be made more transparent. Also, a systemneeds to be devised to allow designated functionaries (not necessarily only at the toplevel) to share specified market information on a routine and automatic basis”. Thisrecommendation relating to giving a legal status to the HLGCM is in consonance to whatcame to be described as the Reddy Formula for handling the regulatory gaps andThere have been several suggestions for improvements in regulatory mechanisms throughtechnical papers and reports of working groups in RBI. For example, the Technical Paperon Regulation of Debt Markets prepared by RBI and submitted to Ministry of Finance in16overlaps.contemplated".soundness of the financial system.1999 considered issues of concern, an overview of money and securities markets, existingregulatory framework, review of international practices and made severalrecommendations. As a follow up of one of the recommendations, the Government ofIndia issued notification under Section 29 A of the Securities Contract Regulations Actformally demarcating clearly the regulatory jurisdiction over money, and governmentsecurities markets. The proposed Clearing Corporation is yet another follow up of theseRecognising the criticality of formal coordination and information exchange mechanismsbetween RBI and other agencies, an internal Study Group was set up in 1998 to suggestan institutional framework for inter-agency coordination as part of the exercise ofbridging gaps in compliance with Basle Core Principles. The Group had recommendedthat formal arrangement for sharing of information to be put in place between domesticregulators and as a first step, a Group drawn from RBI, SEBI, NHB, IRDA, NABARDand DCA could identify areas of concerns. It also recommended that a shared data base toserve the information needs between regulators and enforcement agencies be put in place,The Report of the Group had been considered by the BFS of RBI which had taken theview that the Ministry of Finance should be asked to form a Technical Group to look intosharing of data between regulators. Each agency should outline what data it collects andwhat data it can share, which data is confidential and which is not, which data is collectedon a routine basis and which by request. The BFS also indicated that this TechnicalGroup could be a Standing Group and should be assigned all residuary work includingformation of an agency for data collection and sharing. The BFS expressed thatNABARD/NHB need not be part of the Group as they perform delegated supervision asagents of RBI. Regarding the information sharing between investigative agencies, it wassuggested that the Technical Group could also look into this aspect after both the ForeignExchange Management Act (FEMA) and Money Laundering Bills are passed.Accordingly, RBI took up the subject with Government in March 1999. These issueshave been considered in different discussions held in the Government on topics such asthe setting up of a Serious Frauds Office (SFO), introduction of Suspicious ActivitiesReporting (SAR) and the setting up of a Credit Information Bureau. It is hoped that the17administered through an agency set up on the lines of FINCEN of USA.recommendations.information sharing between investigative agencies and SAR would be revisited after theIn the context of the recommendations of Advisory Group on Securities MarketRegulation (Chairman : Mr.Deepak Parekh), a reference was made to Reddy Formula,which represents the approach articulated in several speeches since 1997, and in greaterdetail in August 1999. The proposal was made after elaborating on the need forconsidering five features of institutional structure for regulation in India, and the need fora review. The proposal read as follows : “Since there is no point in creatingbureaucracies, there are practical difficulties in massive redeployment of personnel, andexpertise for regulation cannot be created overnight, some ways for filling up theregulatory gaps and overlaps should be found without disrupting the existing regulatorystructures. I would propose that it is necessary to explore the feasibility of an umbrellaregulatory legislation which creates an apex regulatory authority without disturbing theexisting jurisdiction. The features of the idea are : The BFS of the RBI  can continue tosupervise banks and non-banks but with the Deputy Governor as Chairman : theinsurance regulating authority will supervise insurance companies and SEBI willcontinue with its regulatory jurisdiction. The apex financial regulatory authority may beconstituted by statute with the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India as Chairman andthe members could be Chairmen of the three regulatory agencies. The apex body shouldalso include some outside experts on a part time basis. Finance Secretary could be apermanent special invitee or  a regular member without voting rights as in the case of theRBI Board. The apex authority could have by law, jurisdiction to assign regulatory gapsto one of the agencies; arbitrate on regulatory overlaps and ensure regulatorycoordination. The apex authority could be serviced by a part-time secretariat of the RBI.In a way the proposal improves and formalizes the present informal arrangement into alegislative based authority. The idea could be debated as one of the options for regulatoryreform” (Corporate Governance in Financial Sector, 1999).  Dr.R.H.Patil, Chairman ofthe Advisory Group on Corporate Governance too expressed his preference to what healso described as Reddy Formula. A legitimate question in this regard is the justificationfor Governor RBI to be the Chairman, even assuming that he/she is disassociated fromsupervision of banks. It will be appreciated that every transaction irrespective of the18agency to administer the proposed Money Laundering Legislation is identified.market in which it takes place, has one leg in the cash/interbank market in terms ofultimate payment/settlement. Any problem in the market in which the transaction takesplace has to impact the cash market. The RBI as the ultimate provider of liquidity (thoughmay not be as regulator) has, therefore, to concern itself with the stability in thefunctioning of all financial markets. The case for the Governor of the RBI to be theChairman of the apex financial regulatory authority rests on this overall responsibility onthe part of RBI.The regulatory and supervisory arrangements of institutions broadly under the aegis ofthe RBI are being reviewed to differentiate between financial intermediaries that are partof the payments system (in view of the criticality for systemic stability); that arecooperative in character (emphasizing voluntary participation and collective managementand where appropriate retail depositors interests); and others which are intermediarieswith primarily commercial orientation (other DFIs, NBFCs, etc. some of which havesystemic implications while many, though not all mobilise retail deposits). A TechnicalPaper under preparation in the RBI on this subject will be finalised soon afterThe elaborate treatment accorded to the issues relevant to choice between singleand multiple regulators brings out conclusions on somewhat expected lines. The subjectneeds to be viewed in the context of a country and the circumstances, especially theinstitutional history. The choice should not be made as a measure of “doing something”to meet pressing demands. The choice need not be made in extremes of single andmultiple regulators since there are possibilities of hybrids and supplementingarrangements. Under any system, issues of information exchange and coordination areinevitable. In the final analysis, the regulatory objectives, coverage, skills, operationaleffectiveness and credibility are important and structures remain one element of financialregulation. In the Indian context, considering the current status and debate, a few issues19First, should the subject be addressed now?could be raised.Issuesconsultations with all concerned.The answer is obviously yes. Dr.Bimal Jalan in his Monetary and Credit PolicyStatement of April 19, 2001 stated “The recent experience in equity markets, and itsaftermath, have thrown up new challenges for the regulatory system as well as for theconduct of monetary policy”. Further, Mr.S.Subramanyam (The Hindu Business Line,April 5, 2001) urged : “The earlier the government thinks about this far-reaching issue ofregulatory reforms, the better it will be for the accelerated growth of the financialservices industry”. Moreover, definitive suggestions have also been offered, as forexample, by Mr. Tamal Bandyopadhyay  (Business Standard, April 7, 2001) “Since theliquidity support has to come from the RBI – the lender of the last resort – to ward offany crisis, ideally RBI should be made the super regulator. However, before assumingthis role, the central bank must put its house in order”.The answer is not easy but clearly there are many areas of the regulatory system that needattention. Focusing entirely on regulatory structures may not be an adequate response tothe current weaknesses, the changes needed in the objectives and coverage of regulation,and the emerging challenges for higher growth as well as greater  openness in externalsector. Perhaps, the debate has to go beyond the single or multiple regulators, or hybridarrangements, while recognizing some urgency for putting in place effectiveThird, what appears to be the major areas for immediate attention in regard to financialWhile it is difficult to be precise or comprehensive, the presentation made today invitesattention to the need for clarity on regulation policy. The rationale, the scope, the limitsthe objectives and the instruments ought to be clarified to the extent possible since thereis a paradigm shift in the role of the financial sector in economic growth and social Expectations of public from regulation ne ed to be clearly appreciated and ifnecessary moderated.
