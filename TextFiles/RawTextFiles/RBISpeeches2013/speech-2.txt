Economic and Financial Developments in Mizoram
I am happy to be in this picturesque state of Mizoram, the land of rolling hills, 
valleys, rivers and lakes. The state has a strategic location as it shares much of its 
border with Bangladesh and Myanmar.  It covers 0.6 per cent of the national 
geographic area and accounts for 0.1 per cent of national population. With second 
highest literacy rate in the country, the state has great potential for economic 
development. 
 Access to finance is an important prerequisite for economic development. In 
the recent years the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has pursued the objective of 
financial inclusion with renewed vigour. Some progress has been achieved but there 
are miles to go. Governor  Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan has emphasised financial inclusion 
as one of the five pillars of the RBI’s financial development plank : “… to expand 
access to finance to small and medium enterprises, the unorganised sector, the poor, 
and remote and underserved areas of the country, though technology, new business 
1
practices and new organisational structure.”  Financial inclusion poses additional 
challenges in the north-eastern states given the relatively low level of banking 
penetration and inadequate infrastructure. Against this background, I briefly delineate 
the economic and financial structure of the state, highlight our financial inclusion 
initiatives and conclude with some thoughts on policy challenges on the way forward. 
Economic Structure 
 India experienced accelerated GDP growth rate in the 2000s. Obviously, this 
growth experience was shared by many states. In line with the national economy, 
Mizoram also experienced pick up in its growth. Even as the growth momentum at the 
national level was dented following the onset of global financial crisis in 2007-08, the 
performance of Mizoram’s economy was better even in the post-crisis period.

 Consequently, the share of Mizoram’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) in the all-
India GDP rose from 0.08 per cent in 2006-07 to 0.10 per cent during 2011-12     
(Chart 1).

 All the three major sectors of the economy– agriculture, industry and services - 
contributed to the improved growth performance of the state. There was, however, 
significant year-to-year fluctuation in sectoral growth rates. While variation in 
agricultural growth is understandable being weather dependent, volatility in industrial 
growth needs closer attention, given the low industrial base of the state (Chart 2).

  The sectoral composition of the Mizoram economy has broadly changed in line 
with the national economy with declining share of agriculture and increasing share of 
services. While the share of industry has picked up, it remains significantly below the 
national average underscoring the scope for further industrialisation (Chart 3).

 The most significant impact of growth has been improvement of per capita net 
state domestic product (NSDP) from 26,308 in 2006-07 to 39,546 in 2011-12 at 
2004-05 prices, despite a larger decadal population growth rate of 22.8 per cent, which 
is higher than the rate of growth at 17.6 per cent at the national level. Notably, per 
capita income of Mizoram was about 4.0 per cent higher than the corresponding 
average national per capita income during 2011-12 (Chart 4).

  It is worthwhile to note that while the economy of Mizoram, in line with the 
national trend, is getting increasingly dominated by industry and services sectors, 
labour force is still concentrated in the agricultural sector (Table 1). Therefore, 
creating employment opportunities in the manufacturing and services sectors has 
become important.

 A higher proportion of working age (ages 15-59) population in rural Mizoram 
as compared to rural India provides a favourable condition for growth (Chart 5). But 
for this to happen, industry and services sectors should increasingly provide the 
employment opportunity.

 Social Indicators 
 With greater urbanisation and higher literacy, indicators of human development 
in Mizoram are better than the national average (Chart 6).

 Share of households having access to the basic amenities like electricity, 
television, computers, telephones and four wheelers are significantly higher in 
Mizoram than the national average (Table 2). On the other hand, proportion of 
population having access to banking facilities, although improved during the decade 
2001-2011, was below the national level. This is a policy challenge in the context of 
development with increasing emphasis on financial inclusion.

State Finances 
 Mizoram is one of the 11 special category states which are characterised by 
low resource base and the cost disabilities due to their geography, sparse terrain and 
remoteness. In order to overcome these inadequacies, the Centre accords special 
consideration in devolving resources from the central pool. 
 The revenue account of Mizoram showed significant improvement following a 
rule-based fiscal policy under Mizoram FRBM Act 2006. However, the correction in 
revenue account was largely on account of higher transfers from the Centre, since own 
tax revenue continued to remain around 2.3 per cent of GSDP. From the perspective 
of growth and employment, a key concern is the decline in capital outlay in terms of 
GSDP (Table 3).

Banking Developments 
 The banking sector penetration in Mizoram may be seen in the context of its 
special characteristics of difficult terrain and economic structure. Agriculture is 
characterised by hill and mountain cultivation and industry is dominated by micro and 
small units. The population per bank branch in Mizoram declined from 11,400 in June 
2001 to 9,100 by June 2013 and thus was much lower than the all-India average of 
11,800 (Chart 7) reflecting better coverage of banking services.

  However, Credit-Deposit (C-D) ratio remained significantly lower than the all-
India average (Chart 8). Moreover, C-D ratio in Mizoram has declined in the more 
recent years. It could partly be that deposits have grown faster.

 The annual deposit growth rate of Mizoram was significantly higher than the 
national average. However, the credit growth rate has fallen short of the national 
average after 2007-08 (Chart 9). This underscores the need for a deeper analysis of 
credit information: Is it lack of demand or lack of supply which is constraining credit 
flow?

  The lower credit flow is also mirrored by credit to GDP ratio which is another 
measure of financial deepening. The credit-GSDP ratio in Mizoram has improved 
more modestly from 13.7 per cent in 2004-05 to 18.7 per cent in 2011-12, as 
compared to the increase from 39.0 per cent to 57.3 per cent at the national level 
(Chart 10).

Financial Inclusion  
 The Reserve Bank is committed to Financial Inclusion (FI) so that the banking 
services touch every section of our society. It is imperative to bring the poor and 
under-privileged section of population under the banking fold for inclusive growth 
and development. In this regard, the Reserve Bank has adopted a structured approach 
towards financial inclusion predominantly through a bank-led model by leveraging 
appropriate technology, changing the mode of delivery and increasing financial 
literacy. In this context, I may highlight four key elements. 
 First, ensuring branch expansion in the rural areas by giving full freedom to the 
banks to open branches in villages. In fact, recently the branch authorisation policy 
has been fully liberalised subject to banks opening at least 25 per cent of their 
branches in the rural areas. In addition, the Reserve Bank has enabled commercial 
banks to operate through their Business Correspondents (BCs) thus taking banking to 
the door step in the rural areas. 
9 
  Second, for providing universal coverage and facilitating Direct Benefit 
Transfer (DBT) by leveraging Aadhar identification, banks have been advised to draw 
up their Financial Inclusion Plans (FIPs) for the period 2013-16 with greater emphasis 
on opening of branches in unbanked rural centres. 
 Third, provision of suitable financial products aimed towards the vulnerable 
section of population such as no-frill account, credit through General Credit Card 
(GCC) and Kisan Credit Card (KCC).  Moreover, Know Your Customer (KYC) norm 
required for opening of a bank account has been relaxed especially for rural and 
under-privileged population. 
 Finally, efforts are made towards spread of financial literacy including internet 
based curriculum for financial literacy in schools and organising financial literacy 
camps. 
 In this direction, banks have covered all the unbanked villages with population 
over 2,000. The second phase of this movement aims to achieve the target of financial 
inclusion in about 4,90,000 villages with population less than 2,000. The identified 
villages have been allotted to various banks to ensure availability of at least one 
banking outlet in each village. The detailed achievement in the recent financial 
inclusion drive is summarised in Table 4.

Progress of financial inclusion in Mizoram 
 Keeping in mind the topographic challenges and locational disadvantages for 
the development of extensive banking outreach, banks have been advised to adopt 
special measures for FI in the north-eastern region of India. Since December 2009, the 
domestic scheduled commercial banks in the country, excluding RRBs, were 
permitted to open branch in any location in the region without taking permission from 
the Reserve Bank. Let me now turn specifically to progress of financial inclusion in 
Mizoram. 
11 
 As a part of the Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) adopted in Mizoram, all the  
unbanked villages in the state with population of 2,000 or more have been covered by 
banking facility by end-March 2012. Another 700 villages having population below 
2,000 have already been identified.  Out of these villages, 106 have been proposed to 
be covered through brick and mortar model while rest would be covered through 
Business Correspondence (BC) model. 
 As at end-September 2013, there were 2, 27,812 Basic Saving Bank Deposit 
Accounts (BSBDAs) in Mizoram, while another 10,777 such accounts with overdraft 
facilities are targeted to be opened during the year 2013-14.  In addition, 11,642  KCC 
and GCC are targeted to be provided to the households during 2013-14. Out of the 8 
districts in the State, so far 5 financial literacy centres (FLCs) have been opened. As 
of   end-September 2013 cumulatively 3,063 Self Help Groups (SHGs) were credit-
linked and have been provided with total credit of `1,650 lakh.   
Policy Challenges 
 Mizoram economy has performed well in the recent years. However, keeping 
in view the young population and high literacy and strategic location, there is 
considerable scope for growth and development. Let me conclude by drawing 
attention to a few challenges.  
 First, the dominant feature of the hill and mountain farming in Mizoram is 
sloping marginal farmlands under rain-fed farming. Subsistence farming on these 
lands is pervasive. Expansion of land for cultivation in an environmentally sustainable 
manner may be limited. The emphasis in agriculture, therefore, may shift towards high 
value added horticulture for which there is tremendous potential. This will also require 
greater penetration of credit in agriculture.  
 Second, industrial development in Mizoram started late in the 1990s, mainly 
after attaining statehood. The industrial landscape is dominated by micro and small 
industries. There is a need to reinforce this process by facilitating access to markets 
and formal credit.  
12 
  Third, weak market linkages with the rest of India coupled with lack of good 
quality road and absence of railway network inhibits the effective marketing of goods. 
Therefore, priority should be given to the development of infrastructure, especially 
roads and also provision of post harvest management, cold storage and processing 
facilities. There is also the need to further harness the hydro-power capacity. Better 
accessibility will also help develop the services sector, particularly tourism, which 
could become a significant source of employment and revenue.  
 Finally, the topography of the state and infrastructure bottlenecks together 
work as a deterrent for the development of physical banking and financial 
infrastructure. Hence, greater reliance may need to be placed on technology to make 
banking more accessible to the majority of the population. This will require 
improvement in telecommunication facility. 
 I thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts on financial inclusion in the 
state. Tomorrow, I hope to see some of you at our outreach programme at Tanhril 
village. With the combined effort of state administration, banks and the Reserve Bank 
 
we could together make a significant impact in financial inclusion.
