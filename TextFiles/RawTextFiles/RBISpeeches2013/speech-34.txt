Interest Rates and Economic Activity
  
I thank Ms. Preeta Misra, Director & Member Secretary, Association of 
Financial Professionals of India (AFPI) for this opportunity to interact with 
distinguished professionals of corporate India. In the recent period, there has been 
an animated debate on the role of interest rates in influencing real economic 
activities. In particular, the discussion has been on how a change in policy interest 
rate impacts the lending rates, and thereby industrial performance and overall 
economic activity. In this context, the last decade through 2012-13 has been 
eventful with rapid changes in the monetary policy stance responding to the 
evolving growth-inflation dynamics. This is a period in which we recorded one of 
our highest output growth rate as also one of the lowest. Inflation showed 
significant variation. We also experienced the global financial crisis, the adverse 
effects of which are still lingering.  
As you know, Indian economy is currently passing through a very 
challenging phase: growth has slowed; though wholesale price inflation has come 
down consumer price inflation remains close to double digits, and financial market 
volatility has increased. A major factor in the recent growth slowdown is a 
significant deceleration in private corporate investment. Since you are the key 
professionals taking investment decisions, I thought it will be relevant to discuss 
how does monetary policy decisions, through interest rate changes, affect 
investment decisions and thus economic activity? Another motivation for this 
subject is that colleagues in the Reserve Bank have done substantial research in this 
area and a paper entitled “Real Interest Rate Impact on Investment and Growth: 
What the Empirical Evidence for India Suggests?” was placed in the public 
1
domain. I will urge you to look at that paper so that it generates further research 
and discussion.

 Against this background, my presentation will be as follows: I will briefly 
review the stance of monetary policy and economic outcome during the last decade 
through 2012-13; discuss monetary transmission with a focus on the interest rate 
channel; and examine the impact of interest rate changes on economic activity both 
at the macro and micro levels. 
Changes in monetary stance 
In the last 10-year period from 2003-04 to 2012-13, monetary policy 
response can be broadly categorised into four phases based on growth-inflation 
outcome and the rapidly changing monetary policy response:  
• Phase I of 5 years of 2003-08 of high growth but rising inflation concern 
towards the later part of the period when repo rate was raised from 6 per 
cent to 9 per cent and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was raised from 4.5 
per cent to 9 per cent.  
• Phase II of 2 years of 2008-10 following the global financial crisis when 
the repo rate was reduced from 9 per cent to 5.25 per cent and CRR was 
reduced from 9 per cent to 5.75 per cent. 
• Phase III of 2 years of 2010-12 of monetary tightening responding to 
rising inflation when policy rate was raised from 5.25 per cent to 8.5 per 
cent but CRR was reduced to 5.5 per cent.  
• Phase IV of over a year of monetary easing in 2012-13 and 2013-14 so 
far with the repo rate reduced to 7.25 per cent and CRR lowered to 4.0 
per cent; though since mid-July 2013, the RBI has tightened the 
monetary and liquidity conditions without changing the policy repo rate 
and CRR to address exchange market volatility.  
Monetary policy stance in any particular phase is generally conditioned by 
the growth-inflation balance, the outlook for growth-inflation in a forward looking 
context and an assessment of macroeconomic risks. Essentially, monetary policy 
aims at attaining high growth in a non-inflationary manner. But at times high 
growth in excess of potential growth could trigger inflation putting the sustainability 
2 
 of the very growth path to risks. Hence, monetary policy tends to do a careful 
balancing act so that it is not too accommodative of growth in excess of its potential 
and at the same time not too stimulative of inflation. However, there could be 
periods of rising inflation and falling growth below its potential. This could arise 
from several sources such as the lagged impact of policy stimulus from earlier 
phases and adverse supply shocks, both domestic and external, which persist.   
The challenge of rebalancing growth and inflation is evident from the four 
phases of growth-inflation presented in Table 1 and Chart 1. In the first phase, high 
growth coincided with low inflation. However, towards the latter part of the period 
as inflationary pressures rose it warranted monetary tightening. In the second phase, 
reflecting the impact of global financial crisis, growth decelerated and weak 
commodity prices globally and relatively stable exchange rate contained inflation. 
That created the space for monetary easing. In the third phase, India recovered 
ahead of the global economy, and actual growth in 2010-11 at 9.3 per cent exceeded 
significantly the post-crisis estimated potential growth of 7.5-8.0 per cent. With a 
sharp recovery in growth, inflation too caught up rapidly, partly complicated by a 
rebound in global commodity prices. The anti-inflationary thrust of monetary policy 
became unavoidable to contain inflation and anchor inflationary expectations.

In the fourth phase, softening of inflation created space for monetary easing. 
However, growth is yet to pick up reflecting both weak global demand, domestic 
supply constraints and slowdown in corporate investment. In this context, the role of 
monetary policy has also come to the fore: the question being to what extent 
monetary policy has played a role in the growth slowdown?  Let me try to address 
this issue.

 Monetary policy transmission 
 While there is considerable attention even to small changes in policy interest 
rate, the question is: does this really matter? The response to this question lies in an 
assessment of how does this policy rate changes affect market rates, particularly the 
cost of credit, and ultimately impacts the investment and consumption decisions of 
economic entities. Apart from market rates, expectations about future outcomes play 
an important role. There could also be transmission lags. Moreover, the magnitude 
of change in market interest rates may be different, ranging from money market 
rates to lending rates.  
 While policy rate changes do matter, it is not that straight forward as to how 
they impact lending rates in the transmission chain. In this context, how policy rate 
changes, impact bank deposit rates become important as banks rely on cost plus 
pricing of their loan products. Apart from cost of deposits, banks also load a risk 
premium which may change in different phases of the business cycle, and therefore, 
the lags could be longer. Hence, how fast the banks are able to change these 
parameters would largely determine the changes in their lending rates. Thus, 
nominal lending rate determination in the market is a complex process, and how 
changes in lending rates impact overall growth is even more uncertain. This is the 
2
reason why monetary policy transmission is often dubbed as a “black box”. Hence, 
explaining monetary transmission is a constant challenge for every central bank.  
Let me now turn to the issue of transmission of monetary policy in India. In 
the last few years, there have been several empirical studies, examining the interest 
rate channel of monetary transmission. The general conclusion from these studies is 
that increases in policy rate have a statistically significant negative impact on output 
and moderating impact on inflation. However, the negative effect of a policy rate 
increase is first felt on output before the moderating impact on inflation. The lags in

Transmission”, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 9, 27 – 48.

 policy rate changes on output are 2-3 quarters and on inflation 3-4 quarters. The 
3
total impact on policy change could, however, linger for 8-10 quarters .  
A notable feature of monetary policy transmission in India is the asymmetry 
one observes during different phases of a monetary policy cycle. Usually, during a 
phase of rising policy rate, banks may be  quick in raising their lending rates while 
in a phase of falling policy rate, banks may be  slow in reducing their lending rates 
as cost of deposits does not adjust commensurately given the fixed nature of deposit 
contracts. This pattern reflects that loans, being mostly at variable rates, can be re-
priced at a quicker pace than the fixed rate bank deposits.   
The asymmetric transmission also needs to be seen in relation to overall 
liquidity conditions. For example, in a tight liquidity condition, even if the policy 
rate is reduced banks may not be in a position to reduce deposit rates and hence 
lending rates with the apprehension of losing deposits.  There could be other 
considerations for not lowering deposit rates if rates of return in competing products 
such as small savings and mutual funds are more attractive. Another consideration 
in a falling interest rate scenario could be that banks might want to protect their 
profit margin through a more sluggish adjustment of their lending rates.  
Notwithstanding various complexities, the interest rate channel of monetary 
transmission has been evident over the monetary policy cycles in the recent years. 
The policy interest rate changes did impact the market interest rate in the same 
direction, though at varying intensity. The magnitude of changes in lending rates, 
however, more closely followed the changes in deposit rates (Table 2).

Nominal or real interest rate? 
Another aspect of monetary transmission is whether it is the nominal interest 
rate or the real interest rate that can influence growth and investment. In the 
literature, the stance of monetary policy is judged as loose or tight depending on the 
level of real policy rate. Most economists believe that it is the real interest rate that 
4
could  influence real economic activity. However, as individuals and corporates we 
take economic decisions looking at the nominal rates as these are the rates that we 
can observe. Is it that these are two distinct concepts? I do not think so. 
Notwithstanding apparent differences, is it not that at the back of our mind there is 
no inflation metric while planning an investment project, howsoever different it may 
be for different entities? Is it not a fact that a negative real interest rate favours 
debtors whereas a positive interest rate favours creditors?

 The link between the real interest rate and nominal interest rate is provided 
by the famous Fisher equation which postulates that the nominal interest rate is the 
5
sum total of a real interest rate and expected inflation. One implication of this is 
that the nominal interest rates should move in tandem with inflation. In the real 
world, nominal interest rates may not change one for one with the inflation rate but 
the direction more often is similar.  Countries with higher inflation tend to have 
higher nominal interest rates than countries with lower inflation. Accordingly, the 
nominal interest rates in advanced countries tend to be lower than in emerging 
market and developing countries.  
 While the notion of a real interest rate poses conceptual difficulties, the 
compilation of a real lending rate is even more difficult. It involves two steps: first 
to compute an effective nominal lending rate, and second to deflate it with an 
appropriate inflation metric. In our context, while the base rates of banks generally 
provide the floor to their lending rates actual borrower specific lending rates are 
different.  Estimates of weighted average lending rate (WALR) of banks both in 
nominal and real terms are presented in Chart 2. The real rates are obtained by 
deflating the nominal rates by the annual average wholesale price inflation.

real rates declined because of increase in inflation

During the period of the high growth phase of 2003-08, WALR of all 
scheduled commercial banks stood at 12.4 per cent, which dropped to 11.0 per cent 
during the crisis period of 2008-10. Subsequently, it went up and has remained 
around 12 per cent thereafter (Chart 3). WALR in real terms declined sharply from 
6.9 per cent in the high growth phase of 2003-08 to 5.0 per cent in the crises period 
of 2008-10. It fell further to 2.7 per cent during 2010-12 period and then went up to 
4.8 per cent in the subsequent period. Despite stickiness in the nominal interest rate, 
the reduction in the real rate was higher as inflation on an average turned out to be 
higher.  However, in 2012-13 as inflation showed a significant moderation the real 
lending rate has risen.    
Why did the investment growth slacken despite moderation in real lending 
rates? In this context, let me now turn to micro-level corporate finance data of a 
6
fairly large diversified sample. The analysis shows that interest cost as a ratio of 
sales went up from 2.6 per cent in the high growth phase of 2003-08 to over 3 per 
cent during the crisis period of 2008-10.  However, during this period the average 
sales growth declined from about 21 per cent per annum to 15.7 per cent.  Following 
subsequent recovery to 19.5 per cent per annum, it has plummeted to 9.5 per cent in 
2012-13.  Consequently interest cost to sales ratio rose to 3.8 per cent. It will thus 
seem that deceleration in sales growth has accentuated the interest burden on the 
corporates at the micro level.  
The Reserve Bank study I cited earlier suggests that for 100 basis point 
increase in real interest rate, investment rate may decline by 50 basis points and real 
GDP growth may moderate by 20 basis points. As indeed the real interest rate has 
moderated in the post-crisis period, it should not have had a large negative impact 
on investment, but for significant deterioration in the prospects of return on 
investment driven by non-monetary factors.

Decline in Marginal Efficiency of Capital 
In this context, let me turn to the investment decision at the firm level. This 
is an area in where you are better informed than me.  At the firm level, investment 
decisions may be driven by a comparison of the internal rate of return (IRR) with 
7
the hurdle rate.  As long as interest rate is lower than IRR, additional investment 
may continue. While IRR is seen in nominal terms, marginal efficiency of capital 
(MEC) which is measured in real terms plays an important role.  In a phase of 
sustained slowdown in economic growth, non-monetary factors may lower MEC 
faster than the extent to which interest rate may decline. As a result, despite a lower 
interest rate, investment may not pick up. The fall in IRR could be driven by 
adverse shocks to cash flows and deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.  
At the macroeconomic level supply bottlenecks and sluggish demand can 
depress MEC, which can more than offset the beneficial impact of a lower lending 
rate on investment and growth. The incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) has 
been rising in India in the last four years since 2008-09. The implicit marginal 
productivity of capital (MPC), which is the inverse of ICOR, accordingly has been 
declining (Chart 4).   
                                                            
7
 The IRR is that rate of discount which would equate discounted present value of expected return 
over the life time of a project to the cost of the project, thereby making the NPV (net present value) 
of the project equal to zero.

Conclusion 
 Let me conclude. The Reserve Bank has been traversing a growth-inflation 
knife edge in recent years. The sluggish growth conditions in the last two years and 
the dampened investment activities warranted a shift in the stance of monetary 
policy. The extent of monetary policy easing, however, has been circumscribed by 
the persisting risks to inflation and the external balance position.  Price stability and 
exchange rate stability are necessary preconditions to sustainable high growth. 
Furthermore, when non-monetary factors are impeding a robust revival in growth, 
lower real or nominal interest rates may not be just enough to stimulate growth.
