1Are Banks serving the Common Man ?Ladies and gentlemen of the Lions Club of Bombay,Thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to share my thoughtswith you all. Only Lions would be courageous enough to listen to a talk on thesubject of banking which is dry and devoid of any humour. But if you keep inmind that banks deal with your hard-earned savings, what I have to say may beof interest to you.2. The Reserve Bank has been trying to discipline banks with regard to thequality of customer service rendered by them since 1975. You may recall, thetimes when we had to wait for 20-30 minutes to withdraw cash; at least 2 days toget a cheque book; 4 hours to get a demand draft; at least 1 week to get a localcheque cleared and 4-6 weeks for an outstation cheque to get cleared; to facebank staff who were reluctant to update your passbook on the spot and offeredleast information on the bank’s products or their banking practices. Look attoday’s banking services: at the flick of the card you get cash from an ATM and ifthe ATM is in a shared network, it is even better because then you don’t need tohunt for your bank’s ATM; if your bank has a phone banking service, you can getcheque books delivered and cheques collected from your doorstep; a localcheque gets credited on the third day and an outstation cheque on the fifth day ifit is covered under intercity MICR processing, but let me add that for both localand outstation cheques, you can get immediate credit if the amount is Rs.15000/-. Banks evolve their own Board approved policy for immediate credit of local /outstation cheque, timeframe for collection of local / outstation cheques andinterest payment for delayed collection. There is no more fear of pilfered dividendand interest warrants as you can get these sums credited directly to your bankaccount; you can effect funds transfers almost instantly by EFT. Further, internetbanking and mobile banking have completely revolutionised the way bankingtransactions are committed; this is the epitome of embedding technology withbanking – though I am personally saddened by the lack of human interaction                                                1 Speech delivered by Smt. Kishori Udeshi, Deputy Governor, RBI at the Lions Club of Bombayon April 26, 2005.2between bank personnel and their customers – now their customers are facelesstelephones and mobile calls and clicks of the mouse!  Now it is not just borrowerswho choose the bank which offers a competitive price but even depositors whocall for tenders for placing Term Deposits!  We have indeed come a long way.3. In the area of foreign exchange, almost all needs of foreign exchange canbe met by banks, without requiring RBI’s approval. In fact now that we are soliberal we find very few takers. But we at RBI are constantly reviewing the qualityof service, rendered by banks in order to bring about more improvements.Therefore, to address the issue of banking services to the common man inparticular, RBI recently appointed a Committee, styled as Committee forProcedures and Performance Audit of Public Services (CPPAPS) under theChairmanship of Shri S.S. Tarapore, a former Deputy Governor of RBI – some ofyou might be well aware of his contribution in the field of banking and finance inIndia, especially his contribution as Chairman of the Committee on CapitalAccount Convertibility – which till date remains a bible for capital accountconvertibility. The Committee observed that there is a wide gap between theintent with which policies are formulated and the procedures followed by bankswhich totally derail the intent of the policy. This Committee was unique in manyways. First, it focussed solely on the services rendered by banks to the commonman. Secondly, in its evaluation of services it started from the customer-end. TheCommittee undertook incognito visits to bank branches including RBI’s offices fora first hand experience of difficulties faced by the public at large. Thirdly, itobserved that issuance of instructions by banks to its branches and theirimplementation at the grassroots level were two different things.4. The RBI has initiated action on the basis of the recommendations of theCommittee. To illustrate, let me mention a few of them :• Let me begin with the RBI itself. The Reserve Bank has introduced astandardised application form for Government of India Savings Bondspopularly known as RBI Bonds. The application form also includes rightsand responsibilities of applicants. It clearly indicates within how much time3customer should expect the bond to be delivered to him and also to whomone should approach if appropriate service is not provided.• The Reserve Bank has introduced OLTAS to render more efficient taxcollection.• Banks have been advised to review their existing policies and procedureswith regard to delivering of cheque book over the counters, introduction ofdrop box facility for cheques and acknowledgement of receipts/chequesthrough regular collection at branches, issue of statement of accounts atmonthly intervals with details of various transactions, to provide at leastone month’s advance information in case of any change in minimumbalance in Saving Accounts and charges of non-maintenance thereof; etc.• The Committee had commended the Clean Note Policy of the RBI andRBI is striving to vigorously pursue a largely successful Clean Note Policy;• The RBI Note Refund Rules are now in the public domain.• Banks are now required to have a Customer Service Committee of theBoard so that the subject gets special focussed attention. We in RBI arehopeful that such an institutional arrangement will go a long way inimproving services of banks.5. Any debate, any talk, any deliberations about the customer service inbanking would remain incomplete without reference to the late Shri M.R. Pai,who pioneered the consumer protection movement in the banking sector. Hiscontribution through the All India Bank Depositors Association in educating bankdepositors is path breaking. I quote Shri Pai’s words, “the biggest asset on thebalance sheet of banks today is the ignorance of customers of their rights andtheir reluctance to fight for them”.6. On conceptual ground quality of service is two dimensional. Firstdimension is the technical quality and the other is the functional quality.Technical quality depends on the contents of the service, i.e., authenticity of theservice, if the information given to the customer is technically correct or not andfrequency of information dissemination, while the functional quality deals withhow service is rendered. This in common parlance is “Service with a Smile”. Itwould appear that banking services in India need to improve on both counts.4Often customers do not get correct information in banks and more often acustomer gets service as if he was being obliged.7. Banking services are unique in the sense that diverse customers havemulti facet needs and, therefore, benchmarking of banking services becomes adifficult task. No doubt, a system of Citizens’ Charter has been introduced invarious banks but this only deals with the time limit within which a service wouldbe rendered to the customers. This does not assure quality of service.8. Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has also played a complementary role inefforts for improving customer service in banks. Last year, with RBI initiative IBAhas come out with a model Fair Practices Code. The Code is a public documentthat enlists what all a customer can expect from his bank. It also indicates theresponsibilities of banks while giving different kinds of banking services. IBA hasfurther come out with a Model Deposit Policy as each bank is adopting its ownpolicy. The purpose of the policy is that banks should deliver to depositors whatthey had promised at the time of taking deposit. It is after all depositors’ moneythat banks primarily use for lending and further their banking activity. Therefore,in the real sense it is the depositor who is the true and real owner of the bankrather than the shareholder.9. Any customer of a bank whose grievance with reference to deficiency inbanking service is not addressed to his/her satisfaction by the bank canapproach the Banking Ombudsman within a period of two months. Thedeficiencies that are covered include a variety of banking services, such as, non-payment/inordinate delay in the payment or collection of cheques, drafts, bills,non-issue of drafts to customers, non-adherence to prescribed working hours bybranches etc. Banking Ombudsman functions as an arbitrator in respect of anydispute with mutual consent of both the parties provided that the value of theclaim in such dispute does not exceed Rupees ten lakh. Banking Ombudsmenhave been appointed at 15 centres covering all States and Union Territories inIndia.10. There are equally important issues that most of us are concerned withwhich, while the regulator tries to address, we, as citizens, also should be awareof our own rights in the matters, such as:5(i) Intrusion of privacy.(ii) Anti-tying.(iii) Collection of unnecessary information for commercial reasons.(iv) Negligence with reference to customer data.(v) Credit card charges.(vi) Changes of interest rates and charges and fine print.(vii) Death of depositor.(viii) Appointment of recovery agents who are questionable practitioners.11. The Lions Club has been involved in many social projects and today inarranging this talk it has helped in spreading the awareness of rights andresponsibilities of a bank customer. Let me end by saying that the Reserve Bankwill continue to strive in its efforts to get banks to provide efficient and qualitycustomer services and would welcome any suggestions for improvement.
