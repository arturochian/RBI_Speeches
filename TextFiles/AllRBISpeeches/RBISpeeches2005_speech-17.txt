*Micro-Finance : Reserve Bank’s ApproachFriends,I am thankful to the organisers for giving me this opportunity to be amidst thisdistinguished gathering. Since Dr. Bimal Jalan, a Member of Parliament and mydistinguished predecessor, is chairing the session, let me start with his role in thesubject of my special address today.  The earliest reference to micro-credit in aformal statement of monetary and credit policy of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was inDr. Bimal Jalan’s Monetary and Credit Policy Statement of April 1999. The policyattached importance to the work of National Bank for Agriculture and RuralDevelopment (NABARD) and public sector banks in the area of micro-credit. Itannounced total deregulation of interest rates on loans by banks to micro-creditorganisations and by these organisations to their members and beneficiaries exceptin the case of government sponsored programmes.  Dr. Jalan, as Governor,continued to focus on this subject virtually in every one of his Annual and Mid-termReview of policy statements.  In all these statements, the basic objective has been ofmainstreaming micro-credit and accelerating the flow of bank credit to micro-financeinstitutions without jeopardising their decentralised, voluntary and non-bureaucraticcharacter.  Accordingly,  the banks were urged to make all out efforts for provision ofmicro-credit, especially forging linkages with Self-Help Groups (SHGs), either at theirown initiative or by enlisting support of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).The micro-credit extended by the banks is reckoned as part of their priority sectorlending, and they are free to devise appropriate loan and savings products in thisregard.2. I am delighted to continue the excellent tradition set by my predecessor inregard to micro-credit. Accordingly, RBI announced a policy framework in the Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy of November 2003 based on interactivesessions with various stakeholders in the sector and reports of four Informal Groups.The framework urged the banks to provide adequate incentives to their branches forfinancing the SHGs, establish linkages with them, simplify the procedures whileproviding for total flexibility in such procedures to suit the local conditions.  It was alsomade clear that the group dynamics of working of the SHGs may be left tothemselves and need neither be regulated nor formal structures be imposed orinsisted upon. NABARD was advised to reinforce its commitment to enhancing theflow of micro-credit while simplifying the process and to devise mechanisms to ensuresharing of experiences amongst the bank branches that were closely involved inextending micro-finance. In view of the interim report of the Task Force on Revival ofCooperative Credit Institutions (Vyas Committee), RBI clarified that micro financeinstitutions (MFIs) would not be permitted to accept public deposits unless theycomply with the extant regulatory framework of the Reserve Bank.3. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2005 noted the progress and targets ofSHGs programme and indicated two measures to give further fillip to microfinancemovement. First, access to External Commercial Borrowings was indicated for nongovernmental organisations engaged in micro finance activities. Second, the policyalso announced that the modalities were being worked out for allowing banks toadopt the agency model by using the infrastructure of civil society organisations, rural                                           * Address by Dr. Y.V.

It must be recognised that considerable work had been done by the RBI in thissector since 1991 before making the formal policy announcements in 1999. In 1991-92, a pilot project for linking about 500 SHGs with banks was launched by NABARDin consultation with the RBI which advised the banks to actively participate in it. In1994, the RBI constituted a Working Group on NGOs and SHGs. On therecommendations of the Group, the Reserve Bank advised that the banks’ financingof SHGs would be reckoned as part of their lending to weaker sections and suchlending should be reviewed by banks and also at the State Level Bankers’ Committee(SLBC) level, at regular intervals. As a follow up of the recommendations of theNABARD Working Group, the RBI took a series of measures in April 1996 to give athrust to micro-finance based lending, and these are worth recalling.5. Banks were advised to consider lending to the SHGs as part of theirmainstream credit operations, to identify branches having potential for linkage withSHGs and provide necessary support services to such branches while including theSHG-lending within their Service Area Plan.  The Service Area branches, in turn,were to fix their own programme for lending to the SHGs with a view to enabling themto get the benefit of catalytic services of NGOs. The Service Area branch managerswere asked to have an ongoing dialogue and rapport with the NGOs and the SHGs ofthe area for effecting linkage. Banks were also advised that SHGs, registered orunregistered, which engaged in promoting the saving habits among their members,would be eligible to open savings bank accounts with banks irrespective of theiravailment of credit facilities from banks. It was also decided that flexibility allowed tobanks in respect of margins, security norms, etc., as part of the pilot project forsavings-linked loans to SHGs would continue. Further it was decided that NABARDwould continue to provide refinance to banks under the linkage project at the ratesstipulated by NABARD. It was also decided that banks may charge interest on thefinance provided to the Groups / NGOs for on-lending to SHGs at the rates indicatedby the NABARD from time to time. Further, the SHGs were to be free to decide on theinterest rate to be charged to their members, provided the rate of interest was notexcessive.6. While close coordination between the NABARD and the RBI characterised thegrowth of the micro-credit movement till 1999, the Government of India took an activeinterest in the subject as evidenced by the successive announcements in the BudgetSpeeches of Finance Ministers since 1999. However, the announcements relatedessentially to SHG programme, except in the budget speech of 2005 where there wasa separate and distinct reference to MFIs, with a mention of a suitable legislation,though the thrust remains to be the linkage with the banks for providing financialintermediation. The budget speech states:“At present, micro finance institutions (MFIs) obtain finance from banksaccording to guidelines issued by the RBI. MFIs seek to provide small scalecredit and other financial services to low income households and smallinformal businesses. Government intends to promote MFIs in a big way. Theway forward, I believe, is to identify MFIs, classify and rate such institutionsand empower them to intermediate between the lending banks and the3beneficiaries. Commercial banks may appoint MFIs as “bankingcorrespondents” to provide transaction services on their behalf. Since MFIsrequire infusion of new capital, I propose to re-designate the existing Rs.100crore Micro Finance Development Fund as the “Micro Finance Developmentand Equity Fund”, and increase the corpus to Rs.200 crore. The fund will bemanaged by a Board consisting of representatives of NABARD, commercialbanks and professionals with domain knowledge. The Board will be asked tosuggest suitable legislation, and I expect to introduce a draft Bill in the nextfiscal year”.7. It must be recognised that the policy of expanding the thrust beyond micro-credit to the MFIs is not a reflection on the lack of progress in provision of micro-creditbut a reiteration of its success and a possible approach to widening, deepening andstrengthening micro-finance movement as a whole. The evolution of SHG Bank-Linkage Programme could be viewed in terms of three distinct phases, viz., (i) pilottesting during 1992 to 1995, (ii) mainstreaming during 1996 to 1998 and (iii)expansion from 1998 onwards. The cumulative number of SHGs ‘credit-linked’ to thebanks showed a significant expansion from 255 as at end-March 1993 to 16.18 lakhas at end-March 2005. Commensurate with an increase in the cumulative refinancesupport from NABARD from about Rs.0.3 crore as at end-March 1993 to overRs.3,092 crore as at end-March 2005, the cumulative bank loans disbursedwitnessed a sharp increase from about Rs.0.3 crore to around Rs.6,898 core duringthe period. This translates to an estimated 2.42 core poor families being broughtwithin the fold of banking services. The loans per SHG increased to Rs.42,620 during2004-05 from an average of Rs. 36,179 in the previous year, reflecting the process ofdeepening of the credit access amongst the SHGs.New Paradigm8. It is clear that the dominant theme so far has been of extending micro-creditthrough Bank-SHG linkages, with NABARD playing a leadership role and micro-finance institutions, mainly NGOs, playing a catalytic as well as enabling role at thegross root level.  However, there is clearly an emerging new paradigm in theapproach to micro-finance.  It would be appropriate to recall that while the term micro-credit has not been strictly defined at present, it usually refers to the credits of “verysmall amounts”. However, for the purpose of exempting the micro-finance companiesregistered under Section 25 of the Companies Act from the core regulatory provisionsattracted by NBFCs, such companies are required by RBI to be engaged solely inextending micro-finance upto Rs.50,000 for small businesses and upto Rs.1.25 lakhfor housing in rural areas. The term “micro-finance” has been given a workingdefinition by the Task Force on Supportive Policy and Regulatory Framework forMicro-Finance set up by NABARD in November 1998 as: “provision of thrift, creditand other financial services and products of very small amounts to the poor in rural,semi-urban and urban areas for enabling them to raise their income levels andimprove living standards”. It is, however, understood that the MFIs provide other non-credit services as well such as capacity building, training, marketing of the products ofthe SHGs, micro-insurance, etc. In this background, the following considerations arerelevant :First, micro-finance would be seen to be a broader concept than micro-creditand the focus of discussion has now expanded beyond micro-credit to cover micro-finance.4Second, there is a recognition in the Annual Policy Statement of the RBI for2005-06 of the need for enhancing financial inclusion and the banks were urged toreview their existing practices to align them with the objective of financial inclusion inregard to banking services. This underlines the importance of the micro-financemovement in addressing the issue of financial exclusion.Third, the increasing size and growth of MFIs seem to warrant a clearer policyframework to cover operations in financial services in addition to credit,  in respect ofboth bank- and  NABARD-led micro-finance through SHGs and micro-financeinstitutions.Fourth, the delivery of non-credit financial services, such as insurance andmutual funds by micro finance institutions seems to be possible but as a pre-condition, there is a need for a clear framework for the approach of differentregulators to these non-bank financial services by MFIs.Fifth, the organisational forms of micro-finance institutions appear varied,though the activities may in some cases include non-financial services.  This makesthem subject to differing legal frameworks as per the organisational form.Sixth, different State Governments take varying approaches to themicrofinance institutions – including subsidising interest rates. The nature and spreadof micro-finance movement also differ significantly across States.Seventh, as per information available, a significant part of the currentmicrofinance activity is related to credit, which is perhaps attributable to both the feltcredit needs and the absence of a conscious policy thrust in regard to non-creditrelated financial services.Eighth, developments in technology seem to provide a window of opportunityto reduce the transaction costs and thus enable microfinance to be commerciallyviable and profitable activity.Finally, the Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for 2005-06 made areference to the possibility of a suitable legislation in this regard.9. Let me outline a preliminary response to these developments which, as will bedescribed later, is being revisited by us. Broadly, the approach of RBI has been toemphasise the informality of micro-finance and focus on the developmental aspects.The regulatory dispensation put in place by the RBI seeks to enable enhanced creditflow from banks through MFIs and could be further refined by RBI, as necessary. Onthe suggestion for bringing the micro-finance entities under a system of regulationthrough a separate legislation, the RBI felt that microfinance movement across thecountry involving common people has benefited immensely by its informality andflexibility. Hence, their organisation, structure and methods of working should besimple and any regulation will be inconsistent with the core-spirit of the movement. Itwas also felt that ideally, the NABARD or the banks should devise appropriatesafeguards locally in their relationship with the MFIs, taking into account differentorganisational forms of such entities. In any case, if any statute for regulation of MFIsis contemplated, it may be at the State-level with no involvement of the RBI as abanking regulator or for extending deposit-insurance.Issues and next steps510. In view of the new paradigm that was noticed in regard to microfinance, theRBI decided to revisit the issue in a comprehensive manner. Accordingly, severalinitiatives were taken in the recent months. First, consultations were arranged withseveral representatives of microfinance institutions in select centres to obtain theirviews. Second, based on such consultations, a Technical Paper on Policy relating toDevelopment, Regulation and Supervision of Microfinance Services was preparedand was discussed with the representatives of this sector on July 18, 2005. Therecommendations of the Paper are being considered in consultation with theGovernment. Third, and in parallel, an internal group of RBI on Rural Credit andMicro-Finance (Khan Committee) had been set up to examine the issues relating tothis sector and the draft report of the Group was placed in the public domain on June1, 2005 for comments. The report captures experience of other countries and ourrequirements both in terms of development of micro-finance and of financial inclusion.The final version of the Khan Committee report dated July 19, 2005 has since beenplaced on the website of the RBI. The report considers (a) policy options andstrategies for deepening and widening of financial services; (b) promotion,development and rating of microfinance institutions and other outreach entities; and(c) regulatory issues and concerns.  The Report will form a basis for evolving a policyframework in consultation with the Government, NABARD and other stake-holders.11. It is, however, necessary to recognise that there are several issues which haveto be clarified as one proceeds with a response, to what may be termed as, the newparadigm in micro-finance, described above.  Importantly, the new paradigm seemsto imply a process of formalising what has essentially been an informal mechanism ofcredit-disbursal, occasionally coupled with other activities, and expanding its scope. Itis worth recounting some of the major issues in this regard.First, how do we distinguish micro-finance institution from micro-creditinstitution and both these from other financial institutions? Is it by the ceilingsimposed on the size of deposits, lendings and / or by defining activities? What part orpercentage of the activity could be non-financial while the institution continues to bean MFI? Is there merit in differentiating between not-for-profit MFIs and the profit-seeking ones ?Second, how do we identify, for regulatory purposes micro-credit institutions asdistinct from micro-finance institutions since the latter may need more varied skillsand in any case, warrant a policy view by more than one financial sector regulator?Third, should the SHGs, which have no formal organisational structure, bebrought within the ambit of the proposed formal framework for the MFIs?Fourth, currently there are five organisational forms of the MFIs, viz., Trusts;Societies; Cooperative Societies; Not-for-Profit Companies and Non-Banking FinanceCompanies. There are also instances of large corporates undertaking micro-creditactivity as a part of their operations. What are the merits and demerits of recognisingone or more or all the organisational forms under a formalised regulatory frameworkfor the MFIs?Fifth, there is also a need to recognise the large regional differences in thespread of SHGs and the MFIs across the country. While the issue needs deeperanalysis to identify the reasons for such variation and to promote balanced growth ofthe MFIs, it, prima facie, appears that the MFIs have flourished more in the States6with well developed banking infrastructure and outreach. Thus, the MFIs in ourcountry would seem to be a supplement rather than a substitute for a developedbanking infrastructure.Sixth, what should be the role of the foreign capital and venture capital inregard to the MFIs ? It may be necessary to recognise here the orientation of themicro-finance activity given the limitation of size and skills in the MFIs and thenconsistency with the risk-reward bias of such sources of commercial capital. Asregards the external commercial borrowings, the imperatives of exchange rate riskand the capacity of the MFIs to effectively assess and manage this risk would alsoneed to be duly reckoned.Seventh, what could be the scope and effectiveness of a self regulatoryorganisation for the MFIs and how it dove-tails with the possible formalised regulatoryframework under contemplation?Eighth, the credit rating is usually assigned for specific instruments issued orfor a defined purpose and often, on a continuing basis.  There is merit in devisingrating system for the MFIs, recognising that such exercises are seldom for localisedviews amongst decentralised entities. It will be instructive to review our experience sofar in regard to utility and quality of rating exercises of MFIs.  How to ensure that therating exercise adds value to the localised operations of the MFIs ?Ninth, what are the prospects for expanding the permission accorded by theRBI to the non-banking financial companies for offering credit and other financialservices to not-for-profit companies ? What are the prospects for creating a separatecategory of NBFC-MFIs to be regulated by RBI ?Finally, should all the MFIs or only a select category out of them be permittedto accept public deposits? While there is a view that only banks should be permittedto accept public deposits, currently non-banking financial companies are alsopermitted to accept public deposits but subject to the regulatory prescriptions of theRBI. Needless to say, it is the issue of accepting public deposits that poses majorchallenges, both legislative and more importantly, of moral hazard.12. As the experience with cooperative banking shows, a soft regulatory regimerelative to scheduled commercial banks, be it in terms of governance or prudentialaspects, trends to attract less than truly ‘fit and proper’ persons to capture suchinstitutions. Indeed it is possible to argue that our experience with bringingcooperative banks under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 in 1966 coupled with theircoverage under Deposit Insurance, compared with the health and reach of thecooperative sector before such regulation came into effect, would provide somelessons in this regard. In fact, RBI in its comments on the draft report of the TaskForce on Revival of Cooperative Credit Institutions (Vaidyanathan Committee,February 2005) argued in favour of substituting RBI’s regulatory jurisdiction with aseparate independent national or State level regulatory, body broadly in line with whatwas advocated by Dr. Bimal Jalan in his policy statement in 2001 in regard to UrbanCooperative Banks. Currently, it is proposed to examine the issue in detail in the lightof recommendations of the Khan Committee and keeping in view the MicrofinanceConsensus Guidelines issued in July 2003 by the Consultative Group to Assist thePoor (CGAP) incorporating the Guiding Principles on Regulation and Supervision ofthe MFIs. These Guiding Principles bring out globally recommended principles on7regulation and supervision of micro-finance and they need to be considered in thecontext of conditions in our country.13. There are several operational issues which could be addressed throughcoordinated efforts of the central government, State governments, regulators, banksand the NABARD. RBI has an interest in pursuing the subject as part of its thrusttowards financial inclusion. As the micro-credit approach yields place to a moreencompassing micro-finance approach, coordinating mechanisms amongst financialsector regulators and institutional regulators have to be considered. A view needs tobe taken on permitting scheduled commercial banks to participate in the equity of theMFIs. There may also be a need for establishing processes for transition from oneform of organisation to another, while remaining engaged in the micro finance activity.There are several tax measures, both at Central and State levels, from which MFIshave been seeking special dispensation but a view is yet to be taken on many ofthem. Training and capacity building is an area of high priority which, coupled withwidespread use of technology, could reduce transaction costs and improve overalleffectiveness while imparting robustness to the movement. Some States like AndhraPradesh intend providing financial support for these purposes. There is considerablescope for increasing the tried and successful model of Bank-SHG linkages, especiallyto large tracts in the country which have not been adequately covered.  RBI iscurrently engaged in exploring a forum where these issues could be addressed on acontinuing basis, through a participative and consultative process amongst all thestakeholders.14. In conclusion, it is necessary to recognise that we, in India, have to focus onextending financial services in both rural and urban areas for ensuring financialinclusion of all segments of the population. At the same time, one should avoid thetemptation of creating one set of banking and financial institutions to cater to the pooror the unorganised, and another for the rest. The medium to long-term objectiveshould be to ensure inclusion of all segments in the main-stream institutions whiletaking advantage of the flexibility of multiplicity of models of delivering a wide range offinancial services. In this light, a comprehensive framework to revive the cooperativecredit system, revitalise the Regional Rural Banks and reorient commercial bankingsystem needs to get a high priority while simultaneously encouraging and enablingthe growth of micro-finance movement in India, which has been very successful. Weneed to build on its strengths and extend it to vast areas which are inadequatelycovered by both banking and micro-credit entities. Micro-finance, broadly defined,needs to be explored in the light of the new paradigm described. RBI and NABARDrecognise the growing importance of micro-finance and are committed to enable itshealthy growth. However, several issues, both in regard to regulation as well asdevelopment of the MFIs need to be considered and must be comprehensivelyaddressed. While the report of the Khan Committee would provide a good startingpoint for taking a view on developmental aspects, in particular, the CGAP’s GuidingPrinciples on Regulation and Supervision on Micro-finance provide a valuable andglobally relevant framework in regard to the regulatory issues. The proposed forumfor a consultative process on the MFIs would also be useful in evolving anappropriate framework for development of the MFI sector. No doubt, a very well-crafted balance between the regulation and growth objectives would be warranted informulating our approach to a regulatory regime, keeping in view the big challenge offinancial inclusion of a large segment of the Indian population.Thank you.
