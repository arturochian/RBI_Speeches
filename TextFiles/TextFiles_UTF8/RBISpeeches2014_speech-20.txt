New-Gen Urban Cooperative Banks - Some Musings    Dear Shri Jyotindra Mehta, Chairman, Gujarat Urban Cooperative Banks Federation,  Shri V S Das, Director, Centre for Banking Research, Development & Excellence, other  dignitaries and delegates. I feel specially privileged to address this Conference of urban  co-operative banks, which is very aptly titled   Sahakar Setu-2014 focusing on  the theme of Next-Gen Co-operative Banks. I am also happy to note that a Centre for  Banking Research, Development & Excellence is being set up here as a hub for training  and capacity building in the urban banking sector and also to promote research relevant  to the functioning of co-operative banks.    2. Talking to all of you in Gujarat is also of very special significance, not only  because of the origin and proliferation of cooperative banks here but also it is the birth  place of M.K. Gandhi, father of the nation, who propounded the Theory of Trusteeship.  Putting it in Gandhiji's words "Supposing I have come by a fair amount of wealth  either  by way of legacy, or by means of trade and industry  I must know that all that wealth  does not belong to me; what belongs to me is the right to an honourable livelihood, no  better than that enjoyed by millions of others. The rest of my wealth belongs to the  community and must be used for the welfare of the community."    3. If you notice, cooperatives are also based on the same principles of community  camaraderie, - mutual help, democratic decision making and open membership.  Cooperatives represent a new and alternative approach to organisation as against  proprietary firms, partnership firms and joint stock companies, which represent the  dominant form of commercial organisation. As you may be aware, cooperatives around  the world generally operate according to the seven core principles and values, adopted  by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) in 1995. Cooperatives trace the roots of  these principles to the first modern cooperative founded in Rochdale, England in 1844.  The principles cover various aspects of cooperatives beginning from its membership to  concern on community.  Address by Shri R. Gandhi, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Conference of Urban Co-operative Banks  in Gujarat, Ahmedabad on June 8, 2014. Assistance by Shri Sushanta Kumar Kar, General Manager is gratefully  acknowledged.   Evolution of the Urban Bank Sector  1 4. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) started in India back in 1889 exactly a  century and quarter ago here in Gujarat and India has one of the oldest community- banking movement in the world. However, the real growth and proliferation began after  this sector was brought under the purview of Banking Regulation Act in 1966. The  evolution thereafter may be broadly divided into three phases, Growth phase, crisis  phase and Consolidation phase.    Growth Phase (1966-2003)  5. In 1966, there were about 1100 UCBs with deposits and advances of `1.67  billion and `1.53 billion respectively. Since then there has been phenomenal growth in  terms of their numbers, size and scale of operations. The Reserve Bank pursued a  liberal licensing policy especially pursuant to the recommendations of the Marathe  Committee, which had suggested dispensing the one-district, one-bank approach and  to shift the stance of the policy to assess the need and potential in an area for  mobilizing deposits and purveying of credit for a new UCB. In the year 1993, before the  liberalisation of bank licensing policy, there were 1311 UCBs having deposits and  advances amounting to `111.08 billion and `87.13 billion, respectively, which increased  to 1926 UCBs with deposits and advances of `1020.74 billion and `649.74 billion,  2 respectively by end-March, 2004. This is because after the liberalisation of licensing  norms in May 1993, up to June 2001, 823 bank licences were issued.     Crisis Phase (2003-2008)  6. However, it was observed that nearly one-third of these newly licensed UCBs  became financially unsound within a short period. RBI, therefore, constituted a  screening committee consisting of outside experts in June 2001 to examine the  applications for licences. The Committee recommended that it should be made                                                    1  Anyonya Sahkari Mandali in Gujarat 1889      2  `15785 billion and `8643 billion ,respectively, for scheduled commercial banks  2   mandatory for all newly proposed UCBs to come through a process of graduation from a  co-operative credit society on the strength of demonstrated and verifiable track record.    7. However, in the light of the experience and the prevailing financial health of the  UCB sector after the Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank episode, it was  announced in the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2004-05 that the Reserve Bank  would consider issuance of fresh licences only after a comprehensive policy on UCBs,  including an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the sector, is put in place  and no fresh licences have been issued thereafter for organizing new UCBs.    8. The number of UCBs declined from 1926 as at end- March 2004 to 1770 by end-  March 2008. The deposits and advances of urban banks increased only marginally  during the same period from `1020.74 billion and `649.74 billion to `1398.71 billion and  3 `904.44 billion , respectively, posting an average annual growth of 9% in deposits and  4 10% in advances .     9. Reserve Bank took several steps to strengthen the sector during this period.  Most important among them is the Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with all State  Governments and the Central Government. In order to improve the financial soundness  of the UCB sector, Reserve Bank of India entered into Memoranda of Understanding  (MoU) with all State Governments and the Central Government since 2005. The MOUs  facilitated coordination of regulatory policies and actions through the mechanism of  TAFCUBs, a comprehensive set of capacity building initiatives and measures to bring in  efficiency through adoption of technology. This phase also ushered in voluntary  consolidation in the sector by merger of non-viable UCBs with financially sound and  well-managed UCBs.     Consolidation Phase (2008 onwards)                                                    3  In 2008 deposits and advances were `33201 billion and `24770 billion, respectively, for scheduled  commercial banks  4  The average annual growth growth in deposits and advances of scheduled commercial banks during the  period was 28% and 47% respectively.  3   10. As a result of the new initiatives and sustained efforts by RBI, the number of  financially weak banks in the UCB sector declined and consequently the total number of  UCBs declined from 1770 as end-March 2008 to 1606 by end-March 2013. However,  the deposits and advances of urban banks increased from `1398.71 billion and `904.44  5 billion to `2769.41 billion and `1809.60 billion, respectively, during the same period .  6 Thus, there was an average annual growth of 20 percent in deposits and in advances,  which is more than double of the previous phase growth. Further, the number of  7 financially sound banks also increased from 248 as on March 31, 2010 to 684 as on  March 31, 2013. Incidentally, mergers of as many as 116 UCBs have been effected till  date after 2005.     11. Against this backdrop, with a view to increasing the coverage of banking services  amongst local communities, the Malegam Committee was set up in 2010 for studying  the advisability of granting new urban co-operative banking licences. After elaborate  deliberations, the Committee recommended that UCBs play a useful role and there is  need for a greater presence of UCBs in unbanked districts and in centers having  population of less than 5 lakh. It is necessary to encourage new entrants to open banks  and branches in States and Districts which are unbanked or inadequately banked. It is  equally necessary to discourage new entrants from opening branches in Districts and  population centers which are already adequately banked. Further, the Committee  suggested that the existing well-managed co-operative credit societies meeting certain  financial criteria should be given priority for granting licenses. The Committees  recommendations are under examination by RBI.    Issues for discussion  12. As we have observed from the trend and pattern of growth in this sector so far,  we have left Madhavpura long behind and moved ahead by fostering organic and                                                    5  In 2013 deposits and advances were `74295 billion and `58797 billion, respectively, for scheduled  commercial banks  6  Around 25% average annual growth in deposits and advances for the scheduled commercial banks  7  Broadly defined  at CRAR of 10%, net profit for last three years, Gross NPA<7% and  Net NPA ?3%  4   8 9 inorganic growth. With higher degree of CRAR and less NPAs , the system has more  or less stabilized, while the process of consolidation is still on. The first question that  rises now is what next. Where do we go from here? Have we reached a plateau where  we need to maintain and strengthen the healthy consolidation achieved or should we  allow further growth? Given the fact that UCBs are an important segment of the banking  system, play a vital role in mobilizing deposits and purveying credit to the people of  small means thereby enhancing financial inclusion and facilitate payment and  settlement, it will only be appropriate to support their growth and proliferation further.    13. That brings us to the second question. If we allow further growth, in what form  should that be? It again can be addressed in two ways. We either allow them to grow in  the existing set up or UCBs above a certain threshold may assume a new corporate  identity.    14. As an implication of this, for large UCBs who have reached certain threshold in  the size and complexity of business, enabling their graduation into commercial banks  can be thought of, so that their further growth is facilitated. It is important to mention  here that once cooperative banks reach a certain threshold level, they are also  expected to follow a regimen like large banks and standardized global practices, which  may not be possible within the existing legal structure of cooperative banks. Thus,  before we move forward, the existing legal and regulatory framework need to be  revisited to enable smooth transition. Specifically, we need to debate the needed legal  framework that will facilitate conversion of cooperatives into joint stock companies,  conversion of deposit holders into share holders etc.    15. The other alternative could be to allow the UCBs to grow and sustain themselves  in the existing set-up. In that event, the obvious question that comes to mind is what are  the existing restrictions that can be liberalised and what further measures can be                                                    8  88.2 per cent of the total UCBs have reported a CRAR of 9 per cent or more as on March 31, 2013  9  The gross and net NPA ratios as on March 31, 2013 stood at 6.0 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively  5   envisaged for the smooth non - disruptive growth of the sector? I hope the delegates will  deliberate on these issues and suggest possible measures.    The Next Phase- Next Generation cooperative banks  16. Since the theme of the Seminar is Next-Gen Co-operative Banks let me now  briefly dwell on the subject. To begin with let us analyse some of the best global  practices in cooperative banking and their implications for next- gen cooperative banks  in India, before moving forward to what is our expectation from these banks.    European Co-operative Business Model  17. As you may be aware, the co-operative banking sector contributes significantly to  the growth, stability and competitiveness of the European banking industry at a local  and regional level. Ordinary citizens can become members / owners of co-operative  banks with relatively small investments. As a result, they have a direct say in the  business and are involved in the governance, strategy and risk management processes.  The core business of co-operative banks is value creation for their members and a long  term relationship of trust, opposed to the profit maximization approach of mainstream  banks.    18. It is worth mentioning that their performance is a result of their central focus on  retail banking, solid capitalisation and their high-quality credit portfolios. In fact, in Italy,  France, Germany and Netherlands where co-operative banks market share in loans  range between 25% and 45%, SMEs represent between 20% and 50% of the total client  portfolio of co-operative banks. They are able to face the challenges of the new post  crisis environment because their business model responds to the present needs and  expectations.     19. Further, across Europe, Cooperative banks exceed the minimum legal capital  ratio requirement of 8%, with an average ratio of about 9%. Credit ratings reflect this  very well, ranging between AA and AAA for the largest co-operative banking groups in  Western Europe.  6   20. With their roots in the Europe, the Rabobank Group, DZ Bank Group, Credit  Agricole Group, etc have grown in recent decades into an international financial  services provider that has activities in the field of banking, asset management, leasing,  insurance and real estate. The strong points of the cooperative structure became  evident during the financial crises of recent years. They did not have to ask for state aid  and were able to keep financial results well up to standard. Measured according to Tier  1 capital, these Groups are the worlds largest financial institutions. All rating agencies  continue to give them high ratings.    21. Their cooperative identity stems back to the early twentieth century. The local  member cooperatives continue to be the collective owner of these groups to this day.  The groups support the member cooperatives and oversee the subsidiaries and  affiliated companies. The members not only benefit from banking and non-banking  advantages, they also have the opportunity to join in the discussion and co-decide on  the banks course. Local member banks serve millions of retail and wholesale  customers with a comprehensive range of financial services. The groups are leaders in  nearly all customer and product segments, from youth to start-ups and from mortgages  to corporate enterprises.    22. I feel Indian cooperative banks can gain from the business matrix of their  European counterparts to cope up with the competition and pressure from bigger  commercial banks and maximize value creation while not undermining the importance  of solid capitalization and high-quality credit portfolio.    Asian Cooperative Business Models  23. If we look eastward, we observe a considerably large presence of co-operatives  in Asia Pacific also. In Asia-Pacific alone there were 22,212 credit unions in 2012 which  were more than double of the 10,051 figure of North America and Europe put together.  In terms of the underlining focus also, it is observed that the co-operatives in Asia were  basically formed to bring about socio-economic development, particularly with respect to  agriculture and rural development.  7   24. In Asia itself, there have been many success stories to emulate. An exemplary  initiative which the Co-operative Development Authority (CDA) of the Philippines has  taken is the launch of the Co-operative Information System. The CDA in association  with the US Agency for International Development and another technology partner  developed this web-based database of co-operatives, to be accessed in real-time at any  of the CDAs extension counters. The information on each cooperatives annual  organizational and financial status through the Co-operative Annual Performance  Report is also integrated with this database, thereby providing a platform for the co- operatives to exchange information readily. Further and more importantly, the main aim  of the system is to help the Government in creating performance standards, policies,  regulations and development programmes for the overall benefit of the sector. Perhaps,  the creation of such technology information system will also help our cooperative sector  by providing a platform to them to exchange information readily for performance  oriented and integrated development.    Cooperativeness among cooperative banks  25. Cooperatives also need  cooperation among themselves to support and promote  their growth and expansion. As you might be aware, the V.S. Das Working Group  constituted by RBI to study these umbrella organization of cooperative banks  internationally found that there are two broad approaches in this regard.    26. In European countries, the Umbrella Organization is generally in the form of a  strong apex level entity. All the local cooperative banks are generally members of the  apex entity.  Each member exercises its voting rights under the one member one vote  principle. The apex entity supports and advises the individual member banks in areas  such as customer services, ALM, IT, Mutual Funds, product development, etc.      27. In the case of Australia, USA and, Canada, the Umbrella Organization is not part  of any group, but is a distinct entity where the credit unions are its members. In US  there is an Umbrella of Umbrella Organizations.   The Umbrella Organization in US  provides extensive investment, liquidity, and cash-management products and services;  8   risk-management and analytic capabilities; settlement, funds transfer and payment  services; and safekeeping and custody services. However, in Australia the emphasis  has been on payment clearing services and emergency liquidity support.     28. These organizations are serving the sector well and have not only resulted in  greater efficiency of operations of their members at the grassroots, but have also  contributed significantly in augmenting financial stability and safeguarding depositors  interests. This has given comfort to the regulators. Notably, in Australia all credit unions  adhere to the Basle II norms and their average CRAR is 16 percent.      29. It is in this context I will like to touch upon the need for an umbrella organization  for the UCB sector in India that will be the beginning of the next part of my address, viz.,  our expectation from the next-gen UCB sector in India.    Expectation from next-gen UCBs    Umbrella Organisation for UCBs in India  30. UCB sector in India needs to have the benefit of an Umbrella Organization of its  own customized to the legal framework in India and the challenges of the sector. In  India only scheduled UCBs have direct access to liquidity support from RBI in the form  of refinance. Other UCBs are dependent on District Cooperative Banks / State  Cooperative Banks for their liquidity needs.  Some District Cooperative Banks / State  Cooperative Banks are themselves financially not well.   There is also a need to provide  the management, IT and training and other services which the UCB sector needs.    31. For our UCB sector, the V S Das Group had recommended the requirements of  the provision of payment and settlement services; the provision of other services, which  are mainly in the region of management or outsourced services; the provision of liquidity  support through state level schemes; and the provision of solvency support through  state level schemes. The Group further recommended that there should be two  separate Umbrella Organizations. First one is a national level organization which  provides payment and settlement services and other services as also liquidity support to  9   its members. The second could be state level organizations or outside agencies, which  provide the management, IT and training and other services.     32. The proposals are being examined by RBI in consultation with urban bank  federations and other stake holders. In this context, I feel that the Centre for Banking  Research, Development & Excellence that is being set up here as a hub for training and  capacity building in the UCB sector is a good initiative in that direction.        Technology-Savvy UCBs  33. It is heartening to note that leveraging on technology is being taken up for  discussion in this Conference. In todays technology driven world, one cannot ignore the  role of technology in providing competitive banking services and all UCBs must exhibit  the keenness to adopt technology in a time-bound framework. Presently, only 32% (510  out of 1589 as on March, 2014) of UCBs have adopted Core Banking Solution (CBS).  Delay in adopting technology has resulted in UCBs losing their customers to  commercial banks. They also become vulnerable to frauds due to use of applications  that are outdated or lacking security features, etc. Also manual book-keeping system  has led to arrears in reconciliation of accounts and made them vulnerable to frauds.     34. RBI has advised UCBs to adopt CBS in a graduated framework: large UCBs by  Dec 31, 2013, tier I banks by June 30, 2014 and unit banks by Dec 31, 2014. In future,  Reserve Bank will definitely look forward to more technology-savvy UCBs competing  with commercial banks for customer spaces.    Cooperative character of UCBs  35. Apart from the cooperativeness among cooperative banks, the next issue to  ponder over is the cooperativeness inside a cooperative bank. We observe that over the  years, many UCBs have lost their cooperative character and have been reduced to  almost family run institutions. To ensure cooperative membership, RBI has prescribed  that the proportion of borrowing nominal members should be limited to 20% of regular  10   members. Some large multi-state UCBs have aligned their business models and goals  with those of commercial banks while availing the concessions to the sector.     36. In this context, a study was undertaken by the RBI on cooperativeness of  cooperative banks. The study found that the cooperative business model has withstood  the test of times in several countries in the world and also weathered the recent  financial crisis in the most non-disruptive manner while commercial entities have  struggled to stay afloat. What has seen them through is the cooperativeness in their  character, which is somehow getting diluted in the Indian UCBs. The assessment of the  study establishes that Cooperativeness of Cooperative banks in India is on the  decline.     37. RBI, therefore, conducted a Seminar on this subject in September last year to  sensitize the cooperative banks on this crucial issue. Some of the steps to enhance the  cooperativeness in UCBs in India could be increasing member awareness to strengthen  the democratic character, focus on member education and rekindle members interest in  the principles of cooperation. Steps can be also taken to increase in the quorum  requirement for Annual General Body meetings, make provision of electronic and  secure remote voting facility and cap the tenure/term of the Directors of UCBs in the  Board.    Strengthening Capital standards   38. In todays globalised world it is difficult to insulate our institutions from the best  global regulatory practices.     39. In India UCBs can raise capital only from their members. Recognising this  limitation, RBI has prescribed share-linking to borrowing. The matter was further  examined by a Working Group appointed by RBI and based on their recommendations.  UCBs were permitted in 2008 to raise capital through innovative instruments like  Perpetual Non-Cumulative/Cumulative and Redeemable Preference Shares as also  Long Term (Subordinated) Deposits. RBI has issued several guidelines for financial  11   restructuring of less capitalised UCBs such as conversion of deposits into equity,  guidelines for merger including that with DICGC support, guidelines for transfer of asset  & liabilities of weak UCBs to commercial Banks with DICGC support, etc.    40. Reserve Bank of India has adopted a calibrated and gradual approach towards  application of Basel standards for various regulated entities keeping in view their  systemic importance and availability of skill sets. As of now, UCBs have been subjected  to Basel I requirements for computation of capital. Certain elements of market risk  management have been made applicable for bigger UCBs conducting forex  transactions.    41. However, it may be worth mentioning in this context that keeping in view the risk  management structure of cooperative banks, internationally Basel II norms are  applicable for Co-operative banks in many of the advanced countries. Although in view  of the heterogeneity in size and sophistication of Indian UCBs RBI has taken a  considered view, the next-gen banks must gear up for adopting global best practices in  prudential regulations.    Role of Financial Inclusion by UCBs  42. Our next issue for deliberation could be the important expectation from  Government, RBI and people in general from the banks, i.e. promoting financial  inclusion. I am happy to note that this issue is also included for discussion in this  Conference. The organizational structure, local clientele and easy access are UCBs  strengths in this regard. RBI has taken a  number of measures in this direction for UCBs  by prescribing introduction of No-frills account with nil or low minimum balance,   relaxation of Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for small accounts, liberalising  norms for opening of new branches and off-site ATMs and  permitting use of Business  Correspondents (BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs),  etc.     43. UCBs are, to some extent, already into financial inclusion as their client profile  mainly consists of priority sector segments viz. small business establishments, SSI,  12   retail traders, self-employed etc., who do not get easy access to commercial banks.  There still remains, however, a huge hidden potential to be tapped, given the large  10 number of small urban co-operative banks . UCBs need to capitalise on their  advantage and reap the business opportunity. In semi-urban and rural areas, there are  a number of unbanked and under-banked districts inhabited by people like artisans,  migrant labour, small businessmen and retailers, etc. These people find it difficult to join  the formal financial sector. UCBs can take a lead in bringing these people into the ambit  of banking.     44. UCBs should re-design their business model in this regard and integrate their  financial inclusion plan into their annual business plans. UCBs should give wide  publicity to their services to connect with large population segments. It is also important  that the service provided should be at an affordable cost and here technology will play a  big role.     Corporate Governance and Management structure  45. Before I conclude let me touch on the final issue of importance in the next-gen  UCBs that is corporate governance. The concept of corporate governance is not much  different than the internationally accepted principles of co-operation. One of the cardinal  principles of co-operation as accepted by International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) is  member economic participation indicating contributing equitably to, and controlling  democratically, the capital of co-operative by the members.     46. Many of the problems faced by the UCBs are due to governance issues and lack  of professionalism.     47. RBI has also prescribed that at least two directors with suitable banking  experience or with relevant professional qualification in the fields of law, accountancy or  finance are co-opted on the Board. The Malegam Committee has even recommended                                                    10  Out of  total 1589 banks as on date 1167 are Tier 1 banks, i.e., deposits below `100 crore  13   creation of a professional Board of Management structure in between the Board of  Directors and the CEO as a pre-condition for licensing of new urban co-operative banks.  However, there are still many governance gaps that need to be addressed for the UCBs  of future. There can hardly be a debate on the desirability of a higher degree of  professionalism in the governance structure of co-operative institutions. We will like to  look forward to having a highly efficient and professional management structure in next- gen cooperative banks.    48. Another issue with regard to governance is that today it is typical of our  cooperative banks where the creditors have a big say in the governance; depositors  have very little stake and they need to be empowered appropriately. This will ensure  that they have a direct bearing on how well their moneys are managed.        Conclusion  49. I am sure all these issues are being addressed by the distinguished panelists and  participants during this two-day conference which has technical sessions in the form of  panel discussions on important topics relevant to this theme and other important issues.  I sincerely thank the Conference organizers for their efforts and wish this Conference all  success.    50. I thank all of you for your patient attention.    *************************  14     Sources:  i) Annual Report (2012-13) - European Association of Co-operative Banks   ii) Cosma, S.- The impact of Basel II on Co-operative Banking   iii) Chakrabarty, K.C.(2011), Financial Inclusion - A road India needs to travel,   Article published in www.livemint.com on Oct 22, 2011  iv) Malegam Committee Report on Licensing of New UCBs  v) Sinha, Anand (2012)-Perspectives on Co-operation: Address at the International  Conference on Cooperatives - College for Agriculture Banking, Pune  vi) http://www.icba.org  vii) http://www.globalcommunities.org   viii) Gandhi, M.K. -Trusteeship, compiled by Ravindra Kelkar, Navajivan  Mudranalaya, Ahmedabad  ix) Statistical Report-World Council of Credit Unions (2012) - http://www.woccu.org  x) Mellore, John W.
