Indian Economy in the Global Setting*Rakesh MohanI am extremely happy to be here in this at 99th Foundation DayCelebration Function of the Indian Merchants' Chamber at Mumbai onSeptember 8, 2005. Indian Merchants Chamber has a long heritage – and Iwish them all the best for this year’s celebrations and next year’s centenary.In this age of globalization, I thought it would be apposite to share with you anaccount of India’s place in the global economy. Where do we stand? Have weimproved our performance? These are some of the issues that I will attemptto delve in the present address.In the recent decade, India along with China has emerged as theengine of global growth. This is well reflected in India’s share in world GDPincreasing significantly from 4.3 per cent in 1991 to 5.8 per cent in 2004.This period has also been one when India initiated structural reforms whichencompassed, inter alia, a phased opening up of the Indian economy to theexternal sector. These structural reforms have strengthened India’s externalsector and have also imparted a degree of dynamism to the Indianeconomy. The opening up of the Indian economy has not only allowed it toreap benefits of globalisation but India is also contributing to global growth.Against this backdrop, I discuss India’s recent economic growth record inorder to draw lessons for it to realize its potential in a globalised world.Recent Economic Growth: Overview and IssuesEconomic developments in the recent years indicate a growingresilience of the Indian economy. Illustratively, even as the Indian economywas buffeted by exogenous shocks emanating from a below normalmonsoon and record high international oil prices, overall GDP growth wasalmost 7 per cent during 2004-05. Effective macroeconomic managementduring the year ensured that India remained one of the fastest growingeconomies among emerging market economies in an environment ofmacroeconomic and financial stability. Looking at the post-reform period,real GDP growth has stepped up from 5.8 per cent per annum during the1980s to 6.2 per cent per annum between 1992-93 and 2004-05. Over thesame period, per capita growth has recorded a more impressive increasefrom 3.4 per cent to 4.3 per cent.                                           * Address by Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at 99thFoundation Day Celebration Function of the Indian Merchants' Chamber at Mumbaion September 8, 2005. The assistance of Dr. Narendra Jadhav and Shri MuneeshKapur in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged.Structural reforms have increased the competitiveness of the Indianindustry and this is reflected quite vividly in the robust merchandise exportgrowth since 2002-03 – exports have grown (in US $ terms) by more than20 per cent per annum in each of the last three years. Concomitantly, theservices sector contributes more than one-half of GDP, with growingcontributions from new impulses of growth such as the informationtechnology, telecommunication and transport sectors and a revival of foreigntourist arrivals.A noteworthy feature of macroeconomic management is the successwith maintaining price and financial stability. Inflation has averaged close tofive per cent per annum since the second half of the 1990s, significantlylower than that of around seven to eight per cent in the previous three and ahalf decades. This was possible due to effective monetary management,enabled by reforms in the fiscal-monetary interface. This has had a soothinginfluence on inflation expectations. Thus, despite poor monsoon conditions,record international crude oil prices and sharp increases in a host of non-oilcommodity prices, inflation could be contained at around 5 per cent by theend of fiscal 2004-05, reflecting effective calibrated monetary measuressupported by timely supply-side and fiscal measures. Inflation in the currentyear so far has eased to 3.1 per cent, although it needs to be recognisedthat the pass-through of international oil prices to domestic oil pricesremains incomplete.  We may also note that unlike previous oil price riseepisodes of international inflation has also been contained this time.Another notable feature of the post-reform period is the improvementin the health of the financial sector. Reforms in the financial sectorintroduced since the early 1990s have had a major impact on the overallefficiency and stability of the banking system, reflected in improvements incapital adequacy ratios and strengthening of the balance sheets.Furthermore, Indian banks have done a remarkable job in containment ofNPLs considering the overhang issues and overall difficult environment.  NetNPAs have now fallen to just two per cent of net advances.The external sector continues to be robust. Despite sharp increase inoil as well as non-oil imports, India’s balance of payments has recordedlarge and persistent surpluses, with foreign exchange reserves at aroundUS $ 144 billion. Increased earnings from exports of services andremittances coupled with enhanced foreign investment inflows haveprovided strength to the external sector.In brief, the Indian economy has exhibited a strong performancesince the early 1990s in an environment of macroeconomic and financialstability – higher GDP growth, lower inflation, a resilient external sector anda strong financial sector. All these happened during the 1990s, which wasotherwise a turbulent decade in terms of financial instability in many othercountries. Nonetheless, it is widely agreed that the growth of the Indianeconomy remains well-below its potential. Real GDP growth in the first threeyears (2002-03 to 2004-05) of the Tenth Plan period has averaged 6.5 percent, lower than the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-2007) target of eight percent per annum.  While the economy is doing well in many areas and thesegains need to be consolidated, there are also important weaknesses, which,if not corrected could undermine even the potential performance level. Inthis context, it is interesting to note that the recent years (2001-02 to 2003-04) have seen India recording surpluses in the current account, i.e., wehave not been able to find investment avenues to deploy our domesticsavings. It is, therefore, important that impediments to investment beremoved so that domestic savings can be deployed at home. Of course, torealise the growth potential of 8-9 per cent of the Indian economy, domesticsavings will have also to record commensurate increases. Reforms wouldhave to be further intensified in the agricultural sector, in factor markets topromote flexibility, in bankruptcy and exit procedures, in fiscal consolidationand in physical and social infrastructure sectors to accelerate investment. Iwill address some of these issues next.Although the poverty ratio has declined since the onset of thereforms process, the number of people below the poverty line still remainshigh, with wide variations across states. Between 1977-78 and 1999-2000,the proportion of people living below the poverty line fell from 51.3 per centto 26.1 per cent; over the same period, the absolute number of poor peoplefell from about 330 million to about 260 million, a number that is still sizable.In 2001-03, for instance, India’s per capita income was equivalent to only 9per cent of the global average and 2 per cent of the per capita income of thehigh income countries.With more than half of the people still dependent on agriculture, akey area of concern is that agricultural growth remains low and continues tobe monsoon-dependent. Growth in the agricultural and allied sectors hasdecelerated from 3.2 per cent per annum during 1980-96 to 1.9 per centsubsequently. Per capita agricultural GDP has shown no significant upwardtrend after 1996-97. The slowdown is wide-spread across crops and reflectsa broad based deceleration in productivity growth. The deceleration inoutput coincided with a downturn in world prices, and this has impacteddomestic farm prices more than in earlier decades because of greateropenness. The consequence has been that farm incomes became morevariable and decelerated more than output in many cases.A related cause of concern, given that 57 per cent of population isstill agricultural dependent, is that the role of agriculture in providingadditional employment opportunities was virtually zero during the 1990s.Employment in agriculture remained virtually unchanged at about 190million people during the 1990s. Concomitantly, annual employment growthfor the economy, as a whole, decelerated from two per cent during the1980s to only 1.1 per cent in the latter half of the 1990s. With employmentgrowth trailing the additions to the labour force, unemployment rate for theeconomy as a whole is estimated to have increased from 8.87 per cent in2001-02 to 9.11 per cent in 2004-05, a proportion that is far too high for acountry like ours. The generation of productive employment is, therefore, akey issue that needs to be addressed on a continuous basis.The slowdown in the agricultural sector reflects subdued publicinvestment in agriculture and inadequate crop diversification. A step-up inpublic investment in rural infrastructural areas such as irrigation, ruralelectrification and rural roads will become possible through reduction in andbetter targeting of subsidies that would then enable greater publicinvestment for promoting growth. Efforts are also needed to diversify thecropping pattern to non-traditional activities in line with the changingagricultural demand pattern and making use of recent advances in bio-technology. The process of diversification calls for micro-level planning withemphasis on crop specific inputs, creating proper marketing infrastructure,cold storage, transportation facilities and supportive policies. There is aneed for value addition in agricultural products through processing,packaging, and supply chain management so that farm incomes expand,employment is generated and rural poverty is alleviated. Other initiatives toincrease agricultural production could cover aspects such as betteravailability of commodity derivatives to minimize the impact of pricesuncertainty; reducing monsoon-dependency through schemes like waterharvesting; and, further augmenting the flow of credit to the rural sector.Diversification of agriculture would also provide stable additional avenues ofemployment generation in the rural sector and enable these sectors toemerge as the main source of growth and employment in rural areas.  Allthese measures will promote competitiveness of the agricultural sector,which is so necessary in the current global context.As regards social sector indicators, notwithstanding some progressin regard to education and health, India is still far behind its East Asianneighbours. Our social indicators are lower even in comparison with thelevels achieved by these countries twenty five years ago, when they firstbegan to grow rapidly. The social indicators also show disturbing gendergaps, large rural-urban differences and wide variation across states.Although the literacy rate has improved encouragingly from 52.2 per cent in1991 to 64.8 per cent in 2001 and the overall number of illiterates in thecountry declined from 329 million in 1991 to 306 million in 2001, there are atleast seven major States with more than 15 million illiterates each,accounting for nearly two-third of total illiterates in the country.Concomitantly, given India’s comparative advantage in services, it isimportant that the quality of secondary and higher education in the countryis improved so that adequate skills are developed to realize the benefits ofthe knowledge economy. As regards health, the combined government(Centre plus States) expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP hasstagnated at around one per cent of GDP over the last decade and a half.Total public expenditure on health in India remains even lower than manyother developing countries such as Brazil (3.4 per cent), Thailand (2.1 percent), Sri Lanka (1.8 per cent), China (1.9 per cent) and Malaysia (1.5 percent). Low public expenditure in India is to some extent compensated byprivate expenditure which at 4.0 per cent of GDP is comparatively higherthan all of these countries except Brazil (4.9 per cent). However, low publicexpenditure is a cause for concern for the vast majority of the populationand primary health care remains of poor quality, unavailable andinaccessible. The infant mortality rate in India is almost double that of China(63 in India versus 37 in China) while the maternal mortality rate at 407 ismanifold as compared to China’s 56. Hospital beds (per 1000 population) at0.7 for India are less than one-half of other developing economies such asChina (2.4), Thailand (2.0) and Malaysia (2.0). A significant improvement insocial indicators is necessary if we want to create the pre-condition for ageneral improvement in welfare of our population and for genuine equality ofopportunity.Turning to the industrial sector, reforms which encompassedremoval of industrial licensing, de-reservation, substantial opening of foreigndirect investment and trade liberalisation have imparted a competitive edgeto Indian industry. This is reflected in a resurgence of activity in themanufacturing sector in the past two years, and the present phase appearsto be sustainable, in contrast to the exuberance – which turned out to betemporary - reflected in high growth in investment and production in industryduring 1993-94 to 1996-97. For industrial activity to get entrenched andgather momentum, efficiency in supply of infrastructural inputs will need alarge impetus. The subdued performance of the infrastructure sector in therecent months is an issue of concern, given the sector’s strong forward andbackward linkages in the economy. The increasing demand-supply gap inthe availability of power is becoming the most critical issue in the future ofIndia’s economic development. In the recent period, shortage of coal andgas has emerged as a serious constraint on power generation with thesupply of both fuels falling far short of demand. In this context, given the factthat the Indian economy is among the more inefficient users of energy,highest and urgent priority needs to be given for energy-saving measures,which could include appropriate pricing policies and incentives to invest.With growing urbanisation, issues related to urban infrastructurehave come to the forefront. At present, investment in urban infrastructure ishampered by the fact that local governments are not yet creditworthy andurban infrastructure projects are, therefore, not found to be commerciallyviable. Strengthened planning and better coordination between variousagencies entrusted with maintenance of urban infrastructure would have apositive impact on the overall productivity of economic activity in cities.Given the fact that there is a heavy concentration of economic activity inlarge cities, weak infrastructural facilities impede the growth of large citiesand of overall economic productivity. It is, therefore, of the utmostimportance that the quality of urban infrastructure in the large cities isimproved significantly so as to maintain and accelerate the momentum ofeconomic growth and productivity enhancement. For urbanising economieslike India to replicate the experience of developed countries in the provisionof urban infrastructure, it is essential that all aspects of city management,including the fostering of a professional workforce, are strengthened.The maintenance of vibrant growth in the manufacturing sector willdepend crucially on the expansion of small and medium enterprises thatthen become significant players in the future.  For this potential to berealized, there is a need to increase credit availability to this sector atreasonable costs. Banking institutions need to improve their creditassessment capabilities with regard to small-scale enterprises and small-scale must not be equated with high risk. Recent initiatives of thegovernment and the Reserve Bank, such as the new legislation aimed atdeveloping credit information bureaus will help to reduce information andtransaction costs that should then lead to lower cost of credit to the SSIsector. Empirical evidence shows that wider availability of credit historiesgreatly expands the flow of credit as potential borrowers are no longer tiedto their local lenders.The services sector has emerged as the largest contributor to growthin the country. Advances in information technology, liberalisation of thetelecommunications sector and availability of skilled labour have permittedIndia to reap advantages through the globalisation of some services. Theinitial impetus provided by exports of software and services has now gotadditional support from the exponential growth of the IT-enabled sector(ITES). According to the National Association of Software and ServiceCompanies (NASSCOM), India’s software and service exports recorded astrong growth of 34 per cent in 2004-05. The software sector [includingITES-Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)] now employs more than onemillion people, having recorded a compounded annual growth of nearly 30per cent in employment during the period 1999-2005. The software sectoralso provides indirect employment to 2.5 million people. These data bringforth the growing role of the software sector, but at the same time, theysuggest that for this order of growth rates to be maintained in the future,investment in social infrastructure – especially, education - needs tostepped-up. In this context, it is necessary that public expenditure oneducation should reverse its declining trend: total expenditure by the StateGovernments on education is budgeted to decline from 2.5 per cent of GDPin 2003-04 to 2.3 per cent in 2005-06. Moreover, given the demographicprofile, the demand for education is slated to increase further. Accordingly,the improvement in State finances will enable the States to increase theirexpenditure on education and other social services and thereby improve thequality of overall social infrastructure so that India can realise its potential.It is now well-recognised that monetary policy can contribute to long-run growth by maintaining low and stable inflation. International experienceindicates that a prudent fiscal policy remains the single largest prerequisitefor monetary stability. In India, reforms in the monetary-fiscal interfaceduring the 1990s have been a key factor that imparted greater flexibility tomonetary policy. These reforms have taken a significant step forward withthe enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM)Act, 2003 by the Centre. With the Centre’s GFD/GDP ratio at 4.1 per cent in2004-05 (provisional accounts), the FRBM target of 3.0 per cent by 2008-09appears to be within striking distance. However, with revenue deficit at 2.7per cent in 2004-05, the elimination of the revenue deficit by 2008-09 willprove to be more difficult. Achieving this target requires continued focusedaction on containing expenditures, increase in tax revenues and reduction intax exemptions. Revenue augmentation would critically depend uponimprovement in tax/GDP ratio as non-tax revenue is set to decline in thecoming years. With the acceleration in overall economic growth that is beingobserved currently, renewed efforts on tax compliance should yieldbeneficial results. Achievement of the FRBM target of revenue deficit at zeroper cent of GDP will free up resources for public investment which will alsocrowd-in private investment. Overall, despite the recent improvements in thefiscal position of the Central Government the effort in achieving fiscalconsolidation will have to continue.International crude oil prices are touching a record high. In previousepisodes of such high oil prices, India often faced balance of paymentscrisis, low growth and high inflation. In the most recent period, the economyhas been able to absorb the oil shock relatively comfortably so far. However,in case international oil prices continue to remain at the existing elevatedlevels, they could have a negative influence on growth prospectsinternationally. It is important to note that oil intensity – oil consumption perunit of output – in India has increased since early 1970s in contrast to thebehaviour of major economies such as the Euro area, the US and Japan.Although oil intensity in India is still lower than that of advanced economies,there is scope for adopting measures to enhance efficiency of oil use in theeconomy. Energy conservation measures in the backdrop of high andvolatile international crude oil prices could help the Indian economy toweather the adverse consequences with relatively lower output losses. Inthis context, there is a need for policies that permit flexibility in domestic oilprices that respond to the ups and downs in international prices, albeit withsome mechanism that cushions the impact on the common man. This willalso enable more efficient use of oil in the economy, especially in view of thefact that the rise in international oil prices appears to have a largepermanent component.Given the volatility in the inflation rate during 2004-05, there is aneed to consolidate the gains obtained in recent years from reining ininflationary expectations. While sustained efforts over time have helped tobuild confidence in price stability, inflationary expectations can turn adversein a relatively short time if noticeable adverse movements in prices takeplace.  Credible commitment of policy to fight inflation is critical to stoptranslation of higher oil prices into wage-price spirals. In addition, theinternational prices of non-oil primary commodities may continue to remainfirm. On the domestic front, the manoeuvrability on oil prices is gettinglimited and corporates have a higher probability of gaining their pricingpower with a better industrial outlook. The pricing pressure, if it were tooccur from the supply side, could get complicated by continuing overhang ofexcess domestic liquidity. While the economy has the resilience to withstandsupply shocks, the upside risks do exist.  As such, the inflationary situation,both international and domestic, needs to be watched closely to perseverein maintaining inflation expectations and any complacency on this countcould have adverse consequences for both stability and growth.Global Economic IntegrationWith the growing external openness of the Indian economy, andgiven its pace of expansion and size, the debate in the recent period is notonly on the contours of the public policy in the context of increasing globaleconomic integration but also to the challenges likely to be faced by theglobal economy on account of progressively increasing global integration ofthe Indian economy. The emphasis is of course on successful integrationwhich will no doubt depend on the appropriateness of our public policies andthe private sector responses. These issues are addressed next.Globalization has several dimensions arising out of enhancedconnectivity among people across national borders. In particular, economicintegration occurs through three channels, viz., movement of people, ofgoods and, of finance or capital. In managing the process of economicintegration, developing countries face challenges from a world order that isparticularly burdensome on them. It is necessary for public policy to managethe process with a view to maximizing the benefits to its citizens whileminimizing the risks; but the path of optimal integration is highly country-specific and contextual. On balance, there appears to be a greateradvantage in achieving a well-managed and appropriate integration into theglobal process, which would imply more effective – but not necessarilyintrusive or extensive – interventions by governments. In fact, while thereare some infirmities in interventions by government, markets do experiencemarket-failures and cannot exist without some externally imposed rules andprescriptions of the public policy. As the poor, the vulnerable and theunderprivileged continue to be the responsibility of the nationalgovernments, there is relevance of national public policy – particularly as itrelates to global economic integration.Against this backdrop, external sector policies designed toprogressively open up the Indian economy, as observed earlier, formed anintegral part of the strategy for structural reforms. In this context, the Reportof the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments (RangarajanCommittee, 1993) recommended improvement in exports, both merchandiseand invisibles; modulation of import demand on the basis of the availabilityof current receipts to ensure a level of current account deficit consistent withnormal capital flows; enhancement of non-debt creating flows to limit thedebt service burden; adoption of market-determined exchange rate; buildingup the foreign exchange reserves to avoid liquidity crises and elimination ofthe dependence on short-term debt.  It is evident that the external sectorpolicies of the 1990s, based on the Report, paid rich dividends in terms ofgrowth and resilience to a series of external and domestic shocks.Various reforms in the trade policy regime have unlockedentrepreneurial energies, stepped up productivity gains and improvedcompetitiveness and access to overseas markets. India’s merchandiseexports have been rising at a rate of over 20 per cent per annum, in US dollarterms, during 2002-05. As a result, the secular decline in India’s share inworld exports from two per cent in 1950 to 0.5 per cent in the 1980s has beenreversed. This share began rising in the 1990s and is currently at 0.8 percent. These positive developments in the external sector provide theenvironment of pursuing a further rationalisation of tariffs with a view towardsmoving to a single, uniform rate on imports, say 10 per cent, and simplify allcustoms procedures strictly in line with best global practices. This should helpto improve competition, exports and domestic consumers. The currentexternal environment including the level of the foreign exchange reservesenables such a move to be made with little or no downside risks.While the recent trend in imports may continue to persist in the face ofhigh and volatile crude prices and the large increase in domestic demand, anintrinsic link between merchandise imports and exports has emerged andbecome entrenched. The large expansion in imports is also spurring vigorousexport growth. Given the recent experience, especially the fact that workersremittances seem to have acquired a semi-permanent, if not permanent,character, the current level of the trade deficit appears to be manageable atthis stage and appears to be consistent with India’s growth aspirations.Given the adverse international experience with unfettered capitalaccount liberalisation, we have been risk averse and have adopted a policyof active management of the capital account.  The compositional shifts inthe capital account have been consistent with the policy framework,imparting stability to the balance of payments. The sustainability of thecurrent account is increasingly viewed as consistent with the volume ofnormal capital flows. The substitution of debt by non-debt flows also givesus room for manoeuvre since debt levels, particularly, external commercialborrowings, have been moderate and can be raised in the event of asustained pick up in the demand for external resources. There is also thecushion available from the foreign exchange reserves.India has made significant progress in financial liberalisation sincethe institution of financial sector reforms in 1992 and this has beenrecognised internationally. India has chosen to proceed cautiously and in agradual manner, calibrating the pace of capital account liberalisation withunderlying macroeconomic developments, the state of readiness of thedomestic financial system and the dynamics of international financialmarkets. Unlike in the case of trade integration, where benefits to allcountries are demonstrable, in case of financial integration, a "threshold" interms of preparedness and resilience of the economy is important for acountry to get full benefits.  A judgmental view needs to be taken whetherand when a country has reached the “threshold” and the financial integrationshould be approached cautiously, preferably within the framework of aplausible roadmap that is drawn up by embodying the country-specificcontext and institutional features. The experience so far has shown that theIndian approach to financial integration has stood the test of time.The optimism generated by the recent gains in macroeconomicperformance warrants a balanced consideration of further financialliberalisation. At this stage, the optimism generated by impressivemacroeconomic performance accompanied with stability has given rise topressures for significantly accelerating the pace of external financialliberalisation. It is essential to take into account the risks associated with itwhile resetting an accelerated pace of a gradualist approach. The recentexperience in many countries shows that periods of impressivemacroeconomic performance generate pressures for speedier financialliberalisation since everyone appears to be a gainer from further liberalisation,but the costs of instability that may be generated in the process are borne bythe country, the government and the poorer sections. Avoiding crises isultimately a national responsibility. The approach to managing the externalsector, the choice of instruments and the timing and sequencing of policiesare matters of informed judgment, given the imponderables.As noted earlier, not only do global developments influence India,but the growing size of India has also implications for the global economywhich would have also to take in to account the evolving demographicdynamics in countries such as India. Over the next half-century, thepopulation of the world will age faster than during the past half-century asfertility rates decline and life expectancy rises. In Europe, the demographicprofile is already tilted towards the higher age group and by 2050, this isprojected to accelerate. Projections suggest a turning point between 2010and 2030 when the European Union, North America and Japan willexperience a substantial decline in savings rates relative to investmentwhich may be reflected in large current account deficits. Most of the highperformers of East Asia and China are in the second stage of thedemographic cycle. Elderly dependency is expected to double in thesecountries by 2025. Their working age populations will increase modestly firstand then shrink. These projections suggest that East Asia could increasinglybecome an important supplier of global savings up to 2025; however, rapidpopulation ageing thereafter would reinforce rather than mitigate theinexorable decline of global savings. India is entering the second stage ofdemographic cycle and over the next half-century, a significant increase inboth savings rate and share of working age population is expected. Theshare of the labour force in population in India is expected to overtake therest of Asia, including China, by 2030. Looking ahead, the rest of the worldmay increasingly rely on China and India for supplies of both labour andcapital and this could significantly influence the evolution of the globaleconomy. It is evident that China and India will have to give high priority togenerating employment and both are poised for substantial increases inproductivity.The global economy will have to contend with the implications ofthese developments on prices, exchange rates, wages and structures ofemployment in industrialised countries.  Over the medium term, it is felt thatoutsourcing will grow rapidly and may also cover high-end research anddevelopment activities. In manufacturing, China has emerged as a leaderand India is catching up rapidly.  Though agriculture is heavily subsidised inmajor industrialised countries, such subsidisation would be difficult tosustain from a fiscal point of view, since many of the countries concernedare poised to meet the mounting pension liabilities not to speak ofburgeoning health care costs of maintaining the deteriorating demographics.One sector where the industrialised economies continue to showconsiderable strength and dominance is the financial sector, partlyattributable to the confidence factor in financial markets that favours theindustrialised economies and traditional international financial centres.  It isessential for India to carefully monitor the developments in both real andfinancial sectors, and to frame the policies in tandem with the globaldevelopments so that global integration continues to be a positive sumgame for all countries.While the economic integration of India with the global economy willcontinue to take place, a successful integration, with due regard to theinterests of a vast majority particularly, the poor in our country would bepossible only through sound public policies – evolved and redesigned fromtime to time.  Given India’s demographic advantages, the quality of labourforce (in terms of relevant skills which need to be sustained, reoriented andupgraded in a globally competitive era) and the physical health of theworkforce become crucial.  Education and health, therefore, provide the linkbetween supply and demand for labour through increases in productivity.In this context, there is universal recognition of the need to improveboth productivity and output in the agriculture and related activities to meetthe objectives of growth and employment. There will have to be a massiveshift of the workforce from agriculture to non-agricultural avocations and weshould be prepared for a large-scale migration of the workforce to the tuneof 10 million per year, from rural to semi-urban and urban areas. The qualityof urban infrastructure even in the metropolitan cities, as noted earlier, is notconducive to globally competitive economic activity. The inevitable largescale redeployment of the migrating workforce would, therefore, needinstitutional arrangements, be they in public or private sector, for skill-imparting and skill up gradation.  In these two matters relating to theworkforce, some supply-led approaches appear to be in order, rather thanwaiting for the demand to be generated.Enhanced investment activity, particularly in the infrastructure area,would necessitate higher domestic savings, especially in the public sectorcoupled with efficient financial intermediation. In addition, foreign savingsneed to be attracted and absorbed with a strong preference to ForeignDirect Investment in all sectors though in some sectors like banking, acalibrated approach may be warranted. At the same time, our enterprisesshould be enabled to attain a strong global presence in all sectors. In brief,our global integration has to be a two way process, encompassingmovement of people with some caveats, trade in a free and equitablemanner and financial integration on a specially sequenced basis.Concluding ObservationsThe structural reforms initiated in the early 1990s coupled with acautious and calibrated approach to external sector liberalization has led toa step-up in economic growth and India has emerged as one of the fastestgrowing economies of the world. Notably, this growth has been achieved inan environment of monetary and financial stability, even as there was aseries of exogenous shocks, both domestic and foreign, that hit the Indianeconomy in the period since the latter half of the 1990s. Looking ahead, theevolving demographic profile in favour of younger population suggests thatthe growth prospects of the Indian economy remain strong, provided theirpotential is effectively utilised. At the same time, a lot needs to be done toimprove the quality of life. While the proportion of the poor in total populationhas come down, the absolute number of poor people remains high. India’srank in terms of human development index and gender development indexcontinues to be low compared to many developing countries. There is aneed for linking growth with development and fill the gap betweenmacroeconomic performance and social sector development. In this regard,globalisation throws both opportunities and challenges for benefit ofsocieties. Opportunities offered by forces of globalisation offer India scopeto improve the quality of life of its people, provided appropriate policies areput in place.
