Approach to Basel II*Shyamala GopinathLadies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to be here at this program on emergingparadigms in risk management. As expected of me, in my address today, I intendto share with you the broad contours of the regulatory approach, process andthinking in regard to some of the issues arising in context of Basel II.Basel II aims to encourage the use of modern risk management techniques; andto encourage banks to ensure that their risk management capabilities arecommensurate with the risks of their business. Previously, regulators' main focuswas on credit risk and market risk. Basel II takes a more sophisticated approachto credit risk, in that it allows banks to make use of internal ratings basedApproach - or "IRB Approach" as they have become known - to calculate theircapital requirement for credit risk. It also introduces, in addition to the market riskcapital charge, an explicit capital charge for operational risk. Together, thesethree risks - credit, market, and operational risk - are the so-called "Pillar 1" risks.Banks' risk management functions need to look at a much wider range of risksthan this - interest rate risk in the banking book, foreign exchange risk, liquidityrisk, business cycle risk, reputation risk, strategic risk. The risk management roleof helping identify, evaluate, monitor, manage and control or mitigate these riskshas become a crucial role in modern-day banking. Indeed, it is probably notexaggerating the importance of this to say that the quality of a bank's riskmanagement has become one of the key determinants of a success of a bank.The policy approach to Basel II in India is to conform to best internationalstandards and in the process emphasis is on harmonization with the internationalbest practices. Commercial banks in India will start implementing Basel II witheffect from March 31, 2007 though, as indicated by Governor, a marginal                                                * Keynote address delivered by the Deputy Governor at the IBA briefing session on "Emerging Paradigmsin Risk Management" at Bangalore on May 12, 2006. The assistance of Shri K.Damodaran in preparing thisaddress is gratefully acknowledged.stretching beyond this date cannot be ruled out in view of latest indications of thestate of preparedness. Though the Basel II framework provides various optionsfor implementation, special attention was given to the differences in degrees ofsophistication and development of the banking system while considering theseoptions and it was decided that banks in India will initially adopt the StandardisedApproach (SA) for credit risk and the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) foroperational risk. The prime considerations while deciding on the likely approachincluded the cost of implementation and the cost of compliance.Before coming to specifics I may like to mention that overall capital is whatmakes financial systems stable. In general, expected losses are to be covered byearnings and provision and hence the need to price risk appropriately.Unexpected losses or losses beyond the normal range of expectations needhave to be met by capital.Let me briefly review the steps taken for implementation of Basel II and theemerging issues.• The RBI had announced in its annual policy statement in May 2004that banks in India should examine in depth the options availableunder Basel II and draw a road-map by end-December 2004 formigration to Basel II and review the progress made at quarterlyintervals.• The Reserve Bank organized a two-day seminar in July 2004mainly to sensitise the Chief Executive Officers of banks to theopportunities and challenges emerging from the Basel II norms.• Soon thereafter all banks were advised in August 2004 toundertake a self-assessment of the various risk managementsystems in place, with specific reference to the three major riskscovered under the Basel II and initiate necessary remedial                                                                                                                                                measures to update the systems to match up to the minimumstandards prescribed under the New Framework.• Banks were also advised to formulate and operationalise theCapital Adequacy Assessment Process (CAAP) as required underPillar II of the New Framework.• Reserve Bank issued a Guidance Note on operational riskmanagement in November 2005, which serves as a benchmark forbanks to establish a scientific operational risk managementframework.• We have tried to ensure that the banks have suitable riskmanagement framework oriented towards their requirementsdictated by the size and complexity of business, risk philosophy,market perceptions and the expected level of capital.• Risk Based Supervision (RBS) in 23 banks has been introduced ona pilot basis.• As per normal practice, and with a view to ensuring migration toBasel II in a non-disruptive manner, a consultative and participativeapproach had been adopted for both designing and implementingBasel II. A Steering Committee comprising senior officials from 14banks (public, private and foreign) had been constituted whereinrepresentation from the Indian Banks’ Association and the RBI wasensured. The Steering Committee had formed sub-groups toaddress specific issues. On the basis of recommendations of theSteering Committee, draft guidelines to the banks onimplementation of the New Capital Adequacy Framework havebeen issued.• The Reserve Bank has constituted a sub group of the SteeringCommittee for making recommendations on the guidelines that maybe required to be issued to banks with regard to the Pillar 2aspects. The guidelines with regard to Pillar 2 aspects proposed tobe issued would cover the bank level initiatives that may berequired under Pillar 2.The underlying philosophy while prescribing the Basel II principles for the Indianbanking sector was that this must not result in further segmentation of the sector.Accordingly, it was decided that all scheduled commercial banks in India, bothbig and small, shall implement the standardised approach for credit risk and thebasic indicator approach for operational risk with effect from March 31, 2007.However, the existing three-tier structure in respect of SCBs, the cooperativebanks and RRBs may continue. Currently, the commercial banks are required tomaintain capital for both credit and market risks as per Basel I framework; thecooperative banks, on the second track, are required to maintain capital for creditrisk as per Basel I framework and through surrogates for market risk; theRegional Rural Banks, on the third track, have a minimum capital requirementwhich is, however, not on par with the Basel I framework.By opting to migrate to Basel II at the basic level, the Reserve Bank hasconsiderably reduced the Basel II compliance costs for the system. In a way, theelementary approaches which have been identified for the Indian banking systemare very similar to the Basel I methodology. For instance,a) there is no change in the methodology for computing capital charge formarket risks between Basel I and Basel II;b) the computation of capital charge for operational risk under the BIA isvery simple and will not involve any compliance cost;c) the computation of capital charge for credit risk will involve compilationof information in a marginally more granular level, which is expected tobe achieved with a slight re-orientation of the existing MIS.In the above circumstances, it might not be an entirely correct assessment thatimplementation of the elementary levels of Basel II significantly increases thecost of regulatory compliance. No doubt some additional capital would berequired, but the cushion available in the system, which at present has a Capitalto Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) of over 12 per cent, provides for some comfort.The banks have also started exploring various avenues for meeting the capitalrequirements. The Reserve Bank has, for its part, issued policy guidelinesenabling issuance of several instruments by the banks viz., innovative perpetualdebt instruments, perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, redeemablecumulative preference shares and hybrid debt instruments so as to enhance theircapital raising options.With a view to have an objective assessment of the true cost of implementationof Basel II, banks would be well advised to institute an internal study to make atrue assessment of the costs involved – exclusively for the elementaryapproaches. The informal feedback that we have from banks reflects that they donot see Basel II implementation as a ‘costly’ proposition.However, banks need to ensure that expenditure incurred by them to improvetheir risk management systems, IT infrastructure, core banking solutions, riskmodels etc. should not be included as Basel II compliance costs, since these areexpenses which a bank would incur even in the normal course of business toimprove their efficiencies. Operational RiskOperational risk was one area which was expected to increase capitalrequirement for the banks. The Reserve Bank had announced in July 2004 thatbanks in India will be adopting the Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk.This was followed up with the draft guidelines for the Basel II framework inFebruary 2005 where the methodology for computing the capital requirementunder the Basic Indicator Approach was explained to banks. Even at the systemlevel, we find that the CRAR of banks is at present well over 12 per cent. Thisreflects adequate cushion in the system to meet the capital requirement foroperational risks, without breaching the minimum CRAR.There is also a perception that the capital requirement for operational risk will belower under the advanced approaches rather than under the Basic IndicatorApproach. I feel that, in the absence of details of the quality of operational riskmanagement systems in banks and their operational risk loss experience, it maynot be correct for the banks to assume that adoption of the advancedapproaches would result in lesser capital than under the BIA.Having addressed the specific issues on which I was supposed to 'brief', let menow turn to some other important issues.Rating agenciesIn terms of Basel II requirements, national supervisors are responsible indetermining whether the rating agencies meet the eligibility criteria. The criteriaspecified are objectivity in assessment methodology, independence frompressures, transparency, adequate disclosures, sufficient resources for highquality credit assessments and credibility.India has four rating agencies of which three are owned partly/wholly byinternational rating agencies. Compared to developing countries, the extent ofrating penetration has been increasing every year and a large number of capitalissues of companies has been rated.  However, since rating is of issues and notof issuers, it is likely to result, in effect, in application of only Basel I standards forcredit risks in respect of non-retail exposures. While Basel II provides somescope to extend the rating of issues to issuers, this would only be anapproximation and it would be necessary for the system to move to rating ofissuers. Encouraging rating of issuers would be essential in this regard.An internal working group is examining the process for identification of thedomestic credit rating agencies which would be meeting the eligibility criteriaprescribed under Basel II.  It is expected that by this process would be over soonand banks would be informed the details of the rating agencies which qualify.Thereafter, the borrowers are expected to approach the rating agencies forgetting themselves rated, failing which banks would be constrained to assign100% risk weight at the minimum for unrated borrowers.The Reserve Bank had invited all the four rating agencies to make a presentationon the eligibility criteria and a self assessment with regard to these criteria. Therating agencies have since made their presentations and these are underexamination vis-à-vis the eligibility criteria for recognising the rating agencies,whose ratings can be used by banks for risk weighting purposes.Migration to advanced approachesAfter adequate skills are developed, both by the banks and also by thesupervisors, some banks may be allowed to migrate to the Internal Rating Based(IRB) Approach. The obvious corollary is that only a few banks are expected tomigrate to the advanced approaches – though after some time, and notimmediately. Hence, the small banks would be well advised to focus theirresources on understanding the mechanics of the functioning of the elementaryapproaches and identify the minimum requirements that these approachesdemand. It would be in their interests to take the necessary initiatives whichmake the implementation of the elementary approaches effective andmeaningful.As a well established risk management system is a pre-requisite forimplementation of advanced approaches under the New Capital AdequacyFramework, banks were required to examine the various options available underthe Framework and lay a road-map for migration to Basel II. The feedbackreceived from banks suggests that a few banks may be keen on implementingthe advanced approaches but all are not fully equipped to do so straightaway andare, therefore, looking forward to migrate to the advanced approaches at a laterdate. Basel II provides that banks should be allowed to adopt / migrate toadvanced approaches only with the specific approval of the supervisor, afterensuring that they meet / satisfy the minimum requirements specified in theFramework, not only at the time of adoption / migration, but on a continuingbasis. [The minimum requirements to be met by banks relate to (a) internal ratingsystem design, (b) risk rating system operations, (c) corporate governance andoversight, (d) use of internal ratings, (e) risk quantification, (f) validation ofinternal estimates, (g) requirements for recognition of leasing, (h) calculation ofcapital charges for equity exposures and (i) disclosure requirements.] Hence, it isnecessary that banks desirous of adopting the advanced approaches do astringent assessment of their compliance with the minimum requirements beforethey shift gears to migrate to these approaches. In this context, current non-availability of acceptable and qualitative historical data relevant to ratings, alongwith the related costs involved in building up and maintaining the requisitedatabase, does influence the pace of migration to the advanced approachesavailable under Basel  II.Banks which are internationally active should look to significantly improve theirrisk management systems and migrate to the advanced approaches under BaselII since they will be required to compete with the international banks which areadopting the advanced approaches. This strategy would also be relevant to otherbanks which are looking at adoption of the advanced approaches. As you areaware adoption of the advanced approaches might help these banks to maintainlower capital. However, it would be relevant to refer here to the inverserelationship between the capital requirements and information needs. Adoption ofthe advanced approaches will require adoption of superior technology andinformation systems which aid the banks in better data collection, support highquality data and provide scope for detailed technical analysis - which areessential for the advanced approaches. Hence, banks aiming at maintaininglower capital by adopting the advanced approaches would also have to beprepared to meet the higher information needs.While migration to the advanced approaches will basically be a businessdecision, I would like to mention a few things which may perhaps influence thosedecisions:• Implementation of advanced approaches under Basel II will not bemandatory for small banks which are undertaking traditionalbanking business and have a regional or limited presence.• Implementation of advanced approaches under Basel II should notbe considered as fashionable and implementation of elementaryapproaches should not be considered as inferior.• Any decision to migrate to the advanced approaches should be awell deliberated, conscious decision of the bank’s Board, aftertaking into account, not only their capacity to compute the capitalrequirement under those approaches but also their capacities tosustain the bank’s risk profile and the consequent capital levelsunder various scenarios, especially stress scenarios.• The preconditions for migration to the advanced approaches wouldinclude (a) well established, efficient and independent riskmanagement framework; (b) supported by well established, efficientIT and MIS infrastructure; (c) cost benefit analysis of adoption ofadvanced approaches; (d) availability of appropriate skills andcapacity to retain / attract such skills at all points in time; and (e) awell established, effective and independent internal controlmechanism for supplementing the risk management systems.I hope the subsequent sessions would discuss in greater detail some of theseissues. It is important for the sector as a whole to appreciate and internalize thebasic philosophy of the Basel II, with all attendant costs and benefits.Undoubtedly the discipline of risk management has significantly altered the ethosof the banking as an economic activity. But one point I would like to stress inconclusion is that banks should view the opportunities opened up by thesecomplex financial instruments in the perspective of larger systemic interest.Today internationally, when market discipline is being considered an integral partof the regulatory framework, it is imperative for banks to realize that they areequal partners in ensuring financial stability; and this involves helping build up arisk management culture across all stakeholders. Any distortions brought aboutby misalignment of risk needs and the product being offered to address the riskcan only harm and arrest the development of a healthy market.
