1Changing Faces of Banking : Banking With TechnologyIt gives me great pleasure to be present among you and share some of my thoughts on thechanges staring at bankers today and the role that technology has to play as one of the significantcontributors to managing the change. I am particularly glad that I can kick start the much neededinitiatives by sowing the seeds in the minds of the topmost harbingers of change in the publicsector banks. And the optimal start could not be better than the facilities provided for by theInstitute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT).The major factors of change for the banking sector have been in the means ofcommunication – not only between branches of banks or across different banks – but also withthe constituents of banks. It was this perceived need that prompted the Reserve Bank to establishthe Indian Financial Network (INFINET), which has been in operation for more than two yearsnow. The INFINET has been functioning as an efficient and cost-effective communicationbackbone for the Banking and Financial sector. Having thus established this backbone, it is nowimperative that the network is well utilised by the Banking community. I must mention here withsome concern that its usage by the members continues to be at low levels. The benefits thattechnology has ushered in and the need for induction of networked technology in our day-to-dayfunctioning are all clear before us.The banking of today requires that decision making is done on the basis of empirical data,and in an information age, it is essential that information management uses the best availablemeans for information transfer on a real time basis. The INFINET provides for this and I mustexhort all of you to kindly bestow your personal attention which would only ensure that theinfrastructure built up are best utilised by the members of the INFINET Closed User Group.The first set of applications that could benefit greatly from the use of technologicaladvances in the computer and communications area relate to the Payment systems which formthe lifeline of any banking activity. As you are all aware, payments in India are largely cashbased although there are non-cash based payments as well. The usage of electronic means offunds movement and settlement is still in its stages of infancy. Various forms of electronic basedpayment have been slowly making their appearance - credit cards, Automated Teller Machines(ATMs), Stored Value cards, Shared Payment Network Service (SPNS), while electronicsettlement has been in the form of the electronic funds transfer services introduced by the RBI -viz. Electronic Clearing Services (ECS) - Credit Clearing & Debit Clearing and retail Electronic                                                       1 Inaugural address by Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Conference of CMDsof Public Sector Banks at IDRBT, Hyderabad on November 2, 2001.of Public Sector Banks at IDRBT, Hyderabadon November 2, 2001.Funds transfer (EFT) System. I am glad to note that many banks have made initiatives aimed atelectronic modes of funds movement. While this is a positive development, it needs to beensured that such funds transfers are made in an environment which is characterized by a highlevel of security so as to ensure that no unauthorised usage occurs in the newer modes beingimplemented by banks. It is this area which has been the focus of attention by the Reserve Bank– and the efforts have now resulted in the form of the Structured Financial Messaging Solution(SFMS) – an application which would be riding on the INFINET communication backbone.SFMS would have adequate security measures incorporated – including that of PKI – Public KeyInfrastructure, with encryption software comparable to some of the best implementations in theworld. Usage of the SFMS over the INFINET would automatically bring in the benefits of safe,secure and efficient funds transfers with the added benefit of the settlement of inter-bank fundstransfers taking place in the books of account of banks maintained with the Reserve Bank,thereby providing for finality of the settlement. Further, the message formats used in SFMS arevery similar to those used by SWIFT, resulting in ease of usage by the banking community in thecountry. This secure messaging backbone can be used for a number of intra-bank applicationsalso.Traditionally, payment systems in India have been in the form of individual scatteredclusters with a substantial quantum of payments being routed through the non-bank based sectorstoo. With increasing concern on the existing state of payment and settlement systems in India,the Reserve Bank has taken up the cause for the establishment of an integrated payment andsettlement system to benefit all the sectors of the economy apart from the common man at large.Most of the payment system initiatives undertaken by the Reserve Bank are fairly wellknown to all of you. Apart from the existing facilities such as the Magnetic Ink CharacterRecognition (MICR) based cheque clearing, Electronic Clearing Services (Credit and Debit) andthe Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), the Centralised Funds Management System, theCentralised Public Debt Office project comprising of the negotiated Dealing System (NDS) andthe Securities Settlement System (SSS), the introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement Systemare a few other products which would fructify in the near future.In order that the initiatives which I have detailed have a cascading effect on thefunctioning of banks, it is essential that all the banks are equipped with synchronous computersystems. The proliferation of a variety of platforms – relating to hardware, operating systems,system software and application software – has resulted in many banks having differentplatforms; it has thus become essential to have interfaces which would ensure seamlessintegration across different systems. While the central inter-bank applications developed and2 of  4provided by the Reserve Bank would have well tested Application Program Interfaces (APIs)which would achieve this objective, banks would have to get their internal software ready for thispurpose.All these presuppose the existence of a high level of readiness at banks and I mustexpress that the position is not so encouraging at most of the banks. A great deal has to be done –in the form of computerisation of at least the major branches at the commercially importantcentres. Even where computerisation exists, there are varied platforms across even differentbranches of banks. The need, therefore, of the hour is to integrate computerisation efforts whichshould go parallel to business process re-engineering. In the absence of changes in workprocedures, the benefits of mechanisation and introduction of computers would not fully accrueto banks. Computerisation without accompanying changes in work processes may perhaps resultin increase in the work processes since there may be duplication at some levels resulting in noreal improvement in the efficiency to banks. Further, mere computerisation generally has beentill now concentrating on back-office mechanisation which may not provide any value additionto the ultimate customer who is the main reason for our businesses.It is also essential that networking across branches at important cities be also tackled atthe earliest. The INFINET would be available for inter-city inter-bank message transfers whileintra-city and intra-branch connectivity could be achieved through the banks’ own corporatenetworks. I am given to understand that most of the public sector banks have identified a fewcentres and have plans for inter-branch connectivity at these centres; it would, however, benecessary to have plans drawn up immediately for the other remaining centres as well.Connectivity of these corporate networks to the INFINET to provide for ‘Straight ThroughProcessing’ would be beneficial to banks.Yet another area which is worth mentioning is the relative slow progress in theestablishment of bank gateways and connectivity to the INFINET for the critical common inter-bank applications which are being implemented by the Reserve Bank. I urge all of you to addressthis issue so that all the public sector banks join the select group of INFINET members whowould be among the first lot of users to exploit the benefits of the projects implemented by thecentral bank of this country. This has to be done on a war-footing.Having detailed the major aspects to be taken care of for the day-to-day transactions ofbanks, I must provide some inputs on the impact of technology on the delivery channels to theconstituents of banks. As you are all aware, the Internet is fast emerging as a medium oftransmission of messages between banks and their customers. The Reserve Bank has come out3 of  4with guidelines for Internet Banking and it is essential that these are followed in letter and spirit.The benefits of using Internet as a medium of message transmission has many advantagesincluding that of reduced costs to the banks, apart from the speed and convenience which itoffers.As leaders of the organisations which would be using technology as a cutting edgetowards excellence in services, you would all agree that the requirements outlined by me areaddressed by you in its totality. Among us also, there have been yeoman efforts completed by afew banks; it would be of utilitarian value if experience sharing is reported to amongst the publicsector banks group so that collective advantage is achieved. I am sure that once all these areachieved, we would have attained standards which would be comparable to the best in the rest ofthe world and that Indian Banking can look forward to more rewarding times ahead.Thank you.1Inaugural address by Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Conference of CMDs ofPublic Sector Banks at IDRBT, Hyderabad on November 2, 2001.of Public Sector Banks at IDRBT, Hyderabad onNovember 2, 2001.4 of  4
