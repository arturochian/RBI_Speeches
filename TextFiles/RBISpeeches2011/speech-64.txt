Macroprudential Policies: Indian Experience
Introduction 
1.  Good Morning.  It gives me great pleasure to share with you our experience in 
implementing macroprudential policies in India.  The current global financial crisis 
has brought to fore serious lacunae in the approach to regulation and supervision 
and put the issue of systemic risk on to the regulatory agenda.  A comprehensive 
definition of systemic risk is, “The risk of disruptions to financial services that is 
caused by an impairment of all or parts of the financial system, and can have 
1
serious negative consequences for the real economy.”   
2.  There are two facets to systemic risk.  One is in terms of its distribution within 
the system at any given point in time and another is its evolution with time.  The 
cross-sectional dimension is how risk is distributed within the system at any given 
point in time.  Systemic risk in this dimension arises due to the inter-
connectedness of institutions, balance sheet entanglements, common exposures 
and, sometimes, even common business models of financial institutions. The 
time dimension on the other hand deals with how aggregate risks in the financial 
system evolve over time – the procyclicality issues in the financial system.  The 
dynamics of the financial system and the macroeconomy interact with each other

increasing the amplitude of booms and busts.  The larger is the boom, the larger 
is the bust and larger is the damage to the economy.   
Systemic Risk Management and Macro Prudential Policy 
3.  The set of policies which deal with managing the downside of systemic risk is 
known as macro prudential policy.  Macroprudential policies primarily use 
prudential tools to limit systemic risk and thereby minimize disruptions in the 
provision of key financial services that can have serious consequences for the 
economy by (i) dampening the buildup of financial imbalances; (ii) building 
defenses that contain the speed and sharpness of subsequent downswings and 
their effects on the economy; and  (iii)  identifying and addressing common 
exposures, risk concentrations, linkages and inter-dependencies that are sources 
of contagion and spillover risks that may jeopardize the functioning of the system 
2
as a whole .  While the third objective of macroprudential policy [(iii) above] is 
concerned with the cross-sectional dimension, the first two objectives [(i) and (ii) 
above] are concerned with the procyclicality issues.  The second objective of 
building defenses, i.e., increasing the resilience of the financial system is viewed 
as a narrow objective and is attained by build-up of buffers during boom times 
which can be used when risks materialize during busts.  The first objective of 
dampening the buildup of financial imbalances is considered a broader objective 
and is essentially “leaning against the wind” aspect during the boom phase for 
dampening the credit and asset price boom.  The buildup of buffers should 
achieve this objective by affecting the cost of credit, though evidence is not

unequivocal in this regard.  A more ambitious interpretation of the first objective 
would be moderation of credit supply through both booms and busts i.e. ensuring 
stable credit supply.   While the objective of dampening the credit exuberance 
during boom and, thereby, moderate credit supply looks plausible, increasing 
credit supply during busts by leaning against the wind i.e. by releasing buffers, 
does not seem as plausible because of risk aversion that is likely to set in among 
banks and other economic agents as well as the market pressure and 
expectation from banks to maintain high levels of capital when risks are 
apparently highest.  Thus macroprudential policy is likely to have asymmetric 
impact from “leaning against the wind” during booms and busts.     BCBS and 
FSB are currently involved in developing a range of macroprudential policies to 
deal with the procyclicality issues as also with systemically important financial 
institutions and other aspects of systemic risk on account of inter-connectedness 
and common exposures. 
4.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been using macroprudential polices, more 
notably the countercyclical policies, since 2004 as a toolkit for ensuring financial 
stability though it had used them sporadically even earlier. It would be useful to 
describe the broad structure of the Indian financial system and the linkages 
between the monetary policy and financial stability in India, to provide a backdrop 
for discussing the implementation of polices.  
Structure of the Indian financial system 
5.   The Indian financial system is heavily dominated by commercial banks. 
Within the banking system, public sector banks (majority shareholding held by 
3 
  
 
the Government of India) account for nearly 70 per cent of the banking system 
assets.  
6.   RBI regulates banking sector, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), as 
also the money, forex and Government securities markets which are dominated 
by banks. Thus, the interconnectedness channels, both from the institutional and 
market perspectives, come within the regulatory ambit of RBI. There are 
separate regulators for capital markets, insurance sector and pension funds. With 
many Indian banks having expanded into the above mentioned activities through 
subsidiaries, associates or otherwise, there has been a need for coordination 
among sectoral regulators which has been ensured through inter-regulatory 
bodies within the umbrella of a high level committee chaired by the Governor, 
RBI and with representatives from Ministry of Finance. This institutional 
arrangement has recently undergone a change with the establishment of the 
Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC) chaired by the Finance Minister.  
 
Role of RBI in maintaining financial stability 
7.    The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 provides a broad legal mandate to RBI 
to secure monetary stability and generally to operate the currency and credit 
system of the country to its advantage. In practice this meant the dual objective 
of growth and price stability, the relative emphasis being dependent on the 
context. Since 2004, RBI has added financial stability as an additional objective 
3
in view of the fast growing size and importance of the Indian financial sector . It 
is in this setting that RBI has been using macroprudential framework in both time

and cross-sectional dimensions for quite long without christening these policies 
as macroprudential policies as is the case with some other countries, notably 
some Asian countries. Operationally, while pursuing multiple objectives, multiple 
indicators, including growth in credit and money, are used to track the 
macroeconomic conditions. India being a bank-dominated economy, the bank 
credit becomes a key monetary policy transmission channel. Thus, the aggregate 
bank credit growth has always formed an important variable in the conduct of 
monetary and countercyclical policies.  
 
Elements of Macro-prudential Framework in India 
Overview 
8.   RBI’s countercyclical policies have focused on banks due to the centrality 
and criticality of the banking system in the Indian economy. In any case, 
application of counter-cyclical policies to the shadow banking system i.e. the 
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) is extremely challenging.  These 
policies have aimed at increasing the resilience of the banking system.  The 
instruments used have been time varying risk weights and provisioning norms on 
standard assets for certain specific sectors wherein excessive credit growth, in 
conjunction with sharp rise  in asset prices, has caused apprehension of potential 
build-up of systemic risk and asset bubbles.   In the process, the policies have 
“leaned” against the wind and have had the desired effect of moderating the 
credit boom in the specified sectors both through signaling effect and affecting 
the cost of credit. Evidence, though limited, suggests that the leaning against the 
5 
  
 
wind has been more effective in dampening the lending exuberance in the boom 
phase than in the downturn in ensuring a stable credit supply. Several measures 
have been taken to reduce the inter-connectedness among banks on the one 
hand and between banks and NBFCs on the other, and limits have been placed 
on common exposures to address the cross-sectional dimension of systemic risk. 
Objective of counter-cyclical policies 
9.  The objective of these policies is best stated in the words of Dr. Y.V Reddy, 
former Governor RBI.   “The RBI articulated its approach to countercyclicality in 
its policies by indicating the criticality of the banking system for large segments of 
the population and for the economy as a whole.  Hence the RBI adopted a 
precautionary approach to essentially protect the banking system from a ‘bust’ 
4
were it to occur for any reason.”   This was amplified in October 2005 in the Mid-
term Review of Annual Policy for the year 2005-06, while increasing provisioning 
on standard assets across the board (except for SMEs and agriculture):  
“Traditionally, banks’ loans and advances portfolio is pro-cyclical and tends 
to grow faster during an expansionary phase and grows slowly during a 
recessionary phase. During times of expansion and accelerated credit 
growth, there is a tendency to underestimate the level of inherent risk and 
the converse holds good during times of recession. This tendency is not 
effectively addressed by the prudential specific provisioning requirements 
for the impaired assets since they capture risk ex post but not ex ante.

The various options available for reducing the element of pro-cyclicality 
including, among others, adoption of objective methodologies for dynamic 
provisioning requirements, as is being done by a few countries, by 
estimating the requirements over a business cycle rather than a year on the 
basis of the riskiness of the assets, establishment of a linkage between the 
prudential capital requirements and through-the-cycle ratings instead of 
point-in-time ratings and establishment of a flexible loan-to-value (LTV) ratio 
requirements where the LTV ratio would be directly related to the movement 
of asset values.” 
10.  It is apparent that the policy does not specifically mention ensuring stable 
credit supply though this would certainly be a collateral objective. It is also 
notable that while other available options i.e., dynamic provisioning, through the 
cycle ratings for capital purposes and time varying LTV ratios have been 
discussed, the policy prescription preferred was increasing provisions on 
standard assets which is somewhat akin to dynamic provisioning though not 
exactly similar. Moreover, RBI never used cap on LTV ratios till much later in 
2010 but in a different context. 
 
Methodology 
11.  Ideally, a sound macro-prudential policy should be based on the 
determination of the economic cycles,  assessment and measurement of the 
build-up of systemic risk and also the effect of the stance of other public policies 
like monetary policy, fiscal policy etc., on the risk taking behavior of the financial 
7 
  
 
sector. Since the development of a framework is in infancy, RBI’s methodology 
has not been based on extensive statistical analysis or modeling or on 
determination of build-up of asset bubbles.  It is largely judgmental based on 
trends in aggregate credit and sectoral credit growth in the macro-economic 
settings. For this reason, it has not been rule bound which will require either 
some model or at least some measurement of systemic risk and its sensitivity to 
the prudential parameters. While undertaking counter-cyclical measures during 
the high GDP and high credit growth period of 2004-08, there was no explicit 
attempt to determine the deviation of the credit to GDP ratio from its long term 
trend, though the GDP growth and the macro-economic setting were kept in 
view. Similarly, the possibility and not the absolute proof of asset bubbles was 
5
explored in terms of broad indicators and possible threats . Some evidence from 
Annual Financial Inspections of banks carried out by RBI, together with market 
intelligence on possible loosening of underwriting standards due to aggressive 
lending, was also factored in.

 Risk weights on housing loans of relatively smaller size classified as priority sector was reduced from 75% to 
50% in May 2007, which was not a countercyclical measure but rather an attempt to align the risk weights on 
secured mortgages with the provisions of Basel II which was to be implemented w.e.f. March 2008. On the larger 
loans and those with LTV Ratio exceeding 75% the risk weight was increased from 75 to 100%.

14.   The period covered in Table 2 is divided into three distinct phases from 
monetary policy perspective which correspond to three phases from 
countercyclical policy perspective.  The monetary tightening and easing phase 
corresponds respectively to increase in sectoral capital and provisioning 
requirements (build up phase) and easing of these requirements (release phase).  
The period wise classification from this perspective is:  – (i) Build-up phase: 
September 2004- August 2008, (ii) Release Phase: October 2008- April 2009, 
and (iii) Re-build-up phase: October 2009 till date. It may be noted that the 
monetary and countercyclical measures have always been in the same direction 
i.e. have been complementary so far.   
 
Build-up Phase: (September 2004-August 2008) 
15.  During 2004-08, the Indian economy exhibited high real GDP growth, of 
around 9 per cent per annum. Given the high growth and inflationary pressures, 
monetary policy was in a tightening mode to contain aggregate demand and 
inflation. During this period, India also received large capital flows, which were 
intermediated by the banking sector.  High growth created a huge demand for 
bank credit.  While the overall bank credit growth accelerated sharply (to over 30 
per cent), credit growth to certain sectors such as real estate accelerated much 
more sharply (reaching more than 100 per cent, year-on-year, for an extended 
period April 2005-July 2006 and remained above 50 per cent till later than mid-
2007). Concomitantly, asset prices, especially those of real estate, rose sharply. 
This exposed the banking sector to huge risks. In view of the rapid credit 
11 
  
 
expansion in the period 2003-06, it was explicitly indicated by the RBI in April 
2006 that growth of non-food bank credit, including investments in 
bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate 
sector and commercial paper, would be calibrated to decelerate to around 20 per 
cent during 2006-07 from a growth of above 30 per cent. Inflationary 
expectations had also started firming up and as a part of monetary management, 
the repo rate was increased by 300 basis points in stages to 9 per cent by 
August 2008 from its level of 6 per cent in September 2004. Further, the Cash 
Reserve Ratio was also raised by 450 basis points in stages from 4.5 per cent in 
September 2004 to 9 per cent. In order to protect banks’ balance sheets against 
such risks, the Reserve Bank tightened prudential norms in the form of 
provisioning norms and risk weights in specific sectors beginning October 2004 
(Table 1).  
 
16.  Noticing the steep increase in bank credit to the commercial real estate 
sector in conjunction with that in the prices of real estate, risk weights for banks’ 
exposure to commercial real estate were increased from 100 per cent to 125 per 
cent in July 2005, and further to 150 percent in May 2006. The risk weights on 
housing loans extended by banks to individuals, were increased from 50 to 75 
per cent in December 2004.  Subsequently, while the risk weights on smaller size 
housing loans (priority sector) were reduced from 75 to 50 per cent, the risk 
weights on larger loans and those with LTV ratio exceeding 75 per cent were 
increased to 100 per cent. When there was a boom in consumer credit and 
12 
  
 
equities, risk weights for consumer credit and capital market exposures were 
increased from 100 percent to 125 per cent. The provisions for standard assets 
were revised upwards progressively in November 2005, May 2006 and January 
2007, in view of the continued high credit growth in the real estate sector, 
personal loans, credit cards receivables, loans and advances qualifying as 
capital market exposures and loans and advances to the NBFCs. The 
provisioning requirement for all other loans and advances classified as standard 
assets, namely, direct advances to the agricultural and small and medium 
enterprise sectors and all other loans and advances were kept unchanged.     
 
17.   The tightening of prudential norms made the credit to targeted sectors 
costlier thereby moderating the flow of credit to these sectors.  There is evidence 
that moderation in credit flow to these sectors was also in part due to banks 
becoming cautious in lending to these sectors on the signaling effect of RBI’s 
perception of build up of sectoral risks.  For instance, these measures helped 
moderate the flow of credit to the commercial real estate sector. The credit 
growth decelerated to around 50 per cent by 2008 from a very high level of 
around 150 per cent (Y-o-Y basis) in late 2005 as shown in the graph below.

Flows and Indian Monetary Policy”, Working Paper, Stanford Centre for International Development 
 
 
18.   Simultaneously, as indicated earlier, monetary policy was also in a 
tightening mode to contain demand pressures. Thus, while monetary tightening 
helped in containing the overall credit growth, prudential norms moderated the 
credit growth to the specific sectors. Thus, monetary policy and prudential norms 
complemented each other.  That is, we deployed both interest rates and 
prudential instruments during 2004-08 to ensure both price stability and financial 
stability.  
 
Release Phase: 2008-09 (October 2008 to April 2009)  
19.   The Indian economy was also impacted by the global financial crisis, though 
a major part of the impact was felt indirectly through channels of trade and cross-
border capital flows. In order to mitigate the adverse impact of the global financial 
14 
  
 
crisis on the Indian economy, the Reserve Bank aggressively eased the 
monetary policy. During this period, prudential norms were also relaxed in a 
countercyclical fashion, again mainly following a sectoral approach (Tables 1 and 
2). The relaxations focused primarily on real estate and NBFC sector as these 
were the segments which had been most severely hit due to the downturn. In 
addition to easing of risk weights and provisioning norms for standard assets, 
RBI’s prudential framework governing restructuring of advances (corporate 
workouts) was also temporarily modified to facilitate restructuring of greater 
number of units which had potential viability but had been affected in a most 
unexpected manner.  However, despite the easing of monetary policy and 
aggressive relaxation in prudential measures in a countercyclical fashion, the 
credit growth slowed down substantially due to, among other reasons, subdued 
credit demand and risk aversion among banks as is clear from Table 3.

20.  The credit growth, overall as well as to the target sectors, decelerated. 
During October 2008 to September 2009, the credit growth to commercial real 
estate (CRE) decelerated from 45 per cent to 34 per cent on a year-on-year 
basis, to NBFCs from 61 per cent to 30 per cent, and to housing from 11 per cent 
to 6 per cent (Table 3). The total non-food credit during the same period 
decelerated from 29 per cent to 13 per cent.      
 
16 
  
 
Re-build Phase: October 2009 onwards 
21.   By late 2009, domestic growth began to recover from the slowdown induced 
by the global financial crisis.  However, while the overall credit growth continued 
to remain subdued, credit growth to the commercial real estate sector remained 
high well above the overall credit growth (Table 4). As indicated in para 19, in the 
wake of the global financial crisis, the Reserve Bank had temporarily modified its 
prudential guidelines for restructuring of advances. However, the extent of 
restructured advances to the commercial real estate sector was relatively high. 
Accordingly, provisioning norms on standard assets were increased for the 
commercial real estate sector in November 2009. This was the period when the 
Reserve Bank began exiting from crisis-driven expansionary monetary policy as 
India was confronted with an upturn in inflation – a rising wholesale price index 
(WPI) inflation and stubbornly elevated consumer price index (CPI) inflation.  The 
exit began by reversing the immediately reversible unconventional measures 
such as, restoring of export credit refinance facility to pre-crisis level, and 
discontinuation of special refinancing facilities extended to scheduled commercial 
banks, etc.

22.  In December 2009, as the economy had just emerged from the crisis, there 
were apprehensions about asset quality on account of exuberant lending during 
the boom phase. Since banks were still making good profits, it was decided to 
prescribe a Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) of 70 percent of gross non-
performing advances, as a macro-prudential measure, with a view to augmenting 
provisioning buffer in a counter-cyclical manner. Banks had to achieve this by 
September 2010.  
 
23.   PCR was intended to be an interim measure and it was hoped that it would 
be replaced by a forward-looking counter-cyclical provisioning methodology 
being developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) or by a methodology similar to 
18 
  
 
Spanish dynamic provisioning framework we are working on. Since in the 
absence of a calibrated methodology it would be difficult to allow banks to use 
the countercyclical provisions built up under PCR freely and there were certain 
design issues too, it was decided to freeze the PCR with reference to the gross 
NPA position in banks as on September 30, 2010. The buffer (surplus of 
provisions over specific provisions) will be allowed to be used by banks for 
making specific provisions for NPAs during periods of system wide downturn, 
with the prior approval of RBI. It may be added that the banking system has 
already exceeded the 70 per cent PCR though some banks have yet to reach 
that level. 
 
24.     By November 2010, the Reserve Bank had raised the policy rate by 150-
200 basis points on account of concerns about high and stubborn inflation.  
During this period, residential property prices had risen sharply and had attained 
the pre-crisis level. Some banks had come out with certain residential housing 
loan schemes (teaser loans and 10:90 scheme) where RBI had apprehensions 
about asset quality going forward. Moreover, it was felt that these schemes were 
creating artificial demand for housing loans which could push up the housing 
prices further (which had already reached pre-crisis levels) with the potential of 
putting housing beyond the reach of many. In November 2010, therefore, the 
Reserve Bank initiated the following measures: (i) the provisioning norm for 
‘standard’ teaser housing loans was increased from 0.4 per cent to 2.0 per cent 
in November 2010; (ii) for the first time a cap on Loan To Value (LTV) ratio was 
19 
  
 
prescribed at 80 per cent in December 2010 for loans above Rs.2 million and at 
90 per cent for loans up to Rs.2 million; and (iii) the risk weight for residential 
housing loans of Rs.7.5 million and above, irrespective of the LTV ratio, was 
raised to 125 per cent. These measures are, however, intended to serve more a 
micro-prudential rather than a macro-prudential objective. 
 
25.  Concluding observations on countercyclical policies  
(i) View regarding the implementation of countercyclical policies was based 
on tracking of various indicators in the economy, notably the general 
credit growth and the sectoral credit growth.  This was complemented 
with market intelligence and some feedback from the Annual Financial 
Inspections of banks.  No detailed statistical analysis or modelling was 
used.  The decisions were judgmental based on constant monitoring of 
macroeconomy and were not rule based.   
(ii) RBI, being the monetary authority as well as the regulator and supervisor 
of banks, NBFCs and important segments of markets i.e. forex, Govt. 
Securities and money markets, had the necessary information and 
overall view of the risks building up in the system.  It was, therefore, well 
placed to operate the countercyclical policies.  
(iii) Monetary policy and the countercyclical policy were in the same direction 
(Table 2). Such a coordinated response was facilitated due to RBI’s wide 
regulatory ambit.   If policies are not well coordinated, the costs of 
implementing such policies may be high.   
20 
  
 
(iv) It was important to deal with sectoral exuberance through countercyclical 
policies even as monetary policy, while dealing with inflation scenario, 
dealt with generalised exuberance. Interest rate alone, being a blunt 
instrument, would not have been able to handle the sectoral exuberance, 
or else, the cost to the economy would have been higher.  
(v) Combination of risk weights and provisioning requirements for standard 
assets were used as countercyclical policies.  It would appear, however, 
that varying the provisioning requirements may have been more effective 
than varying risk weights in moderating credit flow to the specific sectors.  
This is because, since the average capital adequacy ratio of banks 
operating in India has been well above 12 per cent for the last many 
years (as on December 2010, it was above 14 per cent), risk weights 
may not always be effective in dampening the growth of credit as banks 
can continue to finance riskier sectors yielding higher returns by allowing 
their capital adequacy ratios to fall by a few basis points and still remain 
much above the regulatory requirements.  To the extent higher risk 
weights translate into increase in interest rates, demand for credit may 
come down. On the other hand, varying provisioning requirement would 
be potentially more effective as it would impact the Profit and Loss 
account of banks to which banks are more sensitive.     
(vi) The countercyclical policies were able to dampen exuberant credit growth 
in the targeted sectors.  However, their effect was asymmetrical during 
downturn.  Despite aggressive easing of monetary policy and prudential 
21 
  
 
measures in a countercyclical fashion, the credit supply did not increase 
adequately.  The credit growth slowed down substantially due to, among 
other reasons, subdued credit demand and risk aversion among banks. 
(vii)  Since the monetary policy and countercyclical policies have operated in 
tandem, it is difficult to isolate the effect of countercyclical policies from 
that of monetary policy.   
 
Dealing with cross-sectional dimension of systemic risk 
26.  To address systemic risks arising out of inter-connectedness among banks 
and between banks and NBFCs (shadow banks) and from common exposures, 
some of the important measures taken are as under:    
27.  Prudential limits 
(i) For limiting interconnectedness of banks, prudential limits have been put 
on aggregate interbank liabilities as a proportion of their net worth  
(ii) In order to ensure that inter-bank market functions in a non-disruptive 
manner, access to un-collateralised funding market is restricted to banks 
and primary dealers and there are caps on both lending as well as 
borrowing by these entities.  
(iii) Investment in the capital instruments of other banks and financial 
institutions is restricted to 10% of investing banks’ capital funds, in 
addition to the stipulation that a bank cannot hold more than 5% of other 
bank’s equity. Though these cross-holding limits are primarily designed 
22 
  
 
to ensure that the capital of banks and financial institutions is contributed 
largely by investors outside the financial system, reduction in inter-
connectedness is also a collateral objective.  
(iv) In order to contain regulatory arbitrage, banks’ exposure to NBFCs is 
subject to tight limits and NBFCs have been increasingly subjected to 
more stringent prudential regulations. Systemically important NBFCs are 
closely monitored.   
(v) Investments in liquid schemes of Debt-oriented Mutual Funds (DoMFs) by 
banks are subject to a prudential cap in relation to their net worth. This 
limit has been placed in the backdrop of banks’ investments in liquid 
schemes of DoMFs having grown manifold. The liquid schemes rely 
heavily on institutional investors such as commercial banks whose 
redemption requirements are likely to be large and simultaneous. 
DoMFs, on the other hand, are large lenders in the over-night markets 
such as collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) and 
market repo, where banks are large borrowers. DoMFs also invest 
heavily in Certificates of Deposit (CDs) of banks. Such circular flow of 
funds between banks and DoMFs could lead to systemic risk in times of 
stress/liquidity crunch. Thus, banks could potentially face a large liquidity 
risk.  
 
 
23 
  
 
Restrictions on exposure to complex activities and products 
28.  Banks’ large involvement with complex products such as exotic derivatives 
and other risky activities like private equity, venture capital funds, etc. is 
disfavoured by RBI.  Additional capital requirements are also prescribed in 
certain cases where reputational risk is considered to be high. 
Monitoring of financial conglomerates 
29.  Financial conglomerates represent domestic systemically important financial 
institutions.  While there is no differential prudential framework for these banks, 
they are subject to more intense supervisory oversight.  Since Indian financial 
system is bank dominated, banks are the holding companies for most of the 
financial conglomerates.  Since 2004, a mechanism for close monitoring of the 
financial conglomerates has been put in place through offsite surveillance, 
regular interaction with the CEOs of parent companies and other entities in the 
group and periodic reviews by College of Supervisors having members from 
sectoral and financial market regulators.  The focus of the supervisory process is 
on management of group-wide risks, intra-group transactions and corporate 
governance. There are prudential regulations regarding Group capital adequacy, 
exposure limits and intra-group transactions.   
Monitoring of common exposures 
30.  Banks’ exposure to capital market is subject to a regulatory limit of 40 per 
cent of their net worth, both on solo as well as Group wide basis. Banks’ 
24 
  
 
exposures to sensitive sectors such as real estate are closely monitored. 
Exposure of systemically important NBFCs to sensitive sectors is also closely 
monitored.  
Enhancing transparency and risk mitigation in OTC transactions 
31.  Recognising the risks associated with OTC transactions, considerable 
emphasis has been placed on their transparency and risk management.  While 
the regulatory reporting on a periodic basis was already in place for these 
transactions, electronic reporting platforms were set up, about a decade ago, to 
enable online capturing as well as real-time information dissemination.  The 
electronic reporting platform was setup in 2002, to start with, for the secondary 
market transactions in government securities.  Such reporting arrangements 
have, subsequently, been extended to other important segments of OTC market 
and, currently, cover transactions in corporate bonds (both outright as well as 
repo), CPs, CDs, call/notice money and interbank rupee interest rate derivatives.  
The recently permitted CDS transactions also are proposed to be reported to the 
trade repository to be set up for this purpose.  There is a proposal to set up a 
single point reporting mechanism for all OTC interest rate and forex derivative 
transactions.      
32.  As regards the issue of CCPs, CCP settlement of OTC trades in certain 
segments commenced as back as in 2002.  CCP system for Government 
securities transactions was put in place in April 2002 while Forex (spot and 
forward) transactions were brought under CCP settlement in Nov 2002.  CCP 
25 
  
 
settlement of IRS and FRA trades is under advanced stage of finalization.  With 
the setting up of mandatory reporting and the guaranteed settlement of OTC 
transactions across various segments of the financial markets, the transparency 
and counterparty risk management issues have been considerably addressed.  
However, keeping in consideration, the concentration of risks in the CCP, the 
oversight of the CCP systems is being actively pursued to contain systemic risks. 
This would be further strengthened as part of certain proposals in Basel III 
Framework relating to capitalisation of banks’ exposure to CCPs which are likely 
to be finalized by BCBS towards the end of this year.     
Other micro-prudential measures 
33.  Several other micro-prudential measures have been taken which contribute 
to financial stability. Some of these measures are: 
(i) Forex liabilities and capital account management 
• There is a limit on overseas borrowings by banks, other than for lending 
for exports.  Limits are also placed on net open positions in relation to 
bank’s capital funds. 
• Excessive volatility of capital funds results in significant costs to the 
economies and has implications for financial stability. While equity flows 
both FDI as well as portfolio, have been accorded substantial freedom in 
the capital account regime in India, debt flows are regulated with 
quantitative and price based measures.  Debt flows are also calibrated 
into sovereign as well as corporate debt. 
26 
  
 
• The sovereign balance sheet has been protected from crisis inasmuch as 
India does not have foreign currency market borrowing and has limited 
dependence on foreign investors in respect of domestic currency debt.  
The general experience of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) is that 
foreign investors in sovereign debt prefer short term investments.  
However, since India has a strong domestic investor base, elongation of 
maturity of debt has been possible. 
(ii) Other measures 
• Banks have to maintain a minimum of 24 per cent of their liabilities in the 
form of liquid assets, largely domestic sovereign securities.  This provides 
adequate liquidity buffer. 
• Profit on sale of assets under securitization to SPVs is allowed to be 
recognized only over the life of the securities issued by the SPVs.  This 
effectively constrains incentives for ‘originate-to-distribute’ model. 
Concluding Remarks 
34.   Macro-prudential approach to regulation and supervision involves a 
paradigm change.  These are very early days and there is no doubt that over a 
period of time, various aspects of these policies would evolve.  Currently, 
because of its infancy, there are several unsettled issues.  The identification and 
measurement of systemic risk which has to be the starting point for designing 
macro-prudential policies needs a lot of work.  Other important issues 
illustratively are: better understanding of the interaction of macro-prudential 
27 
  
 
policies with other public policies, particularly with monetary policy; development 
of a tool kit to deal with systemic risk;  designing of a robust early warning system 
regarding build up of systemic risks; evolving an optimal mix of rules and 
discretion while operating macro-prudential policies; extending the perimeter for 
macro-prudential instruments to cover the shadow banking system also which is 
going to be a very challenging task; defining the mandate and powers of the 
macro prudential authority and evolving a methodology to ensure accountability 
of such authority; and putting in place a framework for international cooperation, 
etc.  
35.   The institutional set up for macro-prudential authority is evolving and varies 
from country to country, the common denominator being that central banks 
typically play a major role in the conduct of these policies. The institutional 
structure for macro-prudential regulation in India has also undergone a change 
recently.  RBI has historically been the macro-prudential regulator. Post crisis, in 
India, as in several other jurisdictions across the world, the institutional 
mechanism for financial stability has been sought to be strengthened.  In 
December 2010, the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), under 
the chairmanship of the Finance Minister, has been set up to deal with issues 
related to, inter alia, financial stability, inter-regulatory coordination and macro-
prudential supervision of the economy, including the functioning of large financial 
conglomerates.  The Council has all the financial sector regulators as members.  
A Sub-Committee of the FSDC, which is chaired by the Governor of the Reserve 
Bank, will assist the Committee.  The Sub-Committee is expected to evolve as 
28 
  
 
the operative body for financial stability in normal times while the FSDC would 
have a broad oversight and will assume a central role in crisis times.  Now that 
the FSDC is in place, conventions and practices will develop over a period of 
time which will, while serving the goal of financial stability, also ensure that the 
autonomy of the regulators is not eroded.   
36.     The methodology for forward looking countercyclical provisioning which is 
long in making, needs to be finalized at the earliest. 
37.    While the BCBS has put in place guidance for national authorities operating 
the countercyclical buffer based on the credit/ GDP metric, it is difficult to apply 
this methodology to India and other EMEs as there is a large structural 
component in the credit/GDP metric which needs to be identified and segregated 
from the cyclical component.  Similarly, experience shows that the credit 
exuberance is in specific sectors which a credit/GDP metric may not be able to 
address adequately.     
38.  Since the EMEs are undergoing rapid structural changes, the credit GDP 
ratio is likely to trend upwards much faster.  The credit GDP ratio in India has 
shown a steady rising trend since 2001 as a result of which the credit gap has 
been generally positive and increasing during 2001-2011.  However, output gap 
during the same period has alternated between positive and negative depending 
on the state of the economy.  This suggests that the positive credit gap at times 
was co-synchronous with negative output gap.  While negative output gap would 
suggest that the economy was in a downswing requiring expansionary monetary 
29 
  
 
policy, positive credit gap trending upwards would, in a mechanical sense 
suggest application of capital buffers.  This suggests that a more nuanced 
approach is required in the case of India, and, possibly, other EMEs, to counter 
procyclicality.  It would also seem that the sectoral approach would be the more 
appropriate one as we have found in India.  It would, therefore, be useful to 
devise a methodology for segregating the structural component from the cyclical 
component in the credit/GDP metric and devise a robust methodology to deal 
with the sectoral approach including jurisdictional (international) reciprocity. 
39.    The issue of communication while applying countercyclical policies has not 
received sufficient attention.  As discussed earlier, the countercyclical prudential 
policies are likely to be less effective during downturns in ensuring stable credit 
supply.    This is understandable because the risk perception is high in a 
downturn and the use of capital buffers for continued lending could be somewhat 
counter-intuitive.  Maybe a nuanced communication regarding these policies and 
the actions taken under them at different points of time can create the right 
environment and understanding for these policies to work optimally during 
downturns.  As the central banks have perfected the art of communication 
regarding monetary policy over a period of time, there would be a need for macro 
prudential authorities to similarly improve communication in this regard.
