InIndiatoo,banksandbankinghavechangedsubstantiallyovertheyears.As we view matters in retrospect, one of the major landmark events which constitutedstrategicinflexionpointsinthehistoryofIndianfinancialsector hasbeenthereformsprocessthatgainedmomentumintheearly1990s.These reforms have heralded a dramatic shift in the way banks functioned and operated in India. The changed overall environment and the internal compulsionstogenerateandsustainfasterpolicyresponseshavegivenriseto thequestforgreaterefficiencyandtheneedtoreorientthebankingpractices. This unmistakable urgency of realigning our organizational resources has indeedalteredthewayweviewthewholegamutofkeyissuesrelatingtoour humanresources. 6.

Whiletheseissueshavealwaysbeenimportant,itisjustthattheimperatives toaddressthemsquarelyinsubstancewereneversocompelling.Therehave been broadly three catalytic forces that have brought about this changed perceptionofhumanresources:First,asthewidespreaduseofthepersonal computerandtheadventoftheinternetinthe1990sattainedacriticalmass, itmarkedaspecificgame?changingpointwhichusheredintheInformation Age.Inthisage,theintangibleassetssuchasintellectualcapitalandtalent haveinasensesupplantedhardassetsoftheIndustrialAgesuchascapital, factoriesandinventories.Thenewrealityisthatpeopleareincreasinglythe principalassetsofanyorganizationandinstitutionsaredependentnotjuston thesumtotaloftheirindividualhumancapital,butalsoonhoweffectively theyareabletodrawoutthebestfromtheirtalentbank. 8.

Importantly, effective recruiting is the beginning of effective retention.

Only a carefully designed and integrated set of initiatives that allow the employeetoalignhimselfwiththeorganisationalgoalsandobjectives,map competencies for diverse work areas, build up capacities through a well? crafted and sustained strategy and draw out latent possibilities optimally would ensure emergence of leadership talent that is critical to any organisations prosperity and is therefore a central element of talent management. 12.
