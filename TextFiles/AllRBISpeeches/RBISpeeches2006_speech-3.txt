URBAN COOPERATIVE BANKS -Evolution of the banks, current issues in Corporate Governance and* challenges in their Regulation and Supervision Ladies and Gentlemen,I am happy and honoured to be here today to deliver the “Late Shri. R. N.Godbole memorial lecture” this year. My thanks to the Shivaji University,Kolhapur for extending me the invitation to deliver this lectureI have chosen to speak today on Urban Cooperative Banks - a key sectorin the Indian Banking scene, which in the recent years has gone through a lot ofturmoil. While the ordeal is not as yet over for some banks, the sector on thewhole is showing signs of looking up. It is encouraging to note that the ReserveBank’s initiatives towards the revival of this sector – a unique sector blendingbanking and cooperation – are bearing fruit. Talking of cooperation, one cannotbut recollect the glory of this wonderful district that we are in today – Kolhapur, aleading district in the cooperative movement in Maharashtra, famous for itscooperatives.Indeed, it is a good time and place to have a detailed discussion on theevolution of the UCBs, governance issues observed in them and the challengesin the regulation and supervision of the sector.I would like to begin with a brief note on the historical perspective oncooperative movement in India and the origin of UCBs, and then move on to thecurrent issues.Historical perspectiveThe cooperative movement in India started a century ago with theenactment of Cooperative Societies Act in 1904. Interestingly, legal status wasconferred on credit societies keeping in view, in particular, the needs of theagricultural sector. Nevertheless, Sir Ibbetson, who piloted the legislation                                                *Late Shri R.N.Godbole Memorial Lecture (2006) delivered by Smt. Usha Thorat, DeputyGovernor, Reserve Bank of India on December 6, 2006 at Shivaji University, Kolhapur2observed: “We recognize that artisans, employees on small pay and otherpersons in towns may very properly be admitted to the benefits of our legislation”.Although joint stock banks opened branches in urban and semi-urbanareas, they did not find it advantageous to cater to the banking and creditrequirements of the urban middle/lower class comprising small traders/businessmen, artisans, factory workers, salaried persons with limited incomesetc. The inability of joint stock banks to appreciate and cater to the needs of thisclass of clientele with limited means effectively drove them to money-lenders andsimilar agencies for loans at exorbitant rates of interest - this situation was theprime mover for non-agricultural credit cooperatives coming into being in India.The main objectives of such cooperatives were to meet the banking and creditrequirements of this section of people and to protect them from exploitation.Thus, urban cooperative banks’ emergence was a result of local response to anenabling legislative environment, unlike rural cooperative movement that waslargely State-driven. The origin of cooperative banks can be traced to a smalltown in South India, called Conjivaram, where in 1904, the Conjivaram UrbanCooperative Bank was set up, to cater to the needs of small businessmen as analternative to moneylenders.Little attention had been paid to the development of the urban creditmovement until the Maclagan Committee (1914) drew attention to its potentials.Interestingly, a banking crisis in India in 1913-14, when no fewer than 57 jointstock banks collapsed, led to a flight of deposits from joint stock banks to urbancooperative banks. The Maclagan Committee investigating the crisis stated ‘As amatter of fact, the crisis had a contrary effect and in most provinces there was amovement to withdraw deposits from non cooperatives and place them incooperative institutions, the distinction between the two classes of security beingwell appreciated and preference being given to latter owing partly to the localcharacter and publicity of cooperative institutions but mainly we think, to theconnection of Government with the cooperative movement’.3Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)Urban cooperative banks, also referred to as primary co-operative banks,play an important role in meeting the growing credit needs of urban and semi-urban areas of the country. They mobilise savings from the middle and lowerincome groups and purvey credit to small borrowers, including weaker sections ofthe society. These banks in India are financial cooperatives akin to credit unionsfound abroad, except that they can also accept deposits from non-members andform a part of the payments systems.Market share of UCBsAs on March 31, 2006 there were 1853 UCBs, 84 scheduled commercialbanks, 133 Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and 398 Rural Cooperative Banks(including 31 State Cooperative Banks and 367 District Cooperative Banks) inIndia. An analysis of market share of various bank groups indicates that the shareof UCBs in total bank deposits is relatively low. Nevertheless, their market sharegrew steadily from 3.3% in 1990-91 to a high of 6.6% in 1999-2000, but thereaftergradually declined to 4.8% (provisional) in 2005-06, as shown in the followingTable.Table 1(Market share in percentage)Market share of deposits of all bank groups to total depositsYear ended Urban Co-op.

As at the end of 1996, the number of UCBs increasedto 1501 and their deposits and advances rose significantly to Rs.24,161 croreand Rs.17,927 crore. The UCBs continued to grow at a fast pace till 2003, whentheir number increased to 1941 and their deposits and advances to Rs.1,01,546crore and Rs.64,880 crore respectively. Subsequently, the number of UCBsdeclined in 2006 to 1853 with total deposits of Rs.1,12,237 crore and advances ofRs.70,379 crore. An overview of their growth since the 1990s is given in Table 2below.Table 2(Amounts in crores of rupees)Growth of  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)Year ended Nunmber ofMarch 31, UCBs Deposits % growth Advances % growth1996 1501 24161 179271998 1502 40692 68.4 27807 55.12001 1618 80840 98.7 54389 95.62002 1854 93069 15.1 62060 14.12003 1941 101546 9.1 64880 4.52004 1926 110256 8.6 67930 4.72005 1872 105021 -4.7 66874 -1.62006 1853 112237 6.9 70379 5.2The spectacular growth of UCBs in the late nineties and up to 2003, whichhad resulted in increasing their penetration, ironically, also led to certainweaknesses in the sector that adversely affected public perception and thereby,their competitiveness. A major reason for the decline in public confidence was thecrisis faced in 2001 by a large multi-state bank in the state of Gujarat, when thebank witnessed a sudden ‘run’ on its branches, following rumours of its largeexposure to a leading broker who had suffered huge losses in the share market.The large-scale withdrawal of deposits within short time had resulted in severeliquidity problems for the bank. The bank was also holding about Rs.800 crore ofinter-bank deposits from a large number of UCBs in the State and from otherStates, which posed a systemic risk. In order to protect the interests of thegeneral public and also that of the other co-operative banks, RBI had issued5directions to the bank restricting certain operations (acceptance of fresh deposits,restricting payments to any single depositor to Rs.1000 and ban on fresh lending)and requisitioned the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies, New Delhi tosupersede the Board of Directors and appoint an Administrator. An order ofmoratorium was also enforced on the bank by the Central Government for a shortperiod. The bank was subsequently placed under a scheme of reconstructionwith the approval of Reserve Bank of India.The Gujarat episode was followed by another major crisis in the state ofAndhra Pradesh in 2002, when one of the largest banks in the state faced a run,following a newspaper report regarding an inquiry instituted into the affairs of thebank by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The bank was in a weakposition, and ultimately, after attempts for its revival failed, its license wascancelled by the Reserve Bank in 2004.The decline is public confidence in the UCB sector deepened in theaftermath of the crisis in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh and concomitantly, theposition of UCBs generally deteriorated. As on June 30, 2004, 732 out of 1919UCBs were categorised in Grade III or IV signifying weakness and sickness.Recognising the systemic risks and keeping in view the needs of its clientele,Reserve Bank reviewed the entire gamut of legislative, regulatory andsupervisory framework for these banks, and in March 2005, brought out a draft‘Vision Document for UCBs’. The vision document, which was drawn with themain objective of maintaining the viability and competitiveness of the UCBs,discussed the characteristics of the sector, analysed the problems afflicting thebanks and proposed strategies for dealing with problems affecting the sector.I would first dwell upon the salient features of the UCB sector and,thereafter, elaborate on the vision document and other initiatives of the ReserveBank for ensuring viability and competitiveness of the banks in this sector.6Salient features of the UCB sectorThe UCB sector is unique in that there is significant degree ofheterogeneity among the banks in this sector in terms of size, geographicaldistribution, performance and financial strength. There is also diversity among theurban cooperative banks in the levels of professionalism, standards of corporategovernance and access to advanced technology. Most importantly, the banks inthis sector are under dual control, with a part of the powers vested in the StateGovernment and a part with Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank is, therefore,continuously evolving the regulatory and supervisory framework for UCBs toensure their soundness without sacrificing their competitiveness. But before,stepping into the realm of regulation/ supervision, I would like to elaborate furtheron the aspect of heterogeneity of UCBs, which would help in betterunderstanding of the sector.Heterogeneity While on the one hand, there are a number of small neighbourhood banksfunctioning for mutual interest of their members, on the other, there are severallarge UCBs with a wide network of branches, large number of depositors andborrowers, many of whom are medium/large corporates. In the latter kind ofUCBs, the cooperative structure remains only as an organizational arrangementand their business model and goals are more akin to commercial banks. Theextent of heterogeneity can be gauged by size-wise, region-wise and grading-wise analysis of the UCBs.Size-wise distributionThe frequency distribution of UCBs in terms of deposits and advancestheir relative share is shown in Table 3. It is observed that at the lower end of thespectrum, 36.2% of the UCBs have a deposit base of less than Rs.10 crore andaccount for only 3.0% of deposits. At the same time, at the top end, only 14banks had a share of 23% in the total deposits. More than 50% of the UCBs (9627banks) fell in the deposit base range of Rs.10 crore to Rs.100 crore andaccounted for 29.5% of total deposits.Table 3.Size-wise Distribution of Deposits of UCBs (As on March 31, 2006)No. of UCBs DepositsAmount No. Share in Amount Share in(Rs. crore) Total (per cent) (Rs. crore) Total (per cent)1. >1,000 14 0.8 25,768 23.02. 500 to < 1,000 16 0.9 11,153 9.93. 250 to < 500 48 2.6 16,947 15.14. 100 to < 250 142 7.7 21,910 19.55. 50 to < 100 210 11.3 15,164 13.56. 25 to < 50 302 16.3 10,525 9.47. 10 to < 25 450 24.3 7,374 6.68. 5 to < 10 333 18.0 2,486 2.29. <5 338 18.1 910 0.8Total 1,853 100.0 1,12,237 100.0Region- wise distributionThe distribution of urban cooperative banks across the country is skewed,with significant concentration in southern and western regions. Table 4 gives theregion-wise distribution of number of UCBs and share of deposits of each region.Table 4(Amounts in crores of rupees)Region-wise Distribution of UCBs/their deposits (As on March 31, 2006)Region No. of % share in Deposits % Share in total Advances % Share in totalBanks totalWest 926 49.97 87063 77.57 54726 77.76South 613 33.08 16003 14.26 10429 14.82North 231 12.47 6389 5.69 3544 5.04East 83 4.48 2781 2.48 1679 2.39Total 1853 100.00 112237 100.00 70379 100.00*Provisional Data submitted by banksGrade-wise distributionAs part of its on-site inspection exercise, Reserve Bank has a system ofcategorizing banks into four grades based on objective parameters relating tocapital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, compliance with CRR/SLR8requirements and adherence to RBI guidelines and/ directives. While Grade Icovers banks with no major supervisory concerns, the other three grades wouldindicate existence of supervisory concerns in increasing degree.  Table 5 givesthe grading-wise distribution of banks as on March 31, 2006 (as per provisionaldata). It is seen that 37% of UCBs in the country, accounting for 25.60% of totaldeposits, were in Grades-III and IV signifying weakness/and sickness, while theremaining major portion (63%) of UCBs, accounting for 74.40% of total deposits,were in Grades-I and II, indicating good/satisfactory performance/ financialsTable 5(Amounts in crores of rupees)Grading-wise Distribution of UCBs (As on March 31, 2006)Grade No. of banks % share in total Deposits % to TotalI 716 39 64941 57.86II 460 25 18580 16.54I + II 1176 63 83521 74.40III 407 22 13879 12.38IV 270 15 14838 13.22III+IV 677 2871737 25.60I+II+III+IV 1853 100 112237 100.00Dual ControlUrban co-operative banks are regulated and supervised by both, the StateGovernments, through the Registrars of Co-operative Societies, and by theReserve Bank of India. The Registrars exercise powers in regard toincorporation, registration, management, amalgamation, reconstruction orliquidation. In case of banks having presence in more than one state, the CentralRegistrar of Co-operative Societies, on behalf of the Central Government,exercises such powers. The banking related functions such as issue of license tostart new banks or branches, matters relating to interest rates, policies on loansand investments, prudential norms etc. are regulated and supervised by theReserve Bank of India. Duality of command is not unique to India, and requiresdelicate coordination for obtaining synergies in regulatory and supervisoryfunctions.Competition and UCBs9Market scenarioSince 1991, the financial system has seen several reforms. The process ofliberalization was set in motion with gradual removal of restrictions on theoperation of the pricing mechanism, especially interest rates and statutoryliquidity and reserve requirements – a process which is still underway. Enhancedcompetition in both banking and non-banking financial sectors has been graduallyintroduced – through a dynamic mix of public and private as well as domestic andforeign ownership – along with deregulation or adaptive regulations.Simultaneously, regulation and supervision of banks, financial markets andinfrastructure were improved to increasingly align them with internationalstandards and best practices. The market driven economy, through deploymentof more capital, advanced technology and skilled human resources, is posing stiffand increasing competition to all traditional institutions.UCBs positionMarket competition and the need to retain good clientele are affecting theUCBs too leading to squeezing of the margins on many banks, especially thelarger ones. The larger private sector commercial banks, with their ability toinvest more in technology and offer better remuneration to attract skilled persons,are better off in fending competition. Understandably, therefore, the UCBs thatare competing in the same space, especially in cities and towns, are also beingaggressively targeted by the commercial banks and face tough competition. Thesmaller unit banks on the other hand, by and large, manage to retain their nicherole through personalized service and informal approach.Corporate Governance issues in UCBsMost of the problems faced by the UCBs are due to governance issuesand connected lending. In UCBs borrowers have a significant say in themanagements of the banks. This has the potential of influencing the Boards totake decisions that may not always be in the interest of the depositors whoconstitute the most important stakeholders of a bank. Also, unlike the case of10institutions the shares of which can be listed in a stock exchange and can changehands without affecting the capital base, in case of UCBs, the shareholders canwithdraw their contribution to capital and shrink the capital of the bank andthereby limit its ability to increase risk weighted assets and expand business.On this crucial aspect of corporate governance, I would like to, therefore,discuss a little about the international best practices.Corporate Governance – international best practices for credit unionsAs best practices guide, the World Council of Credit Unions has1enunciated ideal governance principles for credit unions , which are financialcooperatives similar to our urban cooperative banks. These principles addressthe challenges of organizational power within credit unions at three separatelevels viz. External Governance, Internal Governance and Individual Governance.External GovernanceAll financial institutions, regardless of type, are expected to comply withthe following basic standards of transparency, auditing and financial reporting.Transparency• The board should commit to regular, honest communication of its activitieswith members, regulators and the general public in the spirit of fulldisclosure.• Financial statements, compliant with generally accepted accountingprinciples and local regulatory standards, should be made available tomembers and the public.Compliance• The board is expected to comply in both the letter and spirit of regulation,to cooperate fully with its regulatory body and to comply with national laws.• The board should ensure that the credit union meets or exceeds theInternational Credit Union Safety and Soundness Principles as well as anyother relevant standards for financial institutions.11• The credit union should undergo annual external audits within 90 days ofthe end of each fiscal year.• The audit relationship should be reexamined frequently and considerationbe given to changing the auditor at least every 3-5 years in a competitivebidding process.Public Accountability• The board of directors and management must be constantly cognizant ofresponsibilities to governmental structures, including but not limited toregulators, legislative bodies, the media, the community and the public.Internal GovernanceUnlike for-profit entities, credit unions exist to serve their members. Thus,credit unions must address this additional layer of governance related to theirdemocratic, member-driven nature. This includes a commitment to “one member,one vote,” as well as adherence to the International Credit Union OperatingPrinciples and the role of the general assembly as the highest governing body.Structure• The board of directors should be composed of an odd number, no lessthan five and no greater than nine.• Consideration should be given to the rotation of directors.• Interested general members who comply with the standards of individualgovernance can stand for nomination.• The board should encourage dialogue with general members at the annualgeneral meeting.• The annual general meeting of the general assembly of members shouldbe adequately promoted to ensure sufficient member participation.Continuity• The board should create strategies to maintain the competitiveness andsustainability of the credit union.12• The board should create succession plans for both directors andmanagement that ensure the continued existence of the credit union.• The board should approve a disaster management and recovery plan.Balance• The composition of the board should aim to adequately reflect thedemographic make up of its members and balance the financial servicedemands of members.• The board should seek to balance diversity and experience, but alldirectors must meet the standards of individual governance.Accountability• The board is formally accountable to the general assembly of members,which is the highest governing body.• The roles and responsibilities of the board, committees and managersshould be established clearly in the bye-laws or other policies.• It is the duty of the board to establish strategic direction, approve policiesand monitor management’s implementation of these policies andachievement of targets.• It is the duty of management to prepare the plan and budget, undertakeoperations, implement the policies approved by the board and achieve thetargets set forth.Individual GovernanceIn order to perform their collective duties, the individual board membersand managers have an obligation to maintain ethical conduct and professionalismand to speak with a single voice once board decisions have been made. Boardmembers are also expected to possess the skills and technical capacitynecessary to fulfill their duties.13Integrity• The credit union should adopt a standardized code of conduct clearlyexplaining proper behavior.• Directors or managers must not have criminal backgrounds, recentbankruptcies or penal backgrounds.• Immediate family members should not serve on the board or inmanagement at the same time.• Board members must excuse themselves from participating in discussionsand voting on matters from which they or their family have a potentialconflict of interest.• The board must approve loans to directors or management. All suchinsider loans must be made within the approved credit policy parametersand will be reported on a regular basis to the full board.• Directors with delinquent loans more than three months will be removedfrom their position.Competence• All members of the board should have basic financial literacy, including theability to interpret financial statements and standards, or commit toacquiring these skills through education or training within the first year ofservice.• Individual members should have specialized financial or business skillsand/or a member-focused viewpoint.Commitment• Directors should be willing and able to commit the necessary time to thecredit union. Failure to attend board meetings may result in dismissal.• Directors must respect the decisions of the board, adhering to all policiesthat have been adopted, regardless of personal opinion.The board and managers, as a cohesive unit, would have to ensure thecredit union’s compliance with issues related to external and internal governance.14In order to achieve this goal, each board member has a duty to adhere to theprinciples of individual governance.Competence of directorsIn the context of urban cooperative banks in India, the first issue ofimportance is whether there is collective expertise on the Board available to meetthe competitive challenges before the bank to ensure growth while maintainingsoundness? In today’s context, some of the areas where expertise at the Boardlevel is very useful is HR, IT and risk management. This enables the Board to getunbiased advice from such members on the Board on managerial decisions andon matters referred to the Board. Chairman and members of the Board shouldensure that the Board has a broad based talent in the Board in the areas ofaccountancy and audit, IT, HR and other expertise and experience from industry,trade and agriculture. Domain knowledge of the Board members enormouslyincreases the quality of governance and the Chairman should be able to tap thistalent to the advantage of the bank.The other aspect relating to the composition of the Board relates to‘fit and proper’ criteria for directors. Internationally, the best principles ofbanking regulation require that regulators who give banks licenses ensurebanks are owned, controlled and managed by ‘fit and proper’ shareholders,directors and senior managers. In most countries this is done throughensuring that all significant shareholders fulfill the fit and proper tests, alldirectors adhere to “fit and proper” criteria and appointments by the Boardof CEOs of banks and key functionaries like CFO, COO and the auditorsare approved by the regulator.Role of bank directorsAn important aspect of corporate governance is the role of directors. It2would be interesting to note that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) hasspelt out the following principles that should guide the bank director:15• Understand their oversight role and their fiduciary “duty of loyalty” and“duty of care” to the bank and its shareholders;•  Avoid conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts, in their activitieswith, and commitments to, other organisations;• Recuse themselves from decisions when they have conflicts of interestthat make them incapable of properly fulfilling their fiduciary duties;• Are able to commit sufficient time and energy to fulfilling theirresponsibilities;• Are of a size that allows for efficiency and real strategic discussion;• Continue to develop and maintain an appropriate level of collectiveexpertise as the bank grows in size and complexity;• Periodically assess the effectiveness of their own governance practices,including nomination and election of board members, determine whereweaknesses exist, and make changes as necessary;• Select, monitor and, where necessary, replace key executives, whileensuring that the bank has an appropriate plan for executive succession,and determining that any intended successor(s) are qualified, fit andproper to manage the affairs of the bank;• Serve as a checks and balances function vis-à-vis the senior managementof the bank by exercising their duty and authority to question and insistupon straight forward explanations from management, and receive on atimely basis sufficient information to judge the performance ofmanagement;• Meet regularly with senior management and internal audit to establish andapprove policies, establish communication lines and monitor progresstoward corporate objectives;• Promote bank safety and soundness, understand the regulatoryenvironment and ensure the bank maintains an effective relationship withsupervisors;• Provide sound and objective advice, and recommend sound practicesgleaned from other situations;16• Contribute special expertise in overseeing a bank’s activities which mightnot be available in the rest of the parent or group;• Do not participate as the board of directors in day-to-day management ofthe bank;• Exercise due diligence in the hiring and oversight of external auditors injurisdictions where this is the responsibility of the board (in somejurisdictions, external auditors are hired directly by shareholders).Policy initiatives of Reserve Bank of India          Now, let us now take a look at various initiatives taken by the ReserveBank for stabilising and strengthening the Urban Cooperative BanksTaking a view on the crisis faced by the sector time and again, theReserve Bank, in the annual policy for the year 2004-05, announced its decisionto stop granting fresh licenses for formation of new UCBs.  This was followed upwith a decision not to grant any fresh branch license as well.  It was made clearthat this was necessitated pending a comprehensive review of the legislative andregulatory framework governing the sector. It was in this background that adecision was taken to draft a vision document for the sector to outline aframework that would facilitate the strengthening of the sector and enable it playthe assigned role of providing credit to the economically weaker sections.Vision Document for UCBsThe Reserve Bank eventually formulated a draft vision document, placed itin the public domain in March 2005 and finalised it thereafter, with the followingobjectives:(i) To rationalize the existing regulatory and supervisory approach keeping inview the heterogeneous character of entities in the sector(ii) To facilitate a focused and continuous system of supervision throughenhanced use of technology.17(iii) To enhance professionalism and improve the quality of governance inUCBs by providing training for skill up-gradation as also by including largedepositors in the decision making process / management of banks.(iv) To put in place a mechanism that addresses the problems of dual control,given the present legal framework, and the time consuming process inbringing requisite legislative changes(v) To put in place a consultative arrangement for identifying weak butpotentially viable entities in the sector and provide a framework for theirbeing nurtured back to health including, if necessary, through a process ofconsolidation(vi) To identify the unviable entities in the sector and provide an exit path forsuch entities.MOU with State Governments and constitution of TAFCUBsIn pursuance of the proposals in the draft vision document, stategovernments having a large number of UCBs were approached for signingmemorandum of understanding (MOU). Some of these state governments havesince signed MOUs. The memorandum, in fact, provides the basis for theconstitution of Task Force for Urban Co-op. Banks (TAFCUB) in each State,which is the forum for the consultative decision making process. The TAFCUBhas, apart from the representatives of the RBI and the State Government, thoseof the UCBs sector as well. The MOU also provides for professionalising the auditand the Reserve Bank's role in improving IT and HR levels in the UCBs.The combined access to information from local and national levelfederations of the banks, as also from the regulators and supervisors, has madethe TAFCUB effective instruments for consolidating the sector through quick andnon-disruptive exit of unviable entities and revival of the viable ones.Recommendations of the TAFCUBs have the consent of all stakeholdersincluding Reserve Bank of India and, therefore, can be implemented speedily by18all concerned. In states where TAFCUBs have not yet been constituted, pendingsigning of MOU, the potentially viable and non-viable banks do not have thebenefit of coordinated deliberations on their future set-up, by bothregulators/supervisors. In such states, Reserve Bank directly initiates supervisoryaction as per a graded supervisory action framework, which suggests specificand objective course of action for the banks that are in different stages ofweakness. In keeping with the consultative process initiated with the stategovernments, the Reserve Bank has sought to extend the arrangement to theUCBs functioning in more than one state, through a MOU with the CentralRegistrar and enlarging the scope of the TAFCUBs to cover the ScheduledUCBs, which are systemically even more significant. Further, the consultativeapproach is sought to be extended to the liquidation stage to facilitate earlylodging and settlement of insurance claims.Arsing out of the comfort of coordinated supervision/regulation of banks inthe states that have signed the MOU, certain facilities have been extended to thebanks in such states. Requests from eligible banks in such states for additionalbusiness opportunities, like setting up currency Chests, selling mutual funds,providing forex services, opening of new ATMs etc. are also considered.Strengthening of Regulatory/ Supervisory frameworkThe RBI recognized that there is a need to mitigate the risk to which thesystem is exposed by providing a regulatory and supervisory framework that willappropriately address the problems of the sector as also the shortcomings of dualcontrol. Significant features of the current regulatory/supervisory framework areoutlined below.Dispensing with the one-size-fits-all approachIn order to achieve the objectives set out in the Vision document, ReserveBank of India is implementing a two-tiered regulatory and supervisory regime.Banks with deposits under Rs.100 crore and whose operations are limited to asingle district, are considered to be more closely epitomizing the spirit of19cooperative banking and as such are placed under simplified regulations toenable them to gradually gain in strength, such that, over a period of 3 years theycan be brought at par with all other banks in term of performance, strength andregulatory prescriptions.As a step in this direction, recently Reserve Bank of India has allowed thesmaller banks to adopt 180 days delinquency norms for classification of assets asnon-performing, instead of the 90 days norm which is applicable for the largercooperative and all commercial banks in India. This is intended to provide ameasure of relief to the small UCBs and improve their financial performancethrough lower Non Performing Advances requiring lower provisioning, which inturn would translate into higher profits that could be used to shore up the capitalbase of these banks. Incidentally, about a thousand UCBs stand to gain fromsuch differential regulatory regime.Further, in view of the market risks associated with investments made inGovernment securities, the smaller UCBs have been given exemption (upto 15percent of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities) from the prescribed SLR of25% required to be maintained in the form of government securities, to the extentof funds placed in interest bearing deposits with the public sector banks. Another,regulatory relaxation available to the small banks is in terms of provisioningrequirement for 'standard advances' which has recently been enhanced for UCBsfrom 0.25% to 0.40%, but this enhancement has not been made applicable tobanks having deposits below Rs.100 crore and whose operations are confined toa single district.Supervision through enhanced use of technologyWith regard to the mechanism for supervision, the smaller banks, whichare limited by their size and type of operations, pose lower systemic risks andtherefore it is envisaged that they would be supervised by a combination ofsimplified off-site surveillance system of the RBI and on-site audit by the stategovernments. The dependence on off-site surveillance and on-site supervision bystate agencies in respect of small (unit) banks, in addition to lowering the20supervisory burden of the small entities, would also provide increased flexibility tothe RBI to deploy its supervisory resources to the larger and more risky banks.Emphasis on corporate governance and professionalismIt is being increasingly highlighted that depositors are the most importantstakeholders in a bank and therefore inclusion of depositors as shareholders,particularly the large depositors, is an agenda that is being actively pursuedindependently as also through coordination with state governments. In order toenhance professionalism, Reserve Bank insists on inclusion of at least twoprofessional directors on the board of each bank, which otherwise is essentiallyan elected body comprising mainly of persons from the field of cooperation ratherthan banking. In this direction, 'Fit and Proper' criteria for CEOs is also beingformulated for implementation through the state governments. Market discipline isgradually being increased through rigorous disclosure norms and initiatives likepublic disclosure of penal action taken against a bank by the RBI. Also in case ofgross violation of RBI guidelines / directives where complicity of a director or ofthe Board is noticed, Reserve Bank of India approaches the Registrar ofCooperatives of the concerned state for removing the director or even forsuperceding the entire Board, depending upon the nature of violation. Ifnecessary, RBI also files police complaints for taking criminal action againstofficials and directors of banks wherever criminal complicity is suspected by thesupervisory departments of the RBI. State Governments through the MOU, agreeto take immediate action on requisitions of RBI for super session of the Board ofDirectors or for winding up a bank.In order to ensure that 'arms length distance' is maintained between theBoard and the day-to-day operations of the bank, connected lending in terms ofloans to directors, and relatives of directors and to firms in which any directormay be 'interested', has been banned in India.  Further, as the quality of audit isan important aspect of corporate governance, efforts have been made to ensurethat statutory audit of banks is conducted by professionals. As per the MOU, thestates agree to conduct statutory audit only through Chartered Accountants in21respect of banks with deposits over Rs.25 crore, institute special audit byChartered Accountants at the behest of RBI and enhance the quality of statutoryaudit by aligning their system of rating banks with that of Reserve Bank.Consultative Approach to RegulationIn order to remain sensitive to developments in the marketplace as also forensuring better coordination between the agencies entrusted with supervisionand regulation of UCBs viz. Central and State Governments and Reserve Bank ofIndia, certain processes and platforms for regular and structured consultationhave been established by us. A Standing Advisory Committee comprising seniorrepresentatives of Central and state Governments and Federation of UCBs hasbeen constituted, which meets the top and senior management of Reserve Bankonce or twice a year and reviews past policies and also gives responses onimportant policy proposals and other issues of immediate concern. Thecommittee also serves as a platform for the representative of the regulatedentities to express their views in respect of any regulatory and supervisory issue.This also enables RBI to get a pulse on all emerging issues of the sector.Non-disruptive exit route for non-viable banksThe Reserve Bank’s experience with the UCB sector clearly underscoredthe necessity for providing a non-disruptive exit route for non-viable banks.Accordingly, this aspect has been incorporated in the vision document.TAFCUBs constituted in the states that have signed MOU have been entrustedwith the task of identifying potentially viable and non-viable UCBs and suggestingsuitable revival path for the former and a non-disruptive exit route for the latter.The exit of non-viable banks would be ideally through merger / amalgamationwith stronger banks or conversion into societies that would take deposits onlyfrom members without providing cheque facility or ultimately, through liquidationas a last resort.22Merger and consolidationThe consolidation of the sector through the process of merger of weakentities with stronger ones has been set into motion by providing transparent andobjective guidelines for granting no-objection to merger proposals as a strategyfor providing non-disruptive exit for the weak banks. It also set up a threemember Expert Group of outsiders to vet the merger proposals, to provide atransparent mechanism to the process and impartial inputs on such requests.TAFCUBs have representatives of the sector who also provide local level inputson banks that are on the lookout for taking over other weak banks for expansionof business. The merger process has gathered momentum over the last oneyear, partly because the stronger banks found this an inorganic growth route.. Inall 44 merger proposals have been approved so far, of which no objectioncertificate has been issued for 23 proposals. Of these, 14 mergers have alreadymaterialized.Liquidation and settlement of depositors' claimsBanks that are identified as non-viable and as having no scopewhatsoever for revival by merger etc. are taken into liquidation keeping in viewthe interest of depositors. In liquidation cases, the Deposit Insurance and CreditGuarantee Corporation (DICGC) expeditiously settle the claims of depositors.However, in certain cases, there is a time lag in settlement of claims mainly onaccount of delay in submission of the claim list by the liquidators. Other factorswhich affect timely settlement of claims are audit of claim list by CharteredAccountants, court cases, delay in receipt of liquidation order from the RCS,deficiency in claim list prepared by the liquidators etc. DICGC has put in placefollow-up and monitoring measures to mitigate the hardship faced by thedepositors on account of such delays and facilitate settlement of claim list offailed banks at the earliest.23Recent initiativesApart from drawing up the vision document, signing of MOUs with certainstates and constitution of TAFCUBs in those states, the Reserve Bank hasinitiated several other measures for strengthening Urban Cooperative Banks likeexploring avenues for raising capital, upgrading technology and traininginitiatives, the progress in respect of which is outlined below.Avenues for UCBs to raise CapitalThe scope for augmenting the capital of UCBs is limited. The ReserveBank, therefore, constituted a group comprising representatives of the Bank,State Government and UCB, to study the avenues, methods and scope forincreasing the capital of UCBs and imparting greater permanence to it. The grouphas submitted its report.The Group has identified four new instruments to enable the UCBs to raiselong-term capital/quasi capital funds. These are:• Unsecured, subordinated, non-convertible redeemable debentures/ bonds,• Special shares that are non-voting in nature (as opposed to shares withmembership rights) which could be issued even at a premium,• (Redeemable cumulative preference shares, and• Long term subordinated deposits with maturity in excess of 15 years.The Group has recommended that the funds raised through the specialshares which are non-voting in nature (as opposed to shares with membershiprights) which could be issued even at a premium may be reckoned for Tier-Icapital and the rest for Tier-II capital. None of these instruments would have a putoption but could have a call option exercisable by the bank with the priorpermission of the Reserve Bank. Exercise of call option/redemption in case ofdebentures/bonds and special shares would be subject to a lock-in clause of the24bank meeting the prescribed Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio at therelevant time.Since UCBs come under the purview of the Co-operative Societies Act ofthe State in which they are registered or the Multi-state Co-operative SocietiesAct (2002), the provisions of which are not similar in certain respects, the Grouphas suggested necessary amendments to the Acts/Rules framed under them tofacilitate issuance of some of the instruments proposed by it.Technology initiatives In order to enhance the access to technology for UCBs, Reserve Bankwould consider facilitating acquisition of basic hardware and software forconducting routine operations. Further, software has also been developed toenable the UCBs to prepare and submit all returns to Reserve Bank,electronically. The software has been implemented free of cost in the banks andthe officials of banks are also being provided adequate training in using thesoftware, which enables banks to maintain a database of returns submitted to thesupervisor which in turn acts as a MIS for the UCBs. The stronger UCBs also aremembers of clearing house and of the Real Time Gross Settlement System.Skills development/training, including Directors and auditors trainingTo the extent that it does not lead to any conflict of interest, the ReserveBank of India, in addition to its regulatory and supervisory functions also seeks toplay a developmental role for the urban cooperative banks. In this context, inorder to improve the skill level of human resources and the technologicalinfrastructure of UCBs, RBI in addition to subsidized programs also provides freeof cost training on all important areas of banking operations to the staff and topmanagements of UCBs through its own training establishments as also throughoff-shore training programs at regional centers that have a large network of suchbanks. As mentioned earlier, a software has been developed for banks to helpthem prepare and submit all the returns to RBI, electronically and the softwarehas been implemented free of cost by RBI, in the banks.25Recent DevelopmentsAs envisaged in the Vision Document, Reserve Bank approached stateshaving large network of UCBs for signing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)to ensure greater coordination between RBI and State Government forsupervision and regulation of the UCBs. Since June 2005, MOUs have beensigned with 8 state governments viz. Andhra Pradesh (124 banks), Gujarat (296banks), Karnataka (297 banks), Madhya Pradesh (61 banks), Uttranchal (7banks), Rajasthan (39 banks), Chattisgarh (14 banks) and Goa (6 banks) whichtogether constitute 844 UCBs i.e. over 45 percent of total number of UCBs andaccount for almost 23% of deposits of the sector.As mentioned earlier, upon signing of MOU, as per the agreement, RBIconstituted State Level Task Force for Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB),which is a six-member body with two representatives each from StateGovernment, UCB sector and Reserve Bank. The TAFCUBs are chaired by therespective Regional Directors of RBI and RCS is the Co-Chairperson. TAFCUBsalso have representatives of the sector who provide local level inputs on banksthat are on the lookout for taking over other weak banks for expansion ofbusiness. As such, the constitution of TAFCUBs and their role in the developmentof the UCBs in the state on sound lines constitutes a compelling attraction for thestate governments to sign the MOU with RBI.Regional flavour of TAFCUBSIn order to further instil transparency and improve inter regulatorycoordination, the MoU signed between RBI and the state government alsoenvisages signing of another MoU between the Registrar of CooperativeSocieties of the State and respective Regional Directors of the Reserve Bank.This MOU stipulates the broad measures to be taken by the signatories forimplementing the recommendations of the TAFCUB for each of the potentiallyviable/non-viable UCBs that are placed for consideration of TAFCUB. In the last26one-year five TAFCUBs (other TAFCUBs constituted very recently) havedeliberated upon and made recommendations on the financial position of about250 weak UCBs. Based on TAFCUBs recommendations, supervisory actions thathave been taken include exiting banks through merger with other UCBs,cancellation of license of unviable UCBs and issue of license to unlicensedcooperative societies.Gains of ‘MOU -TAFCUB’ mechanism – empirical evidenceThe impact of a consultative platform is reflected in the decline in thenumber of weak and sick banks in the states which were among the first to signthe MOU and therefore TAFCUBs were constituted the earliest (Table 6).Table 6Comparison of Grades as on March 31, 2005 and 2006 in 3 TAFCUB statesState No. of Banks No. of Banks in No. of Banks in No. of Banks in TOTALin Grade –I Grade -II Grade –III Grade –IVAndhra Pradesh 48 (44) 43 (35) 18 (31) 15 (17) 124 (127)Gujarat 136 (122) 50 (53) 67 (87) 43 (46) 296 (308)Karnataka 90 (80) 76 (58) 85 (118) 46 (40) 297 (296)Figures in parenthesis represent grades as on March 31, 2005ConclusionI have traced the evolution of UCBs, their unique structure, strengths andweakness. I have also indicated the multi-pronged approach adopted by RBI toarrest deterioration and strengthen the banks in this sector, including the recentdevelopments. Our initiatives, we hope, would lead to the evolution of the urbancooperative banking system into a strong and vibrant sector with banks thatconform to all prudential requirements in the medium term and become at parwith the commercial banks in terms of competitiveness and performance. Lookingat this large gathering of academics, bankers and other professionals, I am suremy address would have kindled your interest and involvement on the subject. Iwelcome your views on our approach towards strengthening this important sectorof Indian banking.Thank You.27                                                                                                                                                 References1 World Council of Credit Unions Inc., International Credit Union Governance Principles(Available at http://www.woccu.org/lrac/files/1098902687_Governance_Principles_Overview_Draft_11_revised.pdf )2 Bank for International Settlements, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision - Enhancing corporate governance forbanking organisations, February 2006 (Available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs122.htm )
