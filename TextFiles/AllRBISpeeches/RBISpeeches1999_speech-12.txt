*Raju, Dr. Y.R.K. I am thankful to the organisers for giving me this opportunity to be with you.  In a way, I am a part of the Administrative Staff College, since I had spent oneyear in the late ‘eighties as a full-time visiting fellow, doing some work on; apart from the fact that I have been visiting the collegeon and off since the ‘sixties. So, there is no way in which I could have avoided theresponsibility of responding to the invitation .  But, more important, it was a commandfrom Chairman of Staff College, Mr. Narasimham, my guru; and unfortunately we aregoing to miss him here today, since he is indisposed. Today’s subject, corporategovernance, is not merely fashionable now a days, but extremely relevant for us inThe literature on corporate governance in its wide connotation covers a variety ofaspects, such as protection of shareholders’ rights, enhancing shareholders’ value,Board issues including its composition and role, disclosure requirements, the integrityof accounting practices, the control systems, in particular the internal control systems,insider trading and, what is described as self-dealing with which we are not entirelyunfamiliar in our country. All these would certainly be debated by the set ofA second area which is perhaps of special interest to Mumbai , being the financialcentre is the role of financial intermediaries in the corporate governance.  This areahas attracted a lot of attention in the recent past all over the world. In our country also,particularly in the last few months, there has been intense discussion on the role offinancial intermediaries in corporate governance.  Recently, the Unit Trust of India(UTI) held a seminar on Corporate Governance and Securities and Exchange Board ofIndia (SEBI) is having a group working on it.  The Confederation of Indian Industries(CII) and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India(ASSOCHAM) have also been involved in the debate though their focus was ongovernance in general.  The role of financial intermediaries in corporate sector isoften discussed in terms of the Anglo Saxon model or the Continental model.Familiar issues in literature on this subject relate to the role of creditor in corporategovernance, the possible conflict between the role as a creditor and role as equityholder when financial intermediaries have exposure on both counts and, the issue oftheir representation on the Board on which there is currently a considerable debate inour country.  Self-dealing, most certainly, is another area of concern and presumably                                                          privatisationthis would also be considered in detail by this gathering.Role of Financial Intermediariesprofessionals who are to interact here.Corporate GovernanceIndia for a variety of reasons. and liberalisationtodayReddy and friends, Yerram Dr. Corporate Governance in Financial SectorA third and an area of particular relevance to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)relates to corporate governance in the financial sector.  Today, therefore, the majorfocus of this presentation would relate to corporate governance in the financial sectorIt is possible to broadly identify different sets of players in the corporategovernance system. For convenience they can be identified as law which is the legalsystem; regulators; the Board of Directors and Executive Directors on the Board;financial intermediaries; markets; and self regulatory organisations.  There is adynamic balance among them that determines the prevailing corporate governancesystem, and the balance varies from country to country.  In some countries, self-regulatory organisations are well established and in others, as you are aware, thefinancial intermediaries play a greater part.  These balances vary from country tocountry and, vary depending upon the stage of institutional development and thehistorical context. Since financial intermediaries are important players in corporategovernance in India, special focus on the corporate governance in the financial sectorSecondly, the RBI, as regulator relevant to financial sector, has responsibilityon the nature of corporate governance in the financial sector.

In the pre-reformperiod, most decisions were externally, i.e., external to the financial intermediarydetermined including interest rates to be paid or charged and whom to lend.  Butrecently, there has been a movement away from micro regulation by the RBI.  Thereis thus, a shift from external regulation to the internal systems and therefore, thequality of the corporate governance within the bank or financial institution becomescritical in the performance of the financial sector and indeed the growth of financialIn this perspective of the significance of corporate governance in the financialitself.sector in India, the rest of the presentation is divided into three parts.sector.corporate governance in private sector.corporate governance in the banks is of critical importance to the RBI.the financial sector reforms that are being undertaken.itself becomes critical.Financial SectorCorporate Governance inThe first relates to corporate governance in Government owned financialintermediaries, i.e., the nature of the corporate governance in the context of theThe second set relates to corporate governance and regulatory issues inThe third part identifies the areas that require attention, taking into account notonly the ownership and regulatory aspects but also the total systemic requirements.The evolving corporate governance system in Government owned banks andFirst, public ownership is dominant in our financial sector and it is likely to bedominant for quite sometime in future in India .  So, it sets a benchmark for theSecond, the whole concept of competition in banking will have to be viewedin the light of the government ownership .  If the regulator is trying to encouragecompetition, such encouragement of competition is possible if the market players i.e.,banks concerned, are willing to respond to the competitive impulses that the regulatoris trying to induce. It is possible that the nature of corporate arrangements and natureof incentive framework in the public sector banks are such the regulatory initiativeswill not get the desired response or results. Consequently, the regulator’s inclinationor pressure to create an incentive framework for introducing competition would alsobe determined by the extent to which the corporate governance in public sectorA third factor is diversified ownership in many public sector financialintermediaries, both the banks and financial institutions. The government is no longer100 per cent owner in all public sector organisations .  In organisations where therehas been some divestment, it owns directly or indirectly about 55 to 70 per cent .  Theexistence of private shareholders implies that issues like enhancing shareholdersvalue, protecting shareholders value and protecting shareholders rights becomeextremely important .  Such a situation did not exist in most of the public sector andfinancial sector until a few years back .  The issue is whether this transformation inownership pattern of the financial system has been captured in changing theA fourth factor is that if the financial sector, in particular banking system, hasto develop in a healthy manner there is need for additional funding of theseinstitutions.

The issue,therefore, is how our public sector financial institutions have been performing interms of enhancing shareholder values .  This is extremely important from systempoint of view because, additional funding has to be provided either by theGovernment or by the private shareholder .  Given the fiscal position, the Governmentcannot be expected to invest significant funds in recapitalising public sector financialorganisations. In brief, Government as an owner has to appreciate the importance ofenhancing shareholder value, to reduce the possible fiscal burden of funding ofbanking or financial institutions in future and so attention to corporate governance inpublic sector is relevant from overall fiscal point of view also – whether for additionalFifth, there is the issue of mixing up of regulatory, sovereign and, ownershipfunctions and at the same time ensuring a viable system of corporate governance .  Areference has been made to this in the Narasimham Committee Report on BankingSector Reforms ( Narasimham Committee II) Banking Sector Reforms and morerecently in the Discussion Paper on Harmonising the Role and Operations ofDevelopment Financial Institutions and Banks (Discussion Paper on UniversalBanking), circulated by the Reserve Bank of India .  For instance, as the Committee (II) has highlighted, in the case of the State Bank of India, the RBI is bothregulator and owner .  Also, ownership and regulatory functions are mixed up in theThis situation of public ownership and mixing up of issues without identifiableprinciples of corporate governance is not typical of the Indian situation alone .  It isquite common, and the OECD in a recent document on “corporate governance  SOEs“The weaknesses of governance in state owned enterprises stem frominsufficient market-related incentives and disciplines.

In this context, the OECD, document, after discussing theassets at least in the medium term.  It is, therefore, important to identify bestThus, even if privatisation or divestment is resorted to, we cannot ignore thefact that corporate governance in public enterprises needs to be improved.

In fact, the international experience of thelast one or two years, especially in Asia, has shown that macro level policy reformsby themselves are inadequate. The micro level reforms, institutional reforms andcorporate governance issues have become even more important than what they werean year ago .  Therefore, perhaps one cannot be content with simply implementingwhat the Narasimham Committee (II) has said, and one may have to look at theseissues more closely now. Relevant issues that come to one’s mind, in a somewhatThe first one relates to the organisational set up .  The question is, be it a bankor financial institution, if it is in competition with other institutions and more so if it ishaving private shareholders, should it be registered under Companies Act or should itbe under a separate statute ?  A separate statute other than Companies Act is justifiedonly when there are governmental-regulatory or statutory-monopoly functionsStatutory form, when inappropriate causes avoidable burden onParliament/legislature, on bureaucracy in government and on the enterprise itselfThe private shareholders often lose many of the privileges of minority shareholders ina statutory form .  In fact, the Narasimham Committee had recommended that theIDBI should be .  By the same logic, public sector banks would also needSecond, even conceding that there is need f or a separate statute, is there needfor a number of Acts ?  Incidentally, as far as banks are concerned, there are more thanone, viz., State Bank of India Act, State Bank (Subsidiaries) Act and NationalisedBanks Act .  While these Acts contain many provisions which are common there are aThird, even assuming that banks are brought under the Companies Act, there iscurrently a difference in treatment between a Government-owned company, inCompanies Act and other companies in Companies Act .  Should there be a categorycalled Government-company, which can be very transient particularly since theconcept of diversified ownership or transfer of ownership, is accepted?Fourth, Narasimham Committee (II) also raised a question whether regulators shouldbe owners in the context of State Bank of India. RBI’s discussion paper on UniversalBanking has gone farther and expressed itself in favour of divesting its ownership inrefinance institutions also .  To implement the change in ownership mostexpeditiously, RBI has advocated transfer of ownership to Government, sinceGovernment could, in due course, consider divestment. It may be of interest to notethat barring one Director, others are nominated by Government and not by the RBI..number of provisions which are different which render overall policy difficult.corporatised. to be corporatisedrandom fashion are the following:Government Ownership: IssuesCorporate Governance andwhether there is need for a set of the best practices for all financial intermediaries.even when the RBI owns majority or totality of shareholding in SBI and refinancingfinancial institutions. Incidentally, RBI had vacated its majority ownership role inSecurities Trading Corporation of India Ltd. and Discount and Finance House of IndiaThe fifth issue is whether regulators should be on the Board of the regulated. On firstprinciples, there is no justification for a regulator like RBI to be represented on theBoard at all – irrespective of whether it is public sector or private sector; profitmaking or loss making; well run or not .  This view was also expressed in both theThe sixth one is the nature of Board level repr esentation. Since financialintermediaries were created merely as instrumental arms of the planning system,Board level representation was determined by the statutes in a way that they representthe totality of the public interest in the system .  The concept of the shareholder whohas to get the value for his shares was not the major focus of the statute .  Withdiversified ownership, amendments have been carried out whereby there is somerepresentation for the private shareholders .  However, the amendments, by and large,indicate that even with 40 per cent private shareholding, private shareholders’representation on the Board may be restricted to 10 or 15 per cent of the members inthe Board. There is need to review and take a stand on a reasonable Board levelrepresentation for private shareholders when there is mixed ownership betweenSeventh relates to the categories of Executive and non-Executive Directorsand the proportion between them .  This issue also had been flagged by Committee (II). There is no reason why each nationalised bank should have only twoBoard level Executives including the chairman. And by all account the presentproportion between Executives and others in public sector banks and financialinstitutions is inconsistent with the international practices. Further, these Executivesare appointed by the Government and they are accountable only to Government, theEighth pertains to the representation in various Board commi ttees, such as themanagement committee, and audit committee. Again, one needs to review the extentto which their composition is consistent with the best practices for corporateNinth, these institutions operate under various regulations, ru les, anddirections of Government on many purely managerial issues even when there areprivate shareholders. The whole concept of corporate governance is based on what isknown as Board run companies, and the question is whether public sector banks orfinancial institutions are Board run companies or not and if not, whether they shouldTenth concerns the role of Annual General Meeting (AGM) .  The statutoryprovisions may not reflect the generally accepted role of AGM, say on appointment ofstatutory auditors, etc .  There are also questions about dispensing with the approval ofannual accounts by AGM .  In other words, just as the role of Board needs to beNarasimhambe.governance.majority shareholder.Government and the private sector.Narasimham Committee reports.Ltd., and is in the process of total divestment.reviewed when there are private shareholders, the role of AGM should also beThe eleventh issue is of Board appointments in terms of transparency and.   What exactly are the considerations of Government in making Boardlevel appointments ?  One of the suggestions in respect of banks was that for Boardrepresentation, there should be some sort of panel or certification. In this regard, itmay be of interest to know that in April, the ‘Economist’ came out with anadvertisement for suggestion for Board of Directors, i.e., non-official Board ofDirectors in Bank of England .  That is the type of transparency that the world ismoving to. If one wants the best talent in the country, and one is looking forprofessional Directors, perhaps there should be a process of transparent search, whichensures the required qualifications to start with, apart from attempting to ensureimparting of appropriate skills .  Accountability of Directors in Public Sector banks isyet another aspect on which processes have to be put in place. Indeed the challengesmay include making aware what Directors nominated to Boards are expected to do onthe Boards; monitoring their actual performance and keeping a track of these whileThe twelfth and a well recognised aspect relates to timeliness of appointmentof members of Board, whether it is Executive or non-Executive. It sometimes takes anumber of years, if not decades, to reconstitute the Boards of some public sectorThere is also an issue of ensuring continuity of the Board and making itcounter cyclical to the political development. If all the Board Directors are appointedat one time and given one tenure, then all of them would vacate at one go and therewould be no continuity unless at least some are .   There are very fewcorporates where almost the whole Board gets replaced overnight. No doubt, it is dueto the nature of political system that such things happen and for this reason there arestandard practices in many countries where vacancies are filled in a way that iscounter cyclical to the political system. For example, there could be an agreedpractice with regard to a third of the Board members being appointed, say, every oneFinally, the imposition or perception of the imposition of decisions on corporates bythe dominant owner can influence the shareholders value .  In regard to some of thetransactions of public sector units, in the recent past, there was a perception thatGovernment as majority shareholder is imposing decision on the corporate withoutreference to Board’s view of its interest in the matter. Such perceptions seem to haveThus, on the basis of this presentation, I propose for your discussion two.  The first, is to undertake a thorough review of the law and organisationalset up in regard to the publicly owned financial institutions to make them consistentwith good corporate governance practices, some of which have been hinted byNarasimham Committee (II). It is a question of taking up the issue in a morefundamental and broader sense than what was contemplated by Committee (II). The second is to consider whether a code of best practices forgovernment owned enterprises would be desirable because if Government has to beNarasimhamsuggestionseroded shareholder value in some cases.or two years for a tenure of, say, three or six years.renominatedbanks.considering future appointments.accountabilityreviewed to ensure consistency with the best corporate practice.model employer, presumably Government should also be a model corporategovernance practitioner .  Such a code will help all Ministries and functionariesOn the issue of regulation of financial sector and corporate governance infinancial sector, Shri Talwar, Deputy Governor will address the gathering in detail.Hence, the presentation on this will be somewhat brief.  In fact, NarasimhamCommittee (II) itself had covered a significant part of relevant ground.  The majorthrust of the RBI as regulator in the context of corporate governance was highlightedin Dr. Rangarajan’s speech published in The Banker in October 1997. More recently,Governor Jalan’s Monetary Policy statements of April and October 1998 do coverFirst, corporate governance in Financial Institutions ( FIs) needs urgent attention.  Adiscussion paper on the subject by Shri Khan, former Chairman, IndustrialDevelopment Bank of India (IDBI), brings out the urgency, the seriousness and apossible approach very clearly. The salient points in the discussion paper could beThe Board of Directors of any institution may ideally consist of 12 to 15 Directors,filled with persons of proven competence and high professional calibre. Of theDirectors, at least, two-third should be non-Executive Directors and a majority ofthem should be independent of the institution as well as of the Government. The Executive Directors are to be appointed for an initial term of three and re-appointedfor an additional maximum term of three years. The roles of the Chairman and of theChief Executive Officer should be separated and the Chairman should ideally be anon-Executive Director. The appointment of the Chief Executive Officer and otherwhole-time Directors should be left to the Board of Directors with the help of aNomination Committee .  A Nomination Committee comprising of Directors (majorityof whom shall be non-Executive Directors) chaired by the Chairman should have theresponsibility of proposing to the Board new appointments (both Executive and non-Executive Directors) .  A nominee of the Government of India or any of theinstitutional shareholders, having a stake of more than 26 per cent could berepresented on the Nomination Committee without any veto power .  The Committeesof the Board dealing with credit/investment should have fair number of independentDirectors while Audit Committee comprising entirely of independent non-ExecutiveDirectors should be compulsory .  The Board of Directors assisted by a CompensationCommittee of the Board consisting of non-Executive Directors headed by theChairman should be the final authority to decide on the compensation payable to staff.The level of disclosures to the public needs to be significantly improved, and thedisclosures to be made with Board approval, say with quarterly intervals, shouldinclude fourteen listed aspects .  The financial institutions should be brought fullyunder the regulatory and supervisory ambit of the Reserve Bank of India. The ReserveBank of India/Department of Supervision needs to devise suitable tools/norms forfinancial institution regulation/supervision consistent with the nature of theiroperations. The accountability of the management should be only to the General Bodyof the shareholders .  The practice of separate supervision/monitoring of operations offinancial institutions by the Government should be dispensed with.non-summarised as follows:subsequent developments.  In this presentation, I will emphasise a few aspects only.Regulatory Issues and Corporate Governancecontribute to enhancing corporate governance in public sector.The concluding part of Shri Khan’s paper is of special significance to the issue ofappropriate regulatory framework for financial institution, and some indication aboutthe RBI’s approach is available in the Discussion Paper on Universal BankingSecond, RBI’s approach to regulation in the recent past has some features that wouldenhance the need for and usefulness of good corporate governance in financial sectorThe transparency aspect has been emphasised by expanding the coverage ofinformation, timeliness of such information and analytical content, in RBI’s monthlyBulletin and Weekly Statistical Supplement .  Similar improvements have been madein Annual Report and Trend and Progress in Banking. Further, interaction with marketparticipants and academics are more intense now than before, both at informal leveland formal fora like advisory committees .  Moreover, RBI is encouraging interactionwith and where needed, guiding self-regulatory organisations such as Primary Dealers.  This should aid the process of replacing external regulatory pressureswith peer pressure or internal pressures, in addition to market pressures towards soundcorporate practices .  In this process, RBI may have to play increasingly active role inreinforcing voluntary acceptance of code of best practices and encouraging self-Third, with globalisation, the regulatory practices have to closely follow internationalpractices, with appropriate modifications .  The recently circulated draft guidelines ofBank for International Settlement on Capital Adequacy Norms is being examined byan internal committee in RBI and at some stage interaction with market participantsFourth, perhaps the most important area, which I hope will be further discussed, is theissue of institutional structure for regulation. The institutional structure for financialregulations should be consistent with good corporate governance .  Because of therecent developments in financial sector, especially the issue of stability, almosteverywhere there is a review of institutional structure for regulation .  In somecountries like UK, action has been initiated on this front while in others, they mighthave not yet acted .  In India, it is time for us to be conscious of the need for reviewThere are broadly two approaches to regulation .  One is the institutional approach,and the other is functional approach .  The basis of the institutional approach is tocover institutions, irrespective of business, which is convenient from the prudential.  The functional approach prefers to control business activity irrespective of theinstitutions .  But, the reality is that there is an overlap and such overlap betweeninstitutions and business activities are getting to be complex .  In any case, there is nouniversally accepted model of regulation .  It is, therefore, essential to review andidentify a model that is relevant for current Indian conditions and is consistent withThere are five important issues regarding the institutional structure of financialregulation in India, which need to be addressed while undertaking a review. (a) Thereare regulatory gaps. (b) There are regulatory overlaps. There is a growing recognitionabout this issue from the point of view of developing market for securitised debt. (c)There is a perceived need for formal co-ordination between the regulatory agencies,which is currently occurring through an informal high level group on capital markets..future needs.angleand academics would be essential.regulatory bodies.Associationcirculated by the RBI recently.presided over by the Governor of the RBI with SEBI Chairman and Finance Secretaryas Members. (d) A variety of issues are coming up with regard to the issue ofGovernment nominees on the regulatory bodies and their role in regulation .  Ofcourse, in the Reserve Bank of India, the Government nominee is member of theBoard but is a non-voting member .  But, in other organisations like SEBI, where theremay be more than one nominee of Government, the question of regulatory-autonomyarises, more so if the Government is also the owner. (e) There are new developmentslike the establishment of insurance regulatory authority .  There can be regulatoryoverlaps, for example, if State Bank of India diversifies into insurance business orSince there is no point in creating new bureaucracies, there are practical difficulties inmassive redeployment of personnel, and expertise for regulation cannot be createdovernight, some ways of filling up the regulatory gaps and overlaps should be foundwithout disrupting the existing regulatory structures .  I would propose that it isnecessary to explore the feasibility of an umbrella regulatory legislation which createsan apex regulatory authority without disturbing the existing jurisdiction .  The featuresof the ideas are: The Board for Financial Supervision of the RBI can continue tosupervise banks and non-banks but with the Deputy Governor as Chairman; theinsurance regulating authority will supervise insurance companies and Securities andExchange Board of India will continue with its regulatory jurisdiction. The apexfinancial regulatory authority may be constituted, by statute with the Governor of theReserve Bank of India as Chairman and the members could be Chairmen of the threeregulatory agencies. The apex body should also include some outside experts on apart-time basis .  Finance Secretary could be a permanent special invitee or a regularmember without voting rights as in the case of the RBI Board .  The apex authoritycould have by law, jurisdiction to assign regulatory gaps to one of the agencies ;arbitrate on regulatory overlaps and ensure regulatory co-ordination. The apexauthority could be serviced by a part-time secretariat of the RBI .  In a way theproposal improves and formalises the present informal arrangement into a legislativebased authority. This idea could be debated as one of the options for regulatoryThere are a number of areas requiring attention, which are in the nature ofFirst, there is an impression that the whole debate on corporate governance inIndia is restricted to large corporates in India .  Are the middle level industries, associations and financial organisations in a position to at least benchmarkwhere they are? There is a need for some studies with regard to the nature ofSecond, during ‘sixties, ‘seventies and even in ‘eighties, the sensitivity of publicpolicy was to the concentration of the economic power but that view was abandoned.  But, a serious problem recently observed in Asiarelates to the intra-group allocation of resources, i.e., within the same group,particularly family groups .  Intra-group allocation of resources to the extent it is non-transparent and goes unmonitored, could make a travesty of genuine corporate.

The status of intra-group allocation of resources and mechanisms toThird, the role of foreign institutional investors ( FIIs) in corporate governancecannot be ignored .  Particularly, after the Asian crisis, the FIIs have been placing a lotof emphasis on corporate governance .  Both from corporates point of view, who wantto attract foreign investment and from the macro economic point of view where IndiaFourth, steps must be considered to meet international standards in manyaspects relevant to corporate governance .  There is an extraordinarily increasingemphasis on relevant standards as for example, on bankruptcy laws which are soughtto be made consistent with some principles in all countries .  It is not possible for anycountry to be one hundred per cent in conformity with the international standards butthe deviation should be explicable and that is another area where attention is required.According to the latest BIS report, the regulators in industrialised countries (say, theUK) may have to satisfy themselves that the regulatory frame in emerging economies(say, India) is of international standards to permit entities (say, State Bank of India) toFifth, globalisation is not a one way process, and hence, Indian corporateshave to operate increasingly in other countries to raise resources, or establish jointventures etc. It would imply that our corporates, especially larger ones, should meetSixth, yet another area which has not yet come to the fore but it should comeup more openly soon, relates to credit rating agencies .  The perception of fallibilityand non-accountability of credit rating agencies is growing. Often, corporatedecisions, including investments by financial intermediaries are taken solely on thebasis of credit rating of select agencies .  The question of some sort of regulation orthemselves, is now being debated.Seventh, the credibility of professional organisations like the chartered accountantsshould be of high order, both with respect to the adequacy and integrity of disclosuresThe irregularities that have occurred in the financial sector a few years ago haveraised questions about the possibility of inadequacies, if not connivance .  ProfessionalEighth, with regard to company secretaries also, the question of quality arisesIn the context of corporate governance, company secretaries could carve out a specialand unique role for themselves .  Another issue is, whether introduction ofrepresentation for company secretaries on par with chartered accountants in Boards ofpublic sector banks and financial institutions will give a wider net of professionals.Ninth, it will also be useful to scan the research methodology on the subject of.

It would be inappropriate to do so and itTo conclude, regulators are external pressure points for good corporate.  There seems be a feeling that mere compliance with regulatoryrequirements is an ideal situation .  In fact, mere compliance with regulatory pressuresis a minimal requirement of good corporate governance, and what are required areinternal pressures, peer pressures and market pressures to reach standards for higherthan minima prescribed by regulatory agencies .
