1Foreign Exchange Reserves: New Realities and OptionsDistinguished Friends,I am thankful to the organisers for inviting me to participate in the 2006Program of Seminars on the Theme "The World in Asia, Asia in the World". Thetheme for this session has tantalising words: problems, plenty, challenges,opportunities, accumulation, large, foreign, windfall and reserves. It may be a littlehard to match the sense of these words in an address by central bankers. So, Iintend taking a slightly broader view of the subject and focus on the new realities andinnovative ideas. I would argue that there are degrees of comfort at various levels ofreserves at any given time and in a country-context and in general, higher thedegree of comfort, more numerous are the options.I.  New Realities of Forex Reserves and Management(i) Large Increase: Most Rapid in AsiaIn the aftermath of the Asian crises, it was widely perceived, supported byacademic research and commentators, that large reserves were needed byemerging market economies (EMEs) to withstand any crisis and, to some extent, itwas a reflection of the lack of confidence in the international financial architecture.As a result, the recent episode of reserve accumulation has been on a much higherscale and more prolonged than was seen during the early 1990s. For instance, asreported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the EMEs, during 2000 and2005,  accumulated reserves at an annual rate of US $ 250 billion (or 3.5 per cent oftheir annual combined GDP), which was almost five times higher than the level seenin the early 1990s. The bulk of the reserve accumulation was concentrated in Asiawith countries like China, Korea, India, Malaysia and Taiwan (China) witnessinglarge increases, while countries in Latin America and Central Europe had a fairlymodest increase in reserves during this period. Lately, many oil-exporting countrieshave also seen a large increase in their reserves.It may be useful to recognise that reserve accumulation, in some senses,reflects the savings-investment balances and is symptomatic of both domestic and                                                          1 Address by  Dr. Y.V.Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 2006 Program of Seminars inSingapore during September 16 to 18, 2006 on the Theme "The World in Asia, Asia in the World".This address was in the session entitled "Problems of Plenty? Challenges and Opportunities from theAccumulation of Large Foreign Exchange Reserves and Windfall Revenue" on September 18, 2006.2global factors, including self-insurance, a concept difficult to define.(ii) Reserves Increases: Mostly Driven by Capital Account SurplusIt is important to identify the sources of reserve accretion in this latestepisode. There are some countries like Russia where the reserves are built out ofcurrent account surplus. In countries like China, Korea and Taiwan, the surplus, inboth current and capital account, led to accumulation of reserves.  On the otherhand, there are countries like India, where the reserves accretion was driven moreby capital account surplus and not due to current account surplus, broadly implyingthat capital inflow was more than what could be normally absorbed in the domesticeconomy. Net capital flows have remained much larger than the current accountdeficit in India as well as in most of Latin America and Central & Eastern Europe. Incase the reserve accumulation is due to large capital flows, it may be useful todistinguish between debt and non-debt flows as also between foreign directinvestment and generally less stable portfolio flows. In fact, the stock as well as flowin each category would be relevant for reserve management. While the marking-to-market of the assets and liabilities may be difficult, it might not be irrelevant.Thus, while the traditional indicators of adequacy of reserves are based ontrade, debt and monetary indicators, or even the ‘Guidotti Rule’ or ‘Liquidity at Risk’Rule suggested by Alan Greenspan may help explain the adequacy of reserves, theyneed to be supplemented with, what may be described as, multiple indicators toassess the adequacy of reserves of any country at a given juncture.(iii) Difficulties in Computing Quasi Fiscal Cost of ReservesA simple method of calculating net cost of carrying reserves to the centralbank is the difference between the interest rate on domestic securities and the rateof return earned on the foreign exchange reserves adjusted for any exchange ratechange. The magnitude of the cost, which is often difficult to estimate, varies with theextent of sterilisation and the yield differentials. These are termed “quasi-fiscal” costsin the literature since the costs to the central bank are passed on to the sovereignthrough a lower transfer of profits. In countries where local interest rates are wellabove international levels, such carrying costs could be positive, while if the reverseis true such carrying costs could be negative. A recent study by the BIS has shownthat carrying costs are negative in a number of countries at current interest rates.3The study states that in China, for instance, the one year interest rate in June 2006was less than half the comparable US Treasury bond rate. Hence the central bank isearning a positive carry. However, it can be argued that given the inherent cyclicalnature of interest rates, such negative carrying cost could reverse over a period oftime. Moreover, one has to keep in mind that these hypothetical cost calculations donot capture capital gains or losses.  Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has proposeda measure of social cost of reserves, from the national stand point, that is equal tothe spread between the private sector's cost of short-term borrowing abroad and theyield that the central bank earns on its liquid foreign assets. He estimates this costroughly equivalent to one per cent of GDP of the developing countries in 2004.Briefly stated, there are difficulties in calculating precisely quasi-fiscal costs or othercosts on this account.While assessing the fiscal cost of holding reserves, it would be worthwhile toset off the benefits that the country may have in holding reserves. In any country riskanalysis by the rating agencies and other institutions, the level of reserves generallyhas high weights. Moreover, it is essential to keep in view some hidden benefitswhich could accrue to a country holding reserves, which may, inter alia, include:maintaining confidence in monetary and exchange rate policies; enhancing thecapacity to intervene in foreign exchange markets; limiting external vulnerability soas to absorb shocks during times of crisis; providing confidence to the markets thatexternal obligations can always be met; and reducing volatility in foreign exchangemarkets. It is true that beyond a point, when the credit rating reaches appropriateinvestment grade,  addition to reserves may not lead to further improvement in thecredit  rating. It is necessary to recognise that, as in the case of costs, there aredifficulties in computing the benefits too.(iv) Changing Composition of ReservesThe available data on the composition of official reserves indicate thatprogress towards diversification of reserves has been cautious, which is notsurprising given the very definition of reserves in terms of “external assets that arereadily available…..…” as defined by the IMF. An important objective of holding thereserves is to be prepared for contingencies, but the range of instruments availableto satisfy this need is limited. Nevertheless, the management of reserves has beenchanging and there has been a quest for higher returns within these traditional4objectives. To quote Mr. Philip D. Wooldridge of the BIS, in his latest article on “TheChanging Composition of Official Reserves” in the September 2006 issue of the BISQuarterly Review:“Continuing a trend that began in the 1970s, when reserves were firstreallocated from US Treasury bills to bank deposits, reserve managers havebeen gradually shifting into higher-yielding, higher-risk instruments. Theyseem most comfortable managing market risk but are beginning to take onmore credit and liquidity risk too. The currency composition of their portfolios,while volatile, has not changed as much as the instrument composition."It is essential to recognise that reserve managers are already shifting intohigher-yielding instruments with a higher risk-return equation, presumably as a resultof progressively rising level of reserves. Consequently, the financial returns on thefree reserves at the margin could be far higher than the average return.  In my view,the marginal return appears to be a more relevant concept in the context ofalternative forms of investment of reserves.(v) Quasi ReservesWith the positive shock emanating from large capital flows resulting insignificant reserves accumulation in many EMEs, a new development in reservemanagement is to hold a part of the reserves which could be used by the publicsector in a country in a manner different from the strictly defined pattern of holding ofthe external assets by the monetary authorities. Such foreign exchange reservescould be termed as quasi reserves. In terms of its holding, such quasi reserves couldbe easily retrievable when the situation demands. In Singapore, the MonetaryAuthority of Singapore (MAS) and the Government of Singapore InvestmentCorporation (GIC) basically manage foreign exchange reserves. GIC is theGovernment’s principal investment agent, handling the bulk of the nation’sinvestments while the MAS holds reserves to maintain the stability of the Singaporedollar. Similarly, Temasek Holdings invests in Singapore as well as managesdiversified global portfolio with the aim of creating and maximising sustainable valuefor the shareholders and providing resources to finance pension and other benefits.On the pattern of the Singapore's GIC, South Korea has recently establishedthe Korean Investment Corporation (KIC). Another interesting example is China,where foreign exchange reserves have been utilised to strengthen the bankingsystem without foreign securities being sold. China has transferred funds from its5international reserves, held with the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC) to a newcompany, Central Huijin Investment Company (CHIC), set up in 2003 and jointlymanaged by the government, PBC and the State Administration of ForeignExchange. In the PBC's balance sheet, the said amount of reserves was replaced byclaims on the CHIC. The CHIC used the assets to purchase shares in banks whichwere to be recapitalised.(vi) Stabilisation FundsInvestment funds are sometimes created by the public sector out of "windfallrevenue" accruing to a country due to rise in export price of, say, oil or othercommodities. Such reserves arise due to positive external shocks which can cause asurge in government revenues and, at times, could be challenging as someGovernments may have to deal with an appreciating exchange rate, underminingexport competitiveness with symptoms of "dutch disease". Many countries such asChile, Kuwait, Norway, Russia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) haveinstitutionalised the investment of the surplus arising from the positive shocks ofcommodity and oil prices by creating sophisticated investment agencies orcommodity/oil stabilisation funds to manage reserves – since there is a broaderrange of investment opportunities for their savings today than in the 1970s or 1980s.The management of such corpus may, in some cases, be entrusted to the centralbank but with an appropriate mandate.Usually, these stabilisation funds are established with one or more of thefollowing objectives: insulate the budget and the economy from excess volatility inrevenues; help monetary authorities to sterilise unwanted liquidity; build up savingsfor future generations; or use the money for economic and social development. Inregard to oil funds, the transparency and disclosures standards appear to be lowerthan those for the official reserves but with some accountability.An interesting question in this regard is the extent to which the windfallrevenues can be equated with the large capital flows. While there could be adeceleration in the windfall revenues, the reserve accumulation due to large capitalflows should reckon with the possibility of potential reversals and outflows in respectof the capital account.II.  Innovative Ideas6It is useful to explore some of the innovative ideas that have been put forwardin the recent period for using reserves.First, in March 2006, Prof. Lawrence Summers while delivering the L. K. JhaMemorial Lecture in Mumbai, argued that the level of reserves in many countries farexceeded the traditional measures of reserve levels required to guard against aforeign exchange crisis. While expressing concern about the risk composition of theassets in which these reserves are invested, Prof. Summers suggested that it wastime for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to think abouthow they could contribute to deployment of the reserves held by some of the majoremerging markets. Prof. Summers suggested creation of an international facility bythese two multilateral institutions, under which the countries could invest their excessreserves without taking domestic political responsibility for the process of investmentdecision and ultimate outcome. In turn, the modest fee charged by these twoinstitutions could support the concessional and grant aspects of global development.The proposal provides an option to a country holding reserves to place a partof them with the IMF/World Bank entities to operate, de facto, as external assetmanagers. The option could be exercised, presuming that it would be permissible,but not obligatory, to make placement of a part of the reserves if the envisaged entitycould assure that it had the expertise to function as such an external asset managerand to provide a higher risk-weighted return than the domestic reserve managers.Further, since the external asset managers for reserve management in the marketare usually guided by the parameters fixed by the official reserve managementauthorities, which may vary from country to country, the proposed entity may alsohave to have several windows to cater to the varied mixes of safety, liquidity andreturn preferred by various client countries. Thus, the critical issue would be theprofessional expertise of the proposed entity in terms of assuring  an acceptable risk-reward equation.Second, there was a proposal in 2005 by Eswar Prasad and Raghuram Rajanof the IMF for a controlled approach to capital account liberalisation for economiesexperiencing large capital inflows. The proposal essentially involves securitising aportion of capital inflows through closed-ended mutual funds that issue shares in thedomestic currency, use the proceeds to purchase foreign exchange from the centralbank and then invest the foreign exchange so acquired, abroad. It is argued thatsuch an arrangement would eliminate the fiscal costs of sterilising these inflows,7provide the domestic investors opportunities for international portfolio diversificationand stimulate the development of domestic financial markets; more importantly, itwould allow central banks to control both, the timing and the quantity of capitaloutflows. It is advocated that this proposal could be a part of a broader toolkit ofmeasures to liberalise the capital account cautiously when external circumstancesare favourable.The merit of this proposal is in combining three elements – capital accountmanagement, financial sector development and use of foreign exchangereserves.This proposal, for setting up more than closed-ended private-sector foreign-asset funds, to be licensed by the central bank, appears relevant under certaincircumstances, mainly when there is a likelihood of a significant investor interest forsuch fund. This, however, does not seem realisable, if there is a negative carry thatsuch funds could entail. Further, it is not certain whether a private intermediarylicensed by a central bank specifically for this purpose would entirely obviate themoral hazard, even in the absence of any explicit or implicit guarantee with regard toperformance. In India, domestic mutual funds are permitted to invest in foreign securities,apart from ADR/GDR of Indian companies, up to an aggregate limit of USD twobillion. In addition, a limited number of qualified mutual funds are also permitted toinvest cumulatively up to USD one billion in overseas exchange traded funds (ETF).More generally, the pace and sequencing of several measures of liberalisation ofcapital account take into account the degree of comfort as one of the relevantfactors.Third, an idea which received some attention in March 2002 during thegathering on ‘Finance for Development’ in Monterrey, Mexico, is that instead ofholding the reserves in the US dollars, a new form of global money, akin to IMF'sSpecial Drawing Rights, namely, ‘global greenbacks’ could be issued, whichcountries could hold in their reserves. The corpus would be created by countriessetting aside a part of reserves every year as an insurance against contingencies.The amount of money held by these countries in ‘global greenbacks’ could be givento developing countries for financing their development programmes as well asglobal public goods like environmental projects, health initiatives, humanitarianassistance, and so on. For countries that receive less than the amount that theyneed to put into reserves, the new ‘global money’ would go into reserves freeing8dollars that these countries would otherwise set aside. Countries that receive morethan they must put into reserves, could exchange the new money for conventionalcurrencies.  Eventually, all the new money will find its way into reserves, which ineffect represent a commitment by the countries to help each other in times of trouble. It has been argued that the global greenbacks proposal envisages flow offunds to poor countries according to their need while contributing to global economicgrowth, stability and equity. Opponents of this move have argued that somecountries will become “greenback addicts”, and when the handouts end, theeconomic withdrawal symptoms will be severe.Fourth, in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, two related developmentstook place. In the year 2000, ASEAN+3 countries mutually agreed to form a networkof bilateral swap agreements to provide mutual protection from financialemergencies, popularly known as the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI). The success ofsuch an initiative is reflected in the recent proposal of the Asian Finance Ministers todouble the size of the Asian Central Bank Swaps under the CMI.The Asian Bond Fund Initiative was also launched in 2003 reflecting theefforts to develop a regional bond market for catering to the medium- and long-termfinancing needs of the Asian economies. The Asian Bond Fund provided anarrangement for pooling of a portion of foreign exchange reserves of a few East Asiaand Pacific countries and the Fund’s portfolio is invested in the liquid US dollardenominated bonds issued by the major Asian economies. The second ABF,launched in June 2005, aims to promote local currency bond markets, byestablishing a Pan-Asian Bond Index Fund (PAIF) and eight single-market funds(SMFs).III.  Degree of ComfortThe concept of adequacy of reserves is popular but it is also possible, from apractitioner's perspective, to view reserves in terms of degree of comfort they provideat various levels. Such a perspective is more dynamic and contextual. Certainly, at avery low level of reserves, which we in India had in the early 1990s, the degree ofcomfort was very low, and with rising level of reserves, the comfort also increases.The level of comfort and discomfort could be linked to the problem of plenty and theproblem of paucity – with a continuum representing different levels of comfort atvarious levels of reserves. For a country, it could happen that initially the degree of9comfort with the level of reserves may be too low for sometime but with rising level ofreserves, the country might reach a 'comfort zone', and as the reserves level keepson rising to reach a still higher level, then at some point,  a portion of the reserveswould cease to be strictly ‘foreign exchange reserves’ and could be characterised asa corpus of funds available for deployment in a  higher risk-return portfolio.Several factors, apart from the exchange rate regime, influence the comfortlevel in regard to reserves. Illustratively, they would include vulnerability to the realsector shocks, strength of the fiscal and financial sectors, current account balance,the changing composition of capital flows, a medium-term view of growth prospectsencompassing business cycles, etc. In a sense, official reserves have to reflect thebalancing and comforting factors relative to external assets and liabilities in thecontext of a rational balance sheet approach.IV. Options linked to ComfortLet me now link the availability of options with the degree of comfort.First, it may be useful, for practical purposes, to view the adequacy ofreserves in terms of degree of comfort they offer at a given time.Second, while considering the level of reserves and comfort derived therefrom, it will be necessary to take into account the investment and the stabilisationfunds, if applicable. Further, transferability from official reserves to such funds andvice versa, and the extent of liquidity required, also need to be considered inassessing the comfort level.Third, relative emphasis on safety, liquidity and return keeps changing withthe degree of comfort at a given level of reserves.Fourth, it must be noted that from a national balance sheet point of view,official reserves have to reflect the potential market infirmities in the private sector.So, if there are high returns derived from high risks assumed due to larger riskappetite of the external asset managers, then deploying official reserves too in thehigh-risk assets would exacerbate the risks. Official reserves may be needed as acushion when markets get suddenly risk averse and hence, safety and liquidityshould normally have higher orders of priority in the management of reserves.10Fifth, it is possible for a central bank to have tranches – each tranchereflecting a different combination of safety, liquidity and return. Each tranche can bemanaged by the central bank or an external asset manager, or both, in parallel, tobenchmark their relative performance.Finally, and above all, the criticality of the accountability in the use of reservesmust be recognised. It is useful to note that the reserve management policiesnormally involve joint responsibility of the Government and the central bank –irrespective of in whose balance sheet they appear.V. Concluding ObservationsI would like to recall here what I had said in this regard In 2003, at the AnnualFund-Bank Meetings in Dubai:"The reserve accumulation could also be seen in the context of the availabilityof abundant international liquidity following the easing of the monetary policyin industrial countries.  The resultant excess liquidity flowed into the emergingmarkets.  In the event of hardening of interest rates in industrialised countries,this liquidity may as quickly dry up; in that situation, emerging markets shouldhave sufficient cushion to withstand such reverse flows of capital."Now, with the global rise in the interest rates, there is always a lurking fear inthe EMEs, that the level of capital flows may not be maintained. Thus, the comfortlevel of reserves should not be viewed with respect to the current situation alone butshould also reckon the assessment of the emerging risks. Moreover, at this moment,the global economy has not been tested on the eventuality of a not-so-orderlycorrection of the current global imbalances. In that eventuality, as the expertscaution, disruption in financial markets in the form of large cross-currency volatilityand sharp rise in interest rates are not unlikely in the global economy.To sum up, several factors impinge on the comfort level of reserves and therelative weights assigned to safety, liquidity and return. When, how and throughwhom should the search for higher returns be pursued, depending upon the level ofcomfort, is a matter of convenience and context, and options, as appropriate, shouldalways be kept open.Thank you.11
