    POLICY LESSONS FROM THE  GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS    by  Mr.  V.K. Sharma  Executive Director  Reserve Bank of India        Shri Mukul Somany, Chairman, Confederation of Indian Industrty  (Eastern Region), Shri S.S. Kohli, Chairman & Managing Director,  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited, Shri S.C. Gupta,  Chairman & Managing Director, United Bank of India, Shri  Ambarish Dasgupta, Executive Director, PwC, Shri R.K. Agrawal,  Chairman, Economic Affairs, Finance & Taxation Subcommittee,  CII (ER) and distinguished guests and invitees, members of the  electronic and print media and ladies and gentlemen.     1. First of all, I would wish to thank Shri Mukul Somany,  Chairman, CII, Eastern Region, for giving me the opportunity and  privilege to address this distinguished and august audience.   Second, I must congratulate and compliment the CII on very  imaginatively selecting Better Banking for Economic  Development as the theme for the Banking Colloquium.  I am also  very impressed by the fact that the Colloquium is very well  conceived  and  structured  what  with all  the material and relevant   1 Address delivered by Mr. V.K. Sharma, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, at the  Banking Colloquium organized by Confederation of Indian Industry (Eastern Region) at  Kolkata on September 4, 2009.     1  topics germane to the subject-matter having been included with  just the right focus and emphasis.   Also, I could not agree more  with Shri Mukul Somany when he says that safe, sound, secure,  robust and resilient banking and financial system is a sine qua  non for sustainable, and inclusive, economic growth and  prosperity and that is precisely why both financial stability and  price stability have informed policy making in the Reserve Bank of  India.    2.  The recent financial crisis has thrown into sharp relief, as  never before, the critical and important role of 'asset price'  inflation/asset bubbles also, as opposed to that of shop  floor/products/services inflation alone, as a key variable, in  monetary policy response. For what happened was  unprecedented in that with monetary policy focused only on  traditional CPI, interest rates were kept low in spite of exploding  prices of assets like real estate/property, credit assets, equity and  commodities.  And this was all made possible because of the huge  current account surpluses in China and other EMEs, and huge  private capital inflows into EMEs in excess of their current account  deficit, getting recycled back as official capital flows into  government bonds of reserve currency countries, especially the  USA, resulting in compression of long term yields which, in turn,  translated into lower long term interest rates even for the riskier  asset classes mentioned above.  This chasing of yield, due to  global savings glut, in turn, led to a veritable credit bubble,  characterized by unprecedented underpricing of risk as reflected in   2the all-time-low risk premia with junk bond spreads becoming  indistinguishable from investment grade debt !  Such a low interest  rate environment coupled with luxuriant supply of liquidity, created  enabling environment for excessive leverage and risk taking so  much so that American household debt exceeded the country's  GDP!  In fact, in the US, in particular, the financial sector, instead  of being a means to an end of sub-serving the real sector, ended  up being an end in itself.  Interestingly, in this context, Satyajit  Das, a world renowned expert in derivatives, in his characteristic  breezy and racy style, describes the financial syndrome as " 'too  much' and 'too little'  too much liquidity, too much leverage, too  much complex financial engineering, too little return for risk, too  little understanding of the risks".  This syndrome of too much of  arcane rocket science and financial alchemy in the financial sector,  almost entirely for its own sake to almost complete exclusion of the  needs of the real sector,  created a massive financial sector  real  sector imbalance which, being, intrinsically unsustainable,  culminated eventually into the now-all-too-familiar apocalyptic  denouement, entailing cumulative global writedowns and credit  losses aggregating US $ 1.6 trillion the estimate of which, IMF has  since revised to US$ 4.5 trillion ! This, in turn, led to a sort of the  so called 'Ponzi finance culture' where, with personal savings rate  at close to zero, consumption spending binge was driven through  withdrawal of home equity made possible by omni-present home  equity loans rather than through incomes ! Thus, the entire debt  binge was spent in consumption and not investment, leading to a  veritable partial deindustrialization of America, as it were, with the  possible exception of the services sector.  All this while, the US   3growth story stayed non inflationary due primarily to cheap imports  from China, Asia and EMEs.    3. These large and persistent imbalances represented  unearned prosperity for deficit reserve currency countries and  unshared prosperity for surplus countries. Such a global  economic order was inherently unsustainable and unstable from  the word go.  In other words, the only sustainable and durable  global economic growth model would be where growth and  prosperity are both earned and shared. And mind you,  `unearned` and `un-shared` prosperity are no socialistic/  egalitarian platitudinal  rhetoric but pretty compelling real-politik  and geo-economic imperatives given the current irreversibly  globalised and integrated world.  In fact, the whole thing can be  likened to cosmic balance/equilibrium/harmony where stars, suns,  planets, all orbit within the inviolable discipline of their elliptical  orbits which do not permit deviant behaviour beyond the shortest  and the longest distance from the suns and stars of the orbiting  planets!  Any deviant behaviour/conduct, inconsistent with the  cosmic harmonious balance and equilibrium, will invite and inflict  extremely retributive backlash; the more severe and prolonged the  disequilibrium and imbalance, the more wrenching and  excruciating will be the resulting pain as is currently being  experienced.  But the sobering chastising that the world has  experienced in the current financial crisis, should stand us in good  stead going forward provided all the lessons have been  unforgettably learnt, imbibed, assimilated and completely  internalized !   44. In refreshing contrast, India ran modest current account  surpluses to modest current account deficits with only the latest  current account deficit at 2.6 % of GDP due to the impact of the  ongoing global recession.  Thus, in the post-economic reforms  period, through its macro economic policies, India demonstrated  that it is committed to, and believes in, earned and shared  prosperity in our economic relations with the rest of the world  through sustainable and balanced current account.   5. The current global economic recession, the worst since the  Great Depression, was caused by the apocalyptic global financial  melt down and not the other way round which traditionally has so  far been the case, where typically it was economic recession that  preceded and precipitated financial crises. At the risk of being  repetitive, it must be noted that even if global imbalances and  accommodative monetary policy provided an enabling  environment for excessive leverage and risk taking, it was still the  responsibility of regulators and supervisors to have taken  appropriate macro-prudential measures, pre-emptively and  proactively, rather than reactively. But unfortunately broad  spectrum and generic regulatory and supervisory failure  worldwide, especially in the West, precipitated the current  unprecedented global financial crisis.  This regulatory and  supervisory inertia to unprecedented build up of risk globally,  typical, and characteristic, of the hunky-dory and gung ho financial  environment of the pre-crisis days, is most graphically epitomized  by what Mark Twain said 100 years ago: "It ain't what you don't  know that gets you into trouble; it is what you know for sure that   5just ain't so!" In refreshing contrast, in India, we have had  remarkable financial stability, not fortuitously, but thanks to pre- emptively and pro-actively delivered prudential measures like  increase in risk weights for exposures to commercial real estate,  capital market, venture capital funds and systemically important  non-deposit accepting Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs).   These pre-crisis prudential regulatory measures of Reserve Bank  of India represented what now are famously known as  countercyclical capital measures  and have been strongly  commended for adoption by various recent  Working Groups /  Committees of international regulators. Indeed, in the aftermath of  the global financial crisis and resulting economic recession, these  countercyclical capital measures have been rolled back to cushion  the adverse collateral impact of the crisis to considerable  beneficial effect to the Indian economy complemented, of course,  by duly calibrated monetary policy easing which was earlier  preemptively tightened to contain inflationary expectations.  6. The global credit crisis has also thrown into sharp relief a  'strong connect' between 'liquidity risk' and 'opaque off-balance  sheet exposures' of whatever description.  The appropriate  supervisory and regulatory response to these risks would,  therefore, be to insist on full disclosure and transparency of off- balance sheet commitments/ exposures and supervisory  insistence on an appropriate mix of 'stored' and 'purchased'  liquidity and appropriate capital charge for liquidity risk; the higher  the 'purchased liquidity' component, the higher the capital charge  and the higher the 'stored liquidity' component, the lower the   6capital charge.  Thus, banking supervisors and regulators need to  be more hands-on and pro-active in focusing supervisory attention  on this critical risk category than has been the case so far.  (In  fact, in India the Committee on Financial Sector Assessment  (CFSA), Chaired by Dr.Rakesh Mohan and Co-chaired by Shri  Ashok Chawla, Union Finance Secretary, almost presciently  focused on this critical risk in the month of May itself, much before  the liquidity and credit crunch of August 2007).    7. As is invariably the case with any major crisis, the ongoing  global financial crisis has unleashed a passionate debate over the  design of a new global financial architecture.  The opinion on  overarching role in global financial surveillance is sharply divided  between assigning it to Financial Stability Forum, since  rechristened as Financial Stability Board, on the one hand, and to  IMF, on the other.  However, the trouble has been not so much  with the existing, inter-temporally evolved, global financial  architecture as really with how it was actually worked in practice.   Recent huge losses at global banks running to about USD 1.6  trillion are not because existing best practices failed but because  those responsible for implementing and enforcing them failed   them !  After all, of all risks to regulators and regulatees alike,  human resources risk is by far the most serious as it is the source  of all risks as confirmed by the ongoing financial cataclysm.  The  crux of the matter is what we need is not more, or less, regulation  and governance but good regulation and governance.  This has  been the undoing of both regulators/supervisors and financial  firms/banks alike.   In the way of example, in the USA, the   7traditionally very healthy AAA rated mono-line bond insurers MBIA  and Ambac changed their business model from insuring only their  staple municipal bonds to insuring CDOs and ABS.  While this  went unnoticed by insurance regulators, Pershing Square, a  hedge fund, spotted trouble and started shorting both equity and  credit risk of these two companies.  But even after this, regulators  failed to take notice and corrective action with the two companies  being eventually downgraded several notches.  The same is true  of financial firms and banks where independent directors on the  boards, much less ask right questions, apparently didn't even  understand the arcane world of modern finance and banking and  according to a column in the Financial Times, after the crisis, one  leading global bank ran an advertisement inviting applications for  board positions from experienced professional bankers !  Besides,  rather than take timely notice of, and act on, early warning signals  coming from financial markets, like stock and CDSs markets,  regulators chose instead to shut themselves to these early  warning signals themselves by banning short selling which act  effectively amounted to shooting the messenger for the  unpalatable message it had to convey !    8. However, for all the positives about the Indian economy, the  fact still remains that in view of the growing integration of the  Indian economy and the financial system with the rest of the world,  it cannot be the case that Indian economy should have remained  unaffected. The Indian economy was collaterally affected primarily  through two channels: the Capital account and the Trade account.  While India continued to experience substantial net capital inflows,   8the situation changed for the worse in September / October 2008  in the wake of Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, with substantial net  capital outflows and this, in combination with widening trade  account and current account deficits resulted in the decline of  foreign exchange reserves of about USD 60 billion, from USD 316  billion in May 2008 to about USD 255 billion now. The trade deficit  widened to USD 120 billion (10 % of GDP) and current account  deficit widened to USD 29 billion (2.6 % of GDP).   9. Because of the integration with the rest of the world, fall in  export demand for Indian merchandise and services, the GDP  grew by 6.7 % in 2008-09 compared with an average growth of 9%  plus in the previous 3 years. Thus, it will be seen that the Indian  economy was much less adversely affected, primarily due to being  driven by domestic demand which again had a very strong rural  demand component. Significantly, even now the rural demand  continues to remain robust, especially for autos, two wheelers,  tractors and FMCGs.  This was all made possible because of  public spending under National Rural Employment Guarantee  Programme, Rural Self-Employment Programme and Rural Road  Construction Programme under flagship Government sponsored  schemes. Indeed, as a critical complement to this effort, financial  inclusion initiative driven by leveraging smart card and bio-metric  technology, also played a pivotal role. Besides, going forward, with  400 million odd mobile phone subscribers in India, mobile banking  has tremendous potential for spreading banking and financial  services to rural and semi-urban areas and further economic  empowerment of the financially excluded.            910. Inevitably, the fiscal policy had to respond commensurately  and Government delivered three fiscal stimulus packages, as a  result of which the fiscal deficit rose from 2.7 % of GDP in 2007-08  to 6.2 % of GDP in 2008-09 and is projected to rise to 6.8 % in  2009-10. But, this is not a cause for concern primarily because we  need to look at fiscal deficit not in isolation but in conjunction with  current account deficit. Thus, even though the fiscal deficit is 6.2  %, the current account deficit at 2.6 % is below 3 %, a level which  is considered sustainable. The underlying idea is that current  account deficit subsumes fiscal deficit in the sense that high fiscal  deficit essentially connotes high public sector dis-saving  which  can be offset by private sector and house hold sector savings. It is  significant in this context to note that Indian economy has been  characterized by increasing domestic savings rate financing  investment, with domestic savings rate reaching a high of about 38  % of GDP in financing investment of 39% of GDP in 2007-08.        11. Both the Government and the Reserve Bank of India  responded to the challenge in close coordination and consultation.  The main plank of the government response was fiscal stimulus  while the Reserve Bank's action comprised well-calibrated timely  monetary accommodation and counter-cyclical regulatory  measures.  But, not without reasons, concerns have been voiced  and, legitimately so, whether going forward the externalities of the  global financial crisis will lead to going slow on the financial sector  reforms agenda in India.  These concerns essentially owe  themselves to the ongoing debate in the West where it is  apprehended that the pendulum may swing from lax and liberal   10regulation to policy backlash and regulatory over-kill.   But I may  assure that we in India have no reason to be defensive about our  commitment to, and pursuit of, the financial sector reforms agenda  for the simple reason that crisis, or no crisis, we have, in India,  been able to deliver credible and effective regulation and  supervision of the financial system.  Besides, it is noteworthy that  there is just no conflict between financial sector reforms and  regulation and supervision; rather there is confluence between the  two as effective and credible regulation and supervision is the  ultimate guarantee of sustainable financial sector reforms.  The  fact remains that the Indian banking and financial sector is very  well regulated and well-capitalized and has demonstrably proved  resilient to the recent global financial tsunami as reflected in the  following key parameters: Total Assets: USD 1 trillion, CRAR:  13.18 %, ROA: 1.03%; Gross NPA: 2.41%, Net NPA: 1.12 %, NIM:  2.44 %, Liquid Assets to Total Assets: 33 %.  Indeed, as the  Committee on Financial Sector Assessment (CFSA) has pointed  out, Indian banking sector has scored very high on another critical  parameter of duration of equity in as much as this parameter  declined from the high of 14 years in March 2006 to 12 years in  2007 to 8 years in 2008 and 2009.  In other words, the interest  rate risk inherent in the banking system as a whole got nearly  halved.  However, again according to the Report of CFSA, there  has been an increasing reliance of the banking system on  `purchased`,  as opposed to `stored`,  liquidity.  Although this may  have since improved but needs to improve further going forward.     1112.  Last but not the least, I would like to take the present  opportunity to give sage advice to business and industry as  regards prudent use of derivatives.  As this distinguished and  august audience is well aware, there have reportedly been  massive derivatives-related losses incurred by business and  industry in India.  These losses arose primarily because  derivatives were used by business and industry not for hedging  but for speculative purposes.  The touch-stone that business and  industry can use with profit is that any derivatives strategy which  promises reduction, or elimination,  of hedging cost,  or promises  enhancing  income, is intrinsically speculative and the one that  involves incurring hedging cost and promises no income  enhancing is intrinsically a hedging strategy.  As reported in the  media, huge losses were sustained by business and industry on  account of complex structured and synthetic, but so much less  transparent, derivatives.  In other words, business and industry  must go in for plain vanilla derivatives which upfront transparently,  and explicitly, disclose cost of hedging strategy rather than  complex synthetic and structured derivatives which camouflage  risk.  13.  With these words I conclude my address and wish the  Colloquium all success that it deserves and also wish each one of  us `better banking` for sustainable and inclusive, economic growth,  development and prosperity !  Thank you all so very much.  ---:O:---     12
