That was built around the then emerging scenario of Indian financial system being exposed to competition and several  reform international best practices.  Since then, the market players have been moving towards adopting sound practices like risk management systems, enhanced transparency, disclosures and accounting standards, good corporate governance, etc. which are aimed at promoting financial Broadly speaking, promoting financial stability is the task of limiting the effects of financial disturbances on the economy. This has gained considerable prominence in the recent past as a policy objective of central banks and supervisory agencies, primarily reflecting the concerns Amongst financial crisis, banking crises are the most difficult to predict and have more lasting and damaging effects on the economy than those in other financial sector groupings. The recapitalisation costs associated with such crises in the recent past have been very high and it is estimated that on account of the Asian crises, some of the affected countries could have cost for banking crisis, there is an increased focus on banks and banking supervision in recent I may add that India could avoid the crisis mostly due to a cautious approach towards short-term external borrowings and capital account convertibility, and insignificant exposure to sensitive sectors like real estate and equity capital market.

Keeping in view this objective, the Committee on Financial System Narasimham Committee I) was set up. The Committee made a number of recommendations aimed at improving productivity, efficiency and profitability of the banking system on the one on the other. The Report was conceived as a holistic exercise and its recommendations were Progressive reduction of reserve requirements to correct the impact of directed investments on the profitability of banks, deregulation of complex and administered interest rate structure to move to market determined rates and introduction of prudential norms for asset classification, income recognition and provisioning in order to remove subjectivity were some of the major steps taken in the direction of banking sector reforms.

These called for a critical evaluation of policy initiatives already undertaken.

However, the methods used to determine the capital charge for credit risk in the Accord were not sufficiently framework for capital adequacy. Towards this end, the Basel Committee released a consultative paper on New Capital Adequacy Framework in June 1999 for comments by market players.

Timeframe for doubtful assets would be reduced to 18 months from 24 months by As Governor Bimal Jalan observed recently, It is no longer possible for developing countries to delay the introduction of strong prudential and supervisory norms, and We need to further tighten the prudential norms by increasing provisioning requirements on time-frame for migration to doubtful losses to 12 RBI had issued a number of instructions to the banks to tackle the problem of recovery of bad debts. While pursuing the compromise settlements arrived at Lok Adalats more effectively, the banks were also advised to constitute Settlement Advisory Committees ( SACs) for compromise settlements of chronic cases of NPAs under small sector. With a view to have a more realistic approach to reduce the stock of NPAs in all categories , revised guidelines were issued in July 2000 which provide a simplified, non-discretionary and non-discriminatory mechanism for NPAs. We need hardly to emphasize that banks should take utmost advantage of these guidelines so that maximum realisation of dues is achieved within the stipulated time; i.e. Government of India has recently made necessary amendments to DRT Act with a view to empower the DRTs for expeditious recovery of dues. Steps have been initiated to constitute 7 additional ; four in Mumbai and one each in Calcutta, Chennai and New Delhi, taking the total number of DRTs to 21.

Some important financial indicators such as CRAR, net NPA and Return on One of the most important challenges facing banking in India currently is the need for effective utilisation of technology in the various facets of banking aimed at not only for improving customer efficiency but also for improving management information systems, better house- keeping including and empirical decision making. Technology has also brought in a sea change in payment and settlement systems which has resulted in the Reserve Bank initiating many measures aimed at reforms in this area. The immediate need in the current scenario is for computerisation of branches of banks and the attendant standardisation of hardware, operating systems and networking platforms to synchronise computerisation with the ultimate goal of development of sound generic architecture model for interconnectivity between branches, the controlling offices and the Head office, using the Indian Financial Network ( implemented  by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology ( The culmination of such efforts would be that almost all branches of banks in the commercially important centres would be inter-connected and be able to transmit messages between Many new payment and settlement products are at various stages of implementation by the Reserve Bank of India. The Centralised Funds Management System ( CFMS), the Securities Settlement System ( SSS), the Real Time Gross Settlement System ( RTGS) and the Structured Financial Messaging System ( SFMS) are some of the major projects which would be of high utilitarian value for banks. It is imperative that if banks have to actively participate in all these systems, they should be in a position to either develop their internal applications to generate messages in these formats or provide for interfaces which would facilitate generation of the is in place, the system would take care of the requirements of large value settlements on a gross basis.

As far as the banking industry is concerned, corporate governance relates to the manner in which the business and affairs of individual banks are directed and managed by their Board of Directors and Senior management. It also provides the structure through which objectives of the institution are set, the strategy of The paper of the BCBS on the subject envisages certain strategies and techniques basic to sound corporate governance in banks. Basic elements of corporate governance are capable and experienced Directors in the Board, efficient Management, coherent strategy and business plan and clear lines of responsibility and accountability.  While the primary responsibility for good corporate governance in banks rests with the Board of Directors, the roles played by the practices in other central banks are being examined by the RBI and guidelines would soon be The standards of accounting and valuation methods adopted by the banks in India are comparable to a great extent to the international standards. The extent of transparency and disclosure standards of balance sheets of banks has been substantially enhanced in a phased manner. Banks have been advised to disclose maturity pattern of deposits, borrowings, investments, advances and foreign currency assets and liabilities, movement in NPAs and lending to sensitive sectors with effect from 31 March 2001.  The existing disclosure standards competitive strength, market standing of banks, etc. These need to be further enhanced to incorporate risk management policies, concentrations, connected lendings, evaluation of The VRS scheme which was introduced by several Public Sector Banks has received a good response. In the immediate future, banks have to ensure that their normal functioning is not disrupted and they complete the consequential part of reallocation and redeployment without delay. This will be accentuated by the fact that banks are going to lose a number of experienced and skilled personnel. Appropriate Human Resources Management policy with a focus on is required to be adopted by the banks in order to carry on the business more efficiently.  Banks should also endeavour to reduce the existing tiers of decision-making and empower personnel at the functional levels adequately for  increasing efficiency and competing An organisational restructuring including branch rationalization and business rationalization I would like to stress that banks need to recognise the concept of change management.

While banks have responded well to the regulatory requirements, they now need to go beyond externally imposed supervision to internally adopted supervision by putting in place standards and Internal Controls which are more stringent than would like to call this approach as .
