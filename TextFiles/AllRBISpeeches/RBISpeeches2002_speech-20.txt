Developing Bond Markets in Emerging Economies :Issues and Indian Experience*Governor Dr. Tarisa Watanagase, Dean, Yoshitomi, Dr. Nachiket Mor, Mr. Joshi & friends,It gives me great pleasure to deliver the keynote address at the Asian Bond Conferenceorganised jointly by the Thai Bond Dealing Centre (Thai BDC),  Fixed Income Money MarketDealers Association of India (FIMMDA) and Primary Dealers Association of India (PDAI).  It isa matter of significance that some of the major self-regulatory organisations (SROs) in the debtmarkets of Asia have taken this initiative to exchange ideas and experiences of the emergingeconomies from Asia and I am sure that this Conference would be mutually beneficial as eachone of us gains valuable insights by absorbing the experience of other countries.The importance of developing domestic bond markets to diversify risks in the financialsystem is being realised since the crisis in Asia in 1997, and development of the GovernmentSecurities Market is of course integrally linked to the development of bond markets. Worldwide,interest in the subject in the recent past is evident from several initiatives taken.  For example,the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) has launched a collaborative effort on thesubject. The IMF and the World Bank are currently finalising guidelines on public debtmanagement.  The IMF is also conducting select country studies in public debt management andIndia has agreed to be a case for study. The Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) recentlyreleased its policy recommendations for Designing New and Balanced Financial MarketStructures in Post-crisis Asia.  I am happy that Mr.Yoshitomi will share the recommendationslater this afternoon.  The theme for the Deputy Governors Meeting at the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS) last December was Development of Debt Markets in Emerging Economies.  Iwould draw heavily from these discussions in flagging issues for consideration while the Indianexperience would illustrate the complexities in addressing some of these issues in a specificcountry context.My address today initially provides an overview of the reasons advocated for thedevelopment of a bond market, followed by a second section giving the possible motivations fordevelopment of bond markets. The third section explains the rationale for development ofGovernment Securities market and the justification for the central bank to be actively involved init.  While section four outlines the key issues relating to the market for Government Securities,the fifth section mentions some aspects relating to the non-Government or corporate bondmarket. The sixth section on select institutional issues deals with the role of institutionalinvestors, self-regulatory organizations, banks in bond markets, credit rating agencies and taxregime. The concluding section makes a few observations on the road ahead for development ofdebt markets in India. 1.  Why Develop Debt Market?First, the basic philosophy of developing a diversified financial system with banks andnon-banks operating in equity markets and debt markets is that it enhances risk pooling and risksharing opportunities for investors and borrowers.  More specifically, the case for ensuring thepresence and development of debt markets is made on several grounds. First, in the absence of adebt market, the banking system would be larger than it otherwise would be.  Prevalence of adomestic debt market can move a crisis outside the banking system making it easier for theGovernment to stand back. As Alan Greenspan has argued, coexistence of domestic bond marketand banking system helps each to act as a backstop for the other. In the past, countries like Japanhave developed with almost total reliance on bank intermediation but the risks of such excessivereliance are more in a relatively open economy since non-bank intermediation may get locatedoutside the country. It is also argued that domestic bond market helps in avoiding the doublemismatches of currency and maturity.Second, it is argued that debt markets facilitate efficient financial intermediation as theyuse market mechanism for allocating and pricing of credit.  In particular, debt markets areexpected to facilitate availability of long-term funds for specific uses such as for infrastructure.They also infuse greater transparency in the process of credit allocation in view of theinformation that is contained in market determined rates. In fact, e-commerce makes informationsharing less costly, and hence it is easier to develop bond market infrastructure in the currentenvironment for facilitating transparent market-based allocation of credit.  It may be difficult forGovernment to intervene through debt market for directed subsidised lending as compared withthe banking system. Hence, it is claimed that debt markets facilitate the reduction of bad loans.Furthermore, since debt instruments are mostly rated, investor awareness and monitoring isgreater, which mitigates the moral hazard arising out of deposit insurance as in the case of banks.Third, debt market can help develop the derivatives market thereby facilitating hedgingmechanisms and enabling greater diversification of risks by participants. Also, the variety ofinstruments possible in the domestic debt market may result in  gains to savers and borrowers.It is also essential to recognise that domestic debt markets may not be able to deliver inreality all that is sought from them.  The efficiency of bond markets would depend on theefficiency of credit rating agencies (CRAs), standards of accounting, auditing and disclosures,institutional infrastructure, prevalence of an environment for enforcement of contracts, etc. Bondmarkets may not necessarily reduce systemic risk since banks themselves could be major playersin bonds as issuers, investors and underwriters.   Development of a debt market for long-terminstruments would also require complementarity of policies such as flexibility in interest rates,enabling legal environment, etc. Though higher degree of transparency is to be expected, it hasbeen argued that where sophisticated instruments like options exist, transparency in debt marketsmay not be automatically ensured.  Furthermore, a domestic bond market by itself need notnecessarily address the fundamental issues of risk management and pricing of risk.On balance, the current realities would lead one to believe that the banking system willcontinue to be at the centre of the financial system in emerging economies.  In fact, banks arelikely to have significant direct or indirect presence in the debt market as issuers, investors orunderwriters.  If the overall environment in the financial sector contains problems in pricing ofrisks by banks, bond markets too can suffer infirmities in pricing.  As the financial system isevolving, bank loans and bond contracts must be treated as complementary and to some extent assubstitutes.  In view of the undeniable benefits of a multi-institutional financial structure, anumber of countries are rightly devoting considerable resources and attention to the developmentof domestic bond markets, though each country may have different motivations for doing so.22.  Motivations for Development of Domestic Debt MarketsThe main provocation for undertaking the task of development of debt markets woulddepend to some extent on the different histories and cultures of countries, but predominantly oneconomic factors such as experience with high inflation, transition from Planning, restructuringeconomies after crisis, etc.  More specifically, and in the context of the financial system, theobjectives may relate to financing Government deficit, funding bank restructuring, creating amore complete financial markets, avoiding banks from taking on excessive credit, riskdiversification in the financial system, conducting monetary policy, sterilising capital inflows,providing a range of long-term assets for pension funds, etc.The impetus in Hong Kong for instance, seems to have come as a market developmentstrategy towards achieving efficient financial intermediation and making the market morecomplete.  Similarly, Singapore reportedly views the debt market as a means of financialintermediation to help credit allocation, and development of corporate bond market was givenhigh priority as an alternative funding source in order to reduce reliance on bank intermediation.In a restructuring economy like Hungary, the motives appear to have been different, viz.,reducing the monetisation of Government deficit, increasing competition to banks which hadwide spreads between deposits and advances and encouraging foreign investment in Governmentdebt in domestic currency.  In the second half of the 1990s, monetary policy considerationsrelating to the information content of the yield curve and concerns with the transmissionmechanism of monetary policy must have added impetus to the development of debt markets.Recapitalisation of banks appears to have been the driving force in Indonesia. In Chile,the debt market developed mainly as an offshoot of pension reforms. The growing pool ofsavings needed Government instruments for investments, whereas the Government had a surplus.The history of over hundred years of inflation seems to have created a demand for inflationindexed bonds.China views Government borrowing as the most important reason for financial deepeningand the Government Securities market provides the lead in development of the bond market.Furthermore, it would be possible to develop the corporate bond market with an efficientbenchmark of Government Securities.In India also, large Government borrowings have provided the impetus for developmentof bond market. A system of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) funding on an automatic basis, theGovernment’s budget deficit at concessional rates of interest was replaced in April 1997 by asystem of RBI financing the temporary mismatches between expenditure and revenue ofGovernment at market aligned interest rates.  Consequent to the dismantling of the administeredinterest rate regime, the borrowing requirements of the Government are now largely raised fromthe market at market related rates.  As India experienced capital inflows and consideredintervention or addition to foreign exchange reserves, it used domestic eligible marketable bondsin its portfolio whenever it wanted to sterilize the money expansion. A deep and liquid debtmarket naturally facilitates this process and in this sense the linkage between capital inflows,sterilization and development of debt markets can also be considered to be an additional reasonfor development of debt market.33.  Need for Widening and Deepening the Government Securities MarketThe relevance of Government Securities can be viewed from three points of view, namelyfrom Government which wants to borrow; from their role in financial markets especially debtmarkets and from the operation of monetary policy.  First, from the viewpoint of theGovernment/fiscal authorities, the development of a deep and liquid Government Securitiesmarket facilitates public borrowings at reasonable costs and avoidance of automatic monetisationof Government deficit by the central bank.  Broad and well-functioning secondary markets areparticularly important where the Government's borrowing needs are substantial.  A welldeveloped Government Securities market provides flexibility to the debt management authoritiesto exercise various options to optimize maturity as well as interest cost to the Government, tominimize the market impact of large or lumpy Government debt operations and, facilitate betterco-ordination between monetary policy and debt management.Second, the Government Securities market provides the backbone of most fixed incomemarkets across the world since it helps pricing of various debt instruments through creation of abenchmark, enables a proper evaluation of risk and acts a conduit for convergence of interestrates in other markets. In addition, the gilts market acts as the channel for the integration ofvarious segments of the domestic financial market and help establish inter-linkages betweeninternal and external financial markets.  It is sometimes argued that it is not always necessary todevelop a Government securities market.  Some countries do not have Government Securitiesmarket because their Governments have no funding requirements and in such countries, alternatebenchmarks have developed so that price discovery has shifted from a single Government marketto a range of non-Government markets. Thus, inter bank repo rates, collateralised obligations,interest rate swaps and top rated corporate bonds have gained acceptance as benchmarks in suchmarkets.Third, a number of countries are moving away from the use of direct instruments toindirect instruments such as repos and direct open market operations. Government Securitiesfacilitate the development of implementing  indirect instruments of monetary policy. Typically,Treasury Bills and Government Dated Securities are ideal instruments for conducting repos inmany emerging economies. While the T-Bills market serves the objective of raising finances forthe Government, it also spurs the development of the money market. An important ingredient inthe development of money market is the terms under which liquidity is available from the centralbank. If liquidity adjustment support is available with certainty in regard to quantity and price, itcould impede the development of the money market as banks will desist from entering intotransactions with each other.   In fact, the link between development of money market and theGovernment Securities is an important aspect of development of debt markets.The primary interest of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in financial markets is becauseof their criticality in acting as the transmission channel for  monetary policy especially whileRBI is moving towards reliance on indirect instruments of monetary policy. The GovernmentSecurities market is the predominant part of the overall debt market and interest rates in thismarket provide benchmarks for the system as a whole. Currently, the RBI is the monetaryauthority, regulator of Government securities market, issuer and manager of Governmentborrowings, for both the Centre and the States, and regulator of money markets as well as forex4markets. The RBI's concern in development of the Government Securities market should be seenin this light, while recognising that the regulation of debt market as a whole, in the context ofpublic issues by corporates and trading in stock exchanges where debt is traded, is in theregulatory jurisdiction of the Securities Exchange Board of India. In India, the RBI considers thatwell functioning markets for Government Securities are necessary for both effective Governmentdebt management and monetary management, while serving the broader interest of developmentof financial markets in general and debt markets in particular.  Accordingly, RBI has taken anumber of initiatives in developing both the primary and secondary markets for GovernmentSecurities.4.  Key Issues Relating to the Government Securities MarketThere are several motivations for and objectives in a central bank being interested indeveloping Government Securities market and hence the issues involved vary in significancefrom country to country as also in the context of the stage of development of markets. The keyissues are : relevance of the money market, operational aspects relating to the primary market,significance of secondary markets, policy conflicts in debt and monetary management anddilemmas in market intervention.Relevance of Development of Money MarketA money market supports the bond market mainly through the process of  liquidity. Inaddition to the importance of money market for financing positions, money market pricesliquidity and anchors the short end of the yield curve. The existence of a repo market helps thedevelopment of an active Government Securities market and vice-versa since lending andborrowing under a safe environment can be fostered through repos. Where interest rates areliberalised and debt management and monetary policy functions are with the central bank, policycoordination needs to be maintained between the Government Securities and money markets.In regard to the money market in India, the basic objective in recent years has been todevelop a short-term yield curve with deep liquidity. A four-fold strategy has been adopted inthis regard. First, a liquidity adjustment facility has been in operation, comprising repo andreverse repo operations through auctions conducted with a view to equilibrating the liquidity andkeeping the short-term interest rates within an informal corridor.  Second, the call money marketis being developed as a pure inter-bank market with a phased withdrawal of non-bankparticipants who are currently lenders in the call money market. Third, the traditional sector-specific refinance support is being rationalized and additional recourse to the establishedliquidity facilities is being made increasingly market-based. Removal of established facilities onfixed terms and moving to a full-fledged Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) is on the activeagenda. Fourth, the other money market segments, especially the repo market are beingdeveloped with lending as well as borrowing access to the non-banks in these markets. To helpthe process, a Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) has been established.Operational Issues Relating to Primary MarketEnsuring efficient price discovery process is a dominant objective of operations inprimary markets and for this purpose putting in place credible systems and ensuring transparentmechanisms are critical.5Auction Technique and Central Bank Participation in AuctionsAuctions are the most common method for sale of Government Securities, thoughsecurities are also distributed through tap sales, syndication and book building process. In manycountries, direct participation in auction is restricted to select investors while a larger investorbase is permitted to enter auctions through designated intermediaries such as banks and PrimaryDealers.  The actual modalities of reaching the investor base would be governed by pragmatismand in fact even choices in auction techniques or even combination of techniques may in somecircumstances be linked to permitted pattern of participation. As regards technique,discriminatory price auctions keep away investors because of the winners curse, whereas thereare dangers of irresponsible bidding and of collusion in a uniform or Dutch type of auction.Countries have moved between discriminatory and uniform price auctions, but there is no settledwisdom as to which type of auction is better. An interesting variant that merits furtherconsideration is a combination of the features of both auctions, i.e., discriminatory price auctionwith a ceiling, in order to mitigate winners curse.In general, central bank participation in auctions is best avoided, but if it becomesnecessary, a central bank ought to participate without competing with other bidders. There is adistinction between a central bank buying Government Securities on its own accord and beingcompelled to do so. In many countries, either there are laws prohibiting central bankparticipation in primary auctions such as in Indonesia and Peru or central banks voluntarilyrestrict themselves from participation as in the case of Malaysia, Philippines and Hungary.In India, auction method has been the most favoured, though such auction could be basedon yield, price or discount, with or without some underwriting commitment of Primary Dealersat the discretion of RBI.  Both discriminatory and uniform price auction techniques are used butthe former is dominant and multiple price auction format is predominantly used for GovernmentSecurities issuances while uniform price auction is used for 91-Day T-Bills.  In the context of theneed to attract retail investors, bids received on non-competitive basis within the notifiedamounts are cut-off at the weighted average yields derived in an  auction.The question of central bank participation as an outsider in primary auction does not arisein India since the RBI itself conducts the auction. The RBI, however, used to take privateplacements liberally in the past but more recently it does  so only in extraordinary situations, andit has also decided to voluntarily move out of devolvements on itself. The Fiscal Responsibilityand Budget Management Bill, which is under consideration, proposes an explicit provision thatprohibits the RBI from purchasing Government Securities in the primary market.InstrumentsCountries have experienced with different types of instruments, to suit their uniquecircumstances, to broaden the markets.  Hungary for instance has gradually moved away fromshort maturity bonds to long-term fixed rate Government bonds enabled by the fact that itavoided hyper-inflation.  Similarly, Israel favoured the simple plain vanilla bonds although thereis a presence of a variety of instruments such as (Consumer Price Index) CPI-linked, fixed-rateand variable-rate bonds and it has progressively lengthened maturities.  Chile favours inflation-indexed bonds.6The RBI has  experimented with different types of instruments such as the fixed couponbonds, zero coupon bonds, capital indexed bonds and more recently floating rate bonds. Most ofthe bonds, however,  are of the fixed coupon variety though  recently Floating Rate Bond issueshave proved to be attractive.Maturity ProfileOn the  maturity profile, there is no ideal solution, but trade-offs between long-term andshort-term maturities on considerations of market preference, cost to Government, bunching ofmaturities, and development of yield curve should be recognised.  Development of Governmentbenchmark securities is an essential element of a well functioning Government Securities marketand this requires the issuer to make conscious efforts to avoid fragmentation and wherenecessary consolidate issuance. Typically, benchmark securities in domestic markets are 2, 3, 5and 10 years, while countries like the USA issue securities up to 30 years. In India, Government revived borrowing at market rates in 1992-93, and most of the newmaturities were compressed below 10 years. This was necessary at the time as it coincided withthe period of the high interest rate cycle, and the successful implementation of the auction systemin the early stages of a move to market related rates of interest required a shortening of thematurity structure.  This resulted in bunching of maturities as well as rendering liquiditymanagement difficult.  In the last two to three years, the RBI’s preference has been towardslonger maturities, at fixed rates to bring about a balance in the maturity structure. There would betimes when  Government is reluctant to lock in what it perceives to be high rates, and the banksface larger asset liability mismatches and greater interest rate risk. Recognising this, the RBI hasreintroduced floating rate bonds and is attempting to develop the STRIPS market in theGovernment Securities segment.   As regards consolidation, RBI has extensively used thetechnique of re-openings of existing securities on the basis of price-based auction. Thus,advantage was taken of large gross borrowing programme to lengthen the maturity profile andconsolidate the profile.Issuance CalendarBased on first principles, it is better to provide a clear and timely information about theborrowing programme through an issuance calendar, in addition to maturity profile ofoutstanding stock, redemption calendar, etc. In operational terms, issuance of a calendar has totackle the trade-off between certainty to the market and flexibility to the issuer in terms ofmarket timing.The uncertain trends in terms of cash flow pattern of the Government of India constrainsthe publication of issuance calendar.  In respect of T-Bills, a pre-announced issuance calendar forauctions has been evolved.  Recognising that a large market borrowing programme anduncertainties in cash flows make issuance of full-fledged calendar somewhat difficult at thisstage, the Finance Minister  announced in the budget speech recently, that there will be acalendar of auctions of Government from the financial year beginning April 2002.Role of Primary DealersMany countries have established a system of licensed Primary Dealers (PDs)  inGovernment Securities as important intermediaries to promote activity in Government Securities7market. Typically, PDs are assigned specific responsibilities like minimum biddingrequirements, giving two-way quotes, providing market information to the central bank, etc. Insome cases,  PDs have been given exclusive right to primary auctions, or some special facilitiesin money market operations, open market operations, underwriting commission, etc. PDs canplay a vital role in the development of the secondary market.  By being in the market, their pricesdiscount all available information, they take up trading positions, and also render valuableassistance to the central bank by providing it with latest market information, designing newinstruments, etc.  Since PDs are generally  highly leveraged, regulatory oversight over PDsappears to be warranted and a common feature among central banks has been to periodicallyreview the performance of PDs and make the continuation of their operations performance-based. An interesting feature that merits notice is a rating of PDs as established in Poland.The institution of PDs has been adopted in India in 1996 for developing both primary andsecondary markets in Government Securities. The main objectives of promoting the institutionalmechanism of PDs are to strengthen institutional infrastructure in the Government Securitiesmarket in order to make it vibrant, liquid and broad based and to ensure development ofunderwriting and market making capabilities for Government Securities outside the RBI so thatthe latter could gradually shed these functions.  In other words, the marketisation of Governmentborrowings and vacation of RBI from primary market in an environment of large borrowingprogramme were facilitated by a conscious development of the institution of PDs.  PDsobligations include giving annual bidding commitment, underwriting the primary issuance andoffering two-way quotes. In return, the PDs are extended liquidity support by the RBI and accessto call money market as borrowers and lenders.Incidentally, RBI experimented with a system of Satellite Dealers (SDs) from 1996 toserve as a second tier to PDs in the Government Securities market with the particular objective ofpromoting retail segment.  However, on a review it was found to be not as useful as wasexpected and is being given up. Gilt Mutual FundsMutual funds dedicated almost exclusively to investments in Government Securitiescalled Gilt Mutual Funds were established in India in April 1996. Currently, there are 13 suchmutual funds in the country.  Mutual funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Boardof India (SEBI).  In tune with the developments that have taken place in the debt markets since1996, the scheme of Gilt Funds is currently being reviewed by the RBI. Given the small size ofthe repo market during that period and the consequent uncertainty regarding availability ofliquidity from the market, Gilt Funds were given limited liquidity support by the RBI.Considering that the liquidity support was introduced as an extraordinary measure and the factthat the repo market has developed and is expected to become more liquid with theoperationalisation of the CCIL, there is a case for reviewing the liquidity support to Gilt Fundsfrom RBI.Significance of Secondary MarketsA diversified investor base with varied demand, maturity profile and risk preference isadmittedly important for ensuring high liquidity and stable demand in the market. Apart frombanks, PDs and mutual funds, retail investors and foreign investors can also play a role in8widening the investor base. Catering to the needs of retail investors is often an essential part ofthe overall strategy to develop a more diversified investor base. Retail investment can alsocontribute to stable demand for Government Securities and can provide a cushion for  the impacton volatility.Development of repo markets, short selling, the role of benchmarks and marked tomarket valuation, etc., do contribute to boosting of secondary market liquidity.  The practice ofshort selling securities facilitated by securities lending and borrowing has been prohibited insome emerging markets and it is necessary to recognise the rationale for this.  No doubt, theability to sell short has a positive effect by increasing the market liquidity and price efficiencysince it enables participants with differing views on the market to trade actively, but short sales,have the potential to increase market volatility and risks especially if the market assumes largerposition than what it is capable of handling.As regards benchmarks, many countries have been taking efforts towards consolidationand creation of benchmarks and the procedures depend on the composition and stock of existingdebt and how much debt is proposed to be raised.  Another issue relates to whether a move tomarked-to-market for investments raises any risks in terms of stop-loss sale, etc.   While marked-to-market serves to encourage secondary market trading, it is necessary to have a liquid marketto correctly price securities.The RBI has taken a number of measures to enhance the secondary market liquidity inthe Government Securities market. These include permitting a diversified participant base,improved fungibility of bonds through reopenings, stabilizing money market through LiquidityAdjustment Facility (LAF), developing the repo market, encouraging the operationalisation ofthe Clearing Corporation of India Ltd., initiating a negotiated dealing system for trading,enforcing marked-to-market requirement for valuation of investments, ensuring a Delivery VsPayment system for settlement of Government Securities in scripless form, and disseminatingdetailed information to the public on a daily basis in respect of all Government Securities tradedin the market.In India, initially the RBI was announcing the yield curve to the market for year-endvaluation. Currently, FIMMDA, a self-regulatory organisation, announces the yield curve, themethodology of which was approved by the RBI. Incidentally, although  the statutory liquidityratio (SLR) for the banking system is 25 per cent, banks are voluntarily holding 37 per cent oftheir liabilities in Government Securities. Recognising the risks involved in such large exposures,the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has created a path for banks to reach a targeted investmentfluctuation reserve over a period.Policy Conflicts in Debt and Monetary ManagementIrrespective of whether the debt management function is vested with the central bank ornot, coordination is important to avoid conflicts between cash and debt management of theGovernment and central bank operations. The timing and amounts of Government Securitiesissuance may not always coincide with the compulsions of the central bank's monetary policy.The Government may wish to issue securities at a time when the market is illiquid and thecentral bank needs to consider whether or not and to what extent it will provide additional9liquidity. Liquidity can be provided through the secondary market or where the central bank isboth the debt and monetary manager, it has the option to operate through the primary market.Currently, almost all central banks are harmoniously co-ordinating with the fisc, both atthe policy and operational levels with regard to debt management. There is general agreementthat being the fiscal agent creates problems for central bank and separation of debt managementfunction from the central bank would remove the friction. In a situation of high fiscal deficit andlack of fiscal assurances on its responsibility, separation of the two functions could increase therisk of macro instability. Controlling the fisc, developing financial markets and setting in placeinstitutional and technological infrastructure ideally should precede such separation.The monetary policy statement of the RBI of October 2001 had clearly indicated theintentions in this regard and the conditions that would need to be fulfilled to make this separationpossible.  The RBI acknowledged that although it is desirable in principle, separation of debt andmonetary management functions is a medium-term process that is dependent on the fulfillmentof three conditions, viz., development of financial markets, reasonable control over the fiscaldeficit and necessary legislative changes.  Of course, institutional arrangements for establishing aseparate Debt Office need to be thought through. The Federal nature of the country adds anotherdimension to the issue namely should each State and Central Governments have a public debtoffice while replacing RBI. One method could be to set up an independent corporate entitystructure to manage the debt of both Centre and the States.Dilemmas in Intervention in MarketsOn the proposition that since markets are maturing there is a case for central bankintervention to even out price volatility, there is a general consensus against intervention in thenormal course. There are many central banks that never intervene in the bond markets tosmoothen volatility. In fact, lowering volatility impedes secondary market development bypreventing hedging instruments from developing, which in turn are necessary to deal withvolatility.There are however, situations justifying an interventionist approach by central banks.  Forinstance, the September 11, 2001 incident required the Federal Reserve to be involved intimatelyin the market. India has had many such situations like the border conflicts and US sanctions, etc.where the RBI had shown its willingness to be present in the market without creatingexpectations of being a market maker.  Thus, there is a need to differentiate between normalmarket conditions and exogenous shocks in taking a view on intervention.  While in the case ofexogenous shocks, intervention or expression of intention to do may be necessary, during normalmarket conditions the option should always be available but, actual exercise is to beconvincingly dictated by evolving circumstances with a directional preference to strengthenmarket forces.On the intervention policy of RBI, three areas need to be highlighted.  First, in the moneymarket, the RBI is concerned mainly with liquidity management through the LiquidityAdjustment Facility and effectively operates an interest rate corridor between the repo andreverse repo rates. Second, in the context of market borrowing programme, the RBI interventionis through private placement under extraordinary circumstances since the RBI has the10responsibility to raise Government debt. In other words, if in the RBI’s assessment the marketwould not be in a position to absorb the debt without disruption, it resorts to private placement.Third, when the bids in auction are unacceptable, the RBI takes on a devolvement, which inactual practice has been negligible during the last two years. Primary Dealers underwrite issuesof Government paper for which they are paid underwriting commission. Thus, the twincombination of high fiscal deficit and a narrow and not so liquid market necessitates RBIintervention in the interest of financial stability. There are, however, no rules regarding sale ofsecurities taken on private placement in terms of maximum period of holding etc. It is at theRBI’s discretion to offload securities taken on private placement when conditions are conducive.When capital flows occur and the capacity to monetise Government debt is circumscribedby sterilisation, the maneuverability to conduct market borrowing is constrained. In the currentfinancial year, for instance, the RBI has added $ 8 billion to its foreign currency reserves. Tomeet externally induced shocks in forex markets, the RBI had in the past conductedextraordinary operations and in the process considered it essential to create a firewall to preventits transmission to the bond market.  A by-product of erecting firewalls was that, whenever thecentral bank has resorted to monetary actions on exchange market considerations, or even whenbond yields have moved sharply on sentiments, it has tended to create expectations of liquidityaction in the bond markets. These are complexities that all concerned learn to live with.5.  Development of Corporate Bond Market To develop corporate bond market, the authorities have to actively consider increasingthe supply of high quality paper, creating adequate institutional investor base, ensuring a varietyof instruments of differing maturities and mounting supporting infrastructure, etc. Emphasis alsoneeds to be placed on efficient legal systems as important infrastructure for deep and liquid bondmarkets. Among legal reforms, bankruptcy laws or capacity to seize collaterals are particularlyimportant.  Experience also indicates that in many emerging countries, since the risk istransferred to the creditor in bond markets as compared to banks, there is a preponderant biastowards bank deposits among household savers in many countries.  In other words, developmentof domestic corporate debt market is bound to be a long drawn process and banks will have tocontinue to be special and dominant in the financial systems of most emerging economies.In Mexico, while the experience is that larger companies issue bonds abroad, the smallercompanies prefer to borrow from banks. In Chile, there is some substitutability between bankand bond financing as a few companies raise bonds to prepay bank debt. Pre-crisis, Korea had alarge corporate bond market and the biggest lesson from the episode was that too muchGovernment intervention (either in exchange rate or implicit or explicit guarantees) resulted inserious distortion of markets.In many emerging economies, the corporate bond markets are fragmented. Poland forexample has a fragmented and illiquid corporate bond market characterised by private placementand cross holdings. Peru is experiencing a situation where good credit was going to banks whilebad credit was going to bond markets; hence there is a justified reluctance to invest in bonds. Onthe other hand, this raises the contrary view-point that if bond markets are developed, bad creditcould go to banks. There is, however, no evidence of this so far and moreover ex ante there areonly well-priced and badly-priced loans.11There is a recognition of the need to develop securitization market as a related issue.Securitization as an instrument acts as a risk transfer mechanism that could work to theadvantage of both banks and investors. In Korea, non-performing loans spurred this market;Hongkong has established a Mortgage Corporation. In many countries, this market is in nascentstage, either because it needs complicated legal changes or the credit environment does notenable securitization. For instance, Hungary has no non-performing loans nor mortgage inhousehold; hence no mortgage exists to warrant securitisation to be involved in the developmentof this market.The Reserve Bank of India's role in development of corporate bond market is indirect andgoverned by its interest in monetary policy transmission, Government Securities, and stability aswell as efficiency in financial sector as a whole. As mentioned, the major preoccupation has beenwith Government Securities market for all the reasons explained.  The corporate bond marketcommenced in a significant way with Public Sector Undertakings being encouraged to takerecourse to them in late eighties, but the private corporate sector's debt requirements were metlargely by development financial institutions and banks.  With developments in capital marketand establishment of rating agencies, corporates and development financial institutionsthemselves started taking recourse to debt, since the reform commenced.   More recently, specialpurpose vehicles to fund infrastructure promoted by some State Governments have come to thefore especially since they are backed by State Government guarantees.Corporate debt market in the sense of private corporate sector raising debt through publicissuance in capital markets is only an insignificant part of Indian debt market. When we talk ofdebt markets in India, we are really referring to the Government Securities market, whichaccounts for 75 per cent of the outstanding stock and nearly 95 per cent of the volumes traded inthe secondary market. About 90 per cent of the corporate debt market is privately placed. In theprivately placed market, 58 per cent of the issuances are by financial institutions and banks, bothin the public and private sector and about 26 per cent represents  issues of public sectorundertakings and central/state government guaranteed bonds. Two-thirds of the total issues areaccounted for by the public sector. 20 per cent of the total corporate debt issuance is by theprivate non-financial sector.Most issuers in the corporate debt  market are AAA or AA rated borrowers and about 10per cent may be unrated. The investors are mostly institutions with very few retail investors.Hence, at the first stage of development of the bond markets, while securitisation takes place, thedisintermediation process is only partial. Transparency is limited both in the primary and thesecondary markets, liquidity is poor and many bonds are held till redemption. The legal recoursein case of non-payment of interest and principal is complicated and bankruptcy laws afford littlecomfort. The legal and regulatory requirements, accounting and auditing standards for issuersand the infrastructure for trading, clearing and settlement need to be developed much more incase the market has to become deep and liquid.As the non-transparent practices in this market is a matter of concern, RBI had issuedguidelines in June 2001 regarding the due diligence to be undertaken, the disclosures to beobtained and the credit risk analysis to be made in regard to privately placed investmentsespecially for unrated instruments.  Banks have been advised to adopt an internal system of12rating for issues of non-borrowers, whether rated or otherwise, and adopt prudential limits tomitigate adverse impact of concentration and illiquidity.  Banks have been also  advised to put inplace proper risk management systems for capturing and analysing the risks so as to take timelyremedial measures.  A further review of non-SLR investments in the light of recentdevelopments reveals that the ease of mobilising funds through privately placed debt issuescould lead to the use of such funds for risky purposes other than what is disclosed in the offerdocument.In order to contain the risks arising out of non-SLR investment portfolio of banks andFIs, in particular through the private placement route, it was proposed by the RBI to issue furtherprudential guidelines to be observed by banks. The draft guidelines were circulated to the banksand FIs in October 2001. These guidelines primarily focus on the need for strengthening ofinternal rating systems, fixing of prudential limits and sub-limits, review of rating changes inrespect of issuers and non-performing investments; and most important,  disclosures in ‘Notes onAccounts’ regarding issuer composition and non-performing investments.As announced in Mid-Term Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2001 – 2002, theRBI constituted a Working Group under the chairmanship of Mr.S.R.Iyer, Chairman CreditInformation Bureau of India Ltd., to evolve a framework for collecting and sharing of banks/ FIsof information on private placement of debt and prescribing minimum requirements for issuers tomeet before banks/FIs consider investment in such debt.  The Report is due very soon.The major pre-occupation of the RBI in regard to corporate debt is to ensure that banks andfinancial institutions are protected from the risks in the current state of markets as also aid theprocess of qualitative changes in the corporate debt markets.6. Institutional Issues           There are several institutional issues related to debt markets and each of them is criticalbut they are not necessarily interrelated.  These are many, but this section focusses on some ofthem, namely, institutional investors in debt markets, self-regulatory organisations, banks, creditrating agencies and the tax regime.Role of Institutional InvestorsThere is wide consensus regarding the need for institutional building for development ofdebt markets, though countries have approached it differently.  The notion of pension reforms asan important instrument in the process is generally upheld although there is a case for regulatorylimits on their investments in riskier assets in the interest of financial stability.There are several approaches to improving institutional investors' interest in domesticdebt markets.  For example, Indonesia is currently embarking on substantial regulatory reformsto encourage institutional investors. Hungary is emphasizing development of mutual funds.Some countries like Philippines are concentrating on market for securitisation.  Hong Kongprefers a portfolio approach, a greater role for credit rating agencies, to build CollectiveInvestment Vehicles and to explore other options like credit enhancements, rather than increasethe supply of Government or quasi-Government paper to whet the appetite of pension funds(PFs).  In general, PFs are encouraged to invest in Government Securities as in the case of Chile,13Indonesia and Singapore although some countries like Hungary and Philippines are permittingsome portfolio diversification by allowing investment within limits, in non-Government paper. Itis also observed that many pension or provident funds voluntarily invest in GovernmentSecurities above the minimum requirements.In the case of India, investments by Provident Funds are governed by GovernmentRegulation, which indicates that 40 per cent of their incremental accretions each year areinvested in Central and State Government Securities. This is followed by 40 per cent  inbonds/securities of public financial institutions and Certificate of Deposits issued by publicsector banks of which a maximum of 10 per cent is permitted in rated private corporatedebentures. Investment in this category is usually mopped up by development financialinstitutions, which are themselves financial intermediaries. Moreover, the pension fundsthemselves being conservative, prefer to invest in Government Securities.  Thus, the resources ofthe PFs are preempted by the Government and DFIs, making  the linkage between PFs andcorporate debt market  tenuous.Role of Self-Regulatory OrganisationsSelf-regulation is fast emerging as a viable co-operative framework for both the regulatorand market participants to come together towards the fulfilment of common goals and objectives.By creating a unique combination of private interests and official oversight, SROs have emergedas an effective and efficient form of regulation for the complex and dynamic financial servicesindustry.  International experience with self-regulation suggests that the power of self-regulatoryorganisations vary significantly. In its most complete form, self-regulation encompasses theauthority to create, amend, implement and enforce rules of conduct with respect to the entitiessubject to the SRO’s jurisdiction and to resolve disputes through arbitration or other means.Typically, this authority is derived from a statutory delegation of power to a non-governmentalentity. In some countries, SROs do not have formal regulatory status but nevertheless providecodes of good conduct and master agreements and perform important roles in the standardisationof common practices without any formal regulatory status.  It is necessary to recognise thatexercise of authority in any form by SRO does raise some fundamental issues such as theiraccountability and monopoly status.  There is merit in constantly reviewing both therepresentative nature of SROs and responsiveness to overall public interest considerations.          In the context of Indian debt market, self-regulatory bodies like the Fixed Income MoneyMarket and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) and the Primary Dealers Association ofIndia (PDAI) have been encouraged in the recent past, as part of reform process to give animpetus to the development of the bond and money markets in India. These bodies have servedas crucial layers between the regulator and market and have contributed to developing newbenchmarks and products besides providing training and development support to participants.They have formulated guidelines for dispute resolution mechanisms and are also involved in theprocess of developing standard practices and codes of conduct.  Both PDAI and FIMMDA arerepresented in the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of the Reserve Bank of India onGovernment Securities and Money Markets.  FIMMDA is involved in the task of valuation of allCentral Government Securities. The daily yield curve based on benchmark Central Governmentbonds is fast emerging as an accepted benchmark to price securities. In addition to this,FIMMDA has also been contributing to developing guidelines for documentation of repo,14securitised debt and several other debt market instruments.  The activities of both SROs areclosely co-ordinated with policies of RBI while their functioning is also carefully and constantlyobserved by RBI.Banks and Bond MarketsThe relationship between banks and bond markets is complex especially in emergingcountries where the dominance of banks in financial intermediation is set to gradually decline butbanks do have a critical role in development of debt markets.  Banks operate as issuers,investors, underwriters and guarantors.  Banks may also securitise loans and thus participate inlong-term debt markets.  In the process, the regulator of banks has a responsibility to ensure thatbanks' participation in debt markets, both as issuers and investors is consistent with their riskmanagement.  The vagaries of debt markets do impact the balance sheets of banks, while banks’confidence and participation in debt markets influence the growth and liquidity in the markets.In some countries, banks have been active participants in equity markets but their small presencein debt markets may be partly explained by the less developed nature of debt markets,particularly in Asia.In India, the banking system which incidentally has been dominated by the public sector,played a pioneering role in initiating growth of mutual funds, merchant banking and otherfinancial services.  Structurally, banks have been permitted to operate through subsidiaries asasset management companies, PDs, merchant banks and mutual funds.  The DevelopmentFinancial Institutions also played a role but they dominated in promoting credit rating agencies,sponsoring national stock exchanges, depositories, etc.  In regard to Government Securitiessegment of the market, which accounts for about 75 per cent of the stock, about 60 per cent ofthe stock is held by the banking system.  As regards the corporate debt segment, both privateplacement and public issue, over half of the issuance is by banks and financial institutions.  Thecorporates, especially the large corporate segment move in and out of bank advances and debtmarkets just as banks also participate in both.In this background, the RBI continuously reviews the nature and extent of linkages andadopts a wide range of mechanisms to enhance efficiency and impart stability.  Phasedderegulation of limits for banks' investments in non-Government debt instruments wasaccompanied by exposure norms, other prudential guidelines, valuation norms for debtinstruments and asset liability management guidelines.  The maturity profile and issue ofinnovative instruments in Government Securities market were also attuned to meet varyingportfolio needs.  In addition to risk weights for interest rate risks, a target has been indicated forestablishing investment fluctuation reserve.  Legal changes have also been announced in thebudget to create a market for securitisation.  Development Financial Institutions have also beenpermitted greater flexibility to operate on their liabilities and asset sides in debt instruments.Role of Credit Rating AgenciesBanks do possess intimate and specialised knowledge of the borrowers and are thus in aunique position to assess the risks in advances, while in the case of large number of investors indebt markets, such knowledge and skill are usually lacking. Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) helpmitigate this problem of asymmetric information and the dissemination of information by theCRA incidentally makes the regulator's task less onerous. CRAs have also faced a number of15criticisms in recent years, especially after the Asian crisis.  The independence of ratings has beenquestioned, especially when ratings are paid for their services.  Questions are also raised aboutthe accountability of CRAs, the potential for herding by investors and frequent changes in ratingscausing volatility.  Excessive reliance on CRAs is, under these circumstances to be eschewed andin any case the quality of ratings by CRAs continuously assessed. Some regulators prescribe thatpension funds invest in debt instruments of investment grade only.  Credit rating has also beenprescribed by regulators as the basis for exemption from registration norms for issuers of assetbacked securities.  Some regulators insist on a minimum rating for corporates to become eligiblefor issuance of Commercial Paper.  Furthermore, specific credit rating limits have been made onthe eligibility criteria for issuance of bonds in some countries.In India, there are four CRAs and each of them has collaboration with internationallyrenowned CRAs to supplement the local knowledge and skills. The RBI prescribes a number ofregulatory uses of ratings.  Of those related to the money and debt markets, a corporate must getan issue of Commercial Paper rated and may issue such paper subject to a minimum rating.SEBI, which incidentally is the regulator of CRAs has stipulated that ratings are compulsory onall public issues of debentures with maturity exceeding 18 months.  Pension funds can onlyinvest in debt securities that have high ratings, as per the stipulations of Government.A trend over the last few years in India is the preference for CRAs to extensively rateprivate placement resulting in financial institutions' distinct preference for investment in ratedpaper often through private placement and sometime over normal credit.  Such a trend ofabdicating the responsibility for assessment of risk is not desirable from the point of view ofbanks.  RBI has been issuing detailed guidelines to banks and financial institutions in regard toexercising their judgement and risk assessment while taking into account the CRAs ratings.  Thelatest guidelines emphasise the importance of such internal assessments even when the ratedpaper happens to be backed by guarantees of Government.  Thus, while CRAs are necessary,their presence is not a sufficient condition for development of sound debt markets.Tax Regime and Debt MarketsAn efficient tax regime should ensure that it does not create an impediment to thedevelopment of secondary debt market.  Distortions may be created if, without clear justification,some participants are exempted from tax as compared to another, certain instruments are taxedwhile others are exempted  and procedures for  calculating tax or deducting tax at source distortsprices.  Similarly, lack of clarity in provisions could also hamper trading in certain segments ofthe debt market.  While the process of reform would have to be initiated in a given tax regime,with the evolution of reform, and as the market, institutions and instruments develop, the taxregime would need to be modified to suit the changing circumstances.The removal of tax deduction at source (TDS) on Government Securities market in a wayheralded the beginning of the taxation reforms in debt markets.  The result was the end to thepractice of voucher trading in the Government Securities market thus removing pricingdistortions in the market.  The incidence of stamp duty had been for a long time a majorimpediment to the development of debt markets.  The amendments to the Indian Stamp Act,1899 have exempted debt instruments dealt in demat form from the applicability of stamp duty16(Government Securities as such are exempted from the stamp duty).  This  encouraged dematholding/transactions in debt instruments, as also trading in debt instruments.In the latest Budget, some more rationalisation measures in the tax regime wereannounced.  First, the earlier exemption to equity mutual fund from the dividend tax placed thedebt mutual funds at a disadvantage.  The recent Finance Bill, has however, proposed theabolition of the distribution tax of 10 per cent on companies and mutual funds on the dividendsor income distributed by them.  Such income will henceforth be taxed in the hands of therecipients at the rates applicable to them and subject to TDS.  The dividend tax exemptionavailable to the equity-oriented mutual funds, however, is withdrawn and the dividends will betaxable in the hands of the recipients at 10 per cent.  This move has to some extent reduced thedisadvantages faced by the debt-oriented funds.Second, the recent amendments to Section 47 of the IT Act, facilitating securities lendingand borrowing operations will ensure safe and smooth settlement through the recentlyestablished CCIL.Third, the prevailing tax treatment for zero coupon bonds resulted in distorting tradingpractices in these instruments.  The recent notification issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes(CBDT) in bringing about rationalisation in the tax treatment for the deep discount bonds, apartfrom removing the distortions will keep the market in readiness for the development of STRIPSin Government Securities and facilitate a zero coupon yield curve.For the financial system as a whole, the Expert Committee to Review the System ofAdministered Interest Rates and other Related Committees (2002) has made certainrecommendations on the tax regime, which if implemented would remove some distortions andensure a level playing field among participants and instruments in the financial markets.  Thesemeasures coupled with the decision to align the administered interest rates with market rates ofinterest should pave the way for significant improvement in the environment for debt markets.7.  Road Ahead for Indian Debt MarketsThere have been several occasions when measures contemplated in India fordevelopment of debt markets especially Government Securities markets have been articulated byRBI. In this concluding part of my address, I will list the milestones to be reached within one- ortwo-year time span.On the legal side, several measures are under way.  First, as the Finance Minister, in hisUnion Budget 2002-03, has announced, a new Government Securities Bill, which has sincereceived the concurrence of all the State legislators, replacing the existing Public Debt Act of1944, would be introduced in the current session of the Parliament.  The new Act will facilitatewider participation in Government Securities markets as it will provide necessary protection tothe beneficial owners through Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounts, enablelien marking and pledge of securities for raising loans against Government securities, recognitionof electronic form of record maintenance, enlargement of dematerialization facility through BondLedger Accounts, liberalisation of norms relating to nomination and legal representation,facilitate easier transfer and allow for stripping of securities.17Second, the Fiscal Responsibility and  Budget Management Bill which has already beenconsidered by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance is also expected to beintroduced in the Parliament in this session. The Bill seeks to limit the fiscal deficit, place limitson public debt and eliminate RBI’s participation in the primary market issue of datedGovernment Securities, thereby paving the way for separation of debt management frommonetary management.  The amendments to the RBI Act, which are under consideration of theGovernment, would take away the mandatory responsibility of RBI to act as debt manager toGovernment of India and thereby facilitate such separation, which is one of our major medium-term objectives.Third, in pursuance with the recommendations of the Expert Committees set up by RBIand Government of India. a new Bill is also proposed to be introduced in the Parliament tostrengthen creditors’ right to foreclosure and enforcement of securities by banks and financialinstitutions.  This Bill will also enable securitisation of money locked up in long-term loans,thereby further strengthening the legal basis for transactions in such new debt securities.For development of the market and to encourage retail participation, particularly by mid-segment investors like urban co-operative banks, NBFCs, trusts, etc., non-competitive biddingscheme allowing 5 per cent of the amount issued under select auctions by Government wasintroduced in January 2002.  The amount could be revised to 10 per cent keeping in view, theresponse.  Floating Rate Bonds (FRBs) were reintroduced recently in two launches in Novemberand December 2001.  Certain percentage of total Government borrowings could be earmarkedfor such FRBs to provide good hedging instruments  to banks/other investors to minimise theirinterest rate risk.  With clarifications issued by Government of India recently in the tax treatmentof zero coupon bonds, decks have been cleared to introduce STRIPS which would satisfy thesegmental needs of the market.  Necessary preparatory work for software development is beingtaken up.  To provide transparency and stability in the market, as announced by the FinanceMinister in the recent Union Budget, a calendar of primary issues for the first half of the nextfiscal will be announced soon.On the institutional development side, the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL),which was set up in April 2001, has commenced its operations since February 15, 2002.  CCIL,acts as the central counter party in Government Securities for trades accepted for clearing andsettlement through Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) with automated connectivity with theDelivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement system.  It provides guaranteed settlement oftransactions in Government Securities now. The reduction in number of transactions forsettlement with RBI will bring down the associated risk, cost and time in completion ofsettlement.  The establishment of CCIL is expected to  pave way for entry of non-SGLparticipants for repos market and repos in corporate debt instruments thereby improving liquidityin debt market.  We hope this will become possible within the next one year. The CCIL will alsoact as a central counter party for settlement of forex transactions. This is expected to be put inplace within the next six months.On the technology side, as part of NDS-PDO computerisation project, NegotiatedDealing System which provides for screen based electronic dealing system for trading in18Government Securities and money market instruments including repos and electronic bidding inthe primary auction of Central and State Government Securities/Treasury Bills has alsocommenced its operations since February 15, 2002.  At this stage, it has been possible to invitebids for primary auctions on the NDS for daily repos under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)and for reporting secondary market trades on near real time basis. The submission of manualSGL form has been done away with and direct links established between reporting oftransactions, their confirmation and settlement in a DVP 2 system. By end of 2002, we canexpect a centralised PDO with connectivity to all 15 centres of RBI, complete automation of allservices for investors and completion of primary market operations with seamless linkages tosettlement system.  Very soon, we also intend to place on real time basis, information availableon NDS in the public domain.  This will facilitate transparency and also enable banks/PDs toservice their clients better at various parts of the country.To facilitate faster funds transfer for debt market settlements, Electronic Fund Transfer(EFT) facility, which is now available at 13 centres covering more than 8,000 branches, will beavailable at 40 centres in the next 6 months after integration with SBI managed clearing housescovering almost 75 per cent of the transactions.  Contract for a state of the art Real Time GrossSettlement System (RTGS) has been awarded in October 2001 and it is expected to beoperationalised in the first quarter of 2003, thereby facilitating funds settlement at real time grossbasis, which will ensure finality of settlement. By next year, securities trading and settlementwill link to the RTGS.7. ConclusionThe road ahead for the next year is thus fairly clear but on the way forward, there areseveral issues which need to be addressed.  Let me at this stage flag a few of these issues for thebenefit of your deliberations.First, heterogeneity of market participants in terms of transaction needs, risk assessmentsand investment horizons needs to be encouraged to lend greater stability to the market.  With theliberalisation and activation of insurance sector, long-term saving through debt instruments isbound to increase and the debt market will have an important role to play in this regard.Mr.Rangachary, Chairman of the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) hadraised the issue of lengthening of maturities of Government Securities and the RBI had assuredfulfillment of this requirement of the insurance sector.  Also, pension reforms have made a startin the recent Union Budget.  This is bound to result in an increased demand for long-term debtsecurities. In addition, the SLR requirements of cooperative banks and NBFCs are increasing.  Itwould be necessary to ensure easy availability of Government Securities to meet this demand.Second, in the above context of greater thrust on market players with differentperceptions, retailing of Government Securities assumes great importance.  A three-prongedstrategy would seem ideal viz., a greater role by PDs in providing liquidity so that exit route isavailable always for the retail investor; banks and major custodians to facilitate investment andease of transactions for retail demand; and establishing order-driven trading system in stockexchanges with adequate safeguards.19Third, in view of the in-principle decision taken to discontinue the system of SatelliteDealers, time is appropriate for a review of the system of PDs in terms of their number in thesystem, obligations, activities and regulation.  In this regard, a decision in the RBI has alreadybeen taken to bring the PDs under the supervision of Board for Financial Supervision of the RBI.Fourth, as regards non-Government debt markets, the major issue of private placementswill have to be squarely addressed sooner than later. In this context, ensuring greatertransparency, adequate disclosures, enhanced efficiency, and proper accounting standards wouldbe in the larger interest of development of debt markets.Let me conclude by submitting that we in RBI are keen to understand theory and practiceof debt market but eschew ideological extremes.  We want to gain from the experience of othersbut chart our own course of action.  We are aware of the complexities and the difficult roadahead.  We approach the tasks with caution, humility and flexibility, but with determination toreach international best practices as suited to India's evolving needs.Let me wish the deliberations all success and we look forward to learning from theexpertise and experience of the distinguished participants.Thank you.March 11, 2002* Keynote Address by Dr.Y.V.Reddy, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Asian Conference, jointlyhosted by FIMMDA, PDAI, and Thai BDC at Bangkok on March 11, 2002. Dr.Reddy is thankful to Dr.A.Prasad,Mrs.Usha Thorat and officers of Internal Debt Management Cell of the RBI for their assistance.20
