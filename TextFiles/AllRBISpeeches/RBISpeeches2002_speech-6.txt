Key Note Address at the Assembly of the Forex Dealers' Association of India atBangalore on September 28, 2002 delivered by Smt K.J.Udeshi, Executive Director,RBIMr.Pravin Gupta, Chairman, Forex Association of India, Mr Tyagarajan, GeneralSecretary, other dignitaries present here, ladies and gentlemen,It is indeed a great pleasure to be amidst you all this evening. This is my firstparticipation in the Forex Assembly.  The first thing however that came to my mind whenMr Gupta approached me is that, thankfully there could not be a more opportune time formy first visit when all is apparently well with the forex market world and forex reservesare burgeoning.  I thought I would take the opportunity to set out the rationale of thechanges in exchange control in the context of the overall policy of liberalisation andmove towards full capital account convertibility.  In the external sector, India is markedout as a country which has opted for a gradual and measured liberalisation.  I would in noway wish to be an apologist for our approach.  In fact, we are now recognisedinternationally as a model country that has calibrated well the liberalisation of its externalsector without any significant backtracking. We have completed a decade of liberalisation in the foreign exchange market.  Theexchange rate policy has been fashioned, more specifically after 1992, to enhance the roleof market forces without disrupting the basic fabric of the market structure. There hasbeen consistent effort to bring about selective linkage between the global and domesticmoney markets through the forex market. With these objectives in view over the yearsoperational freedom both to the end users and the intermediaries have been extended.The major change came about in 1992 with LERMS and subsequently unified exchangerate in 1993 when RBI withdrew from fixing daily prices in currency. While theunification of exchange rates and a market determined exchange rate regime was a majorstep in the liberalisation process there was also progressive liberalisation of transactionsboth on current and capital accounts. The introduction of the direct quotation system in1993 and the termination of RBI announcing it’s buying and selling rates in 1995 wereimportant miles stones in moving towards a market determined exchange rate.2The dilemma posed to the policy makers was to manage volatility without deviating fromthe path of market development.RBI's response to volatile exchange rate movements has been a combination of monetarypolicy and administrative measures together with intervention. A significant change inapproach was made in 1998 following the sharp volatility experienced in internationalmarkets. The provisions, which allowed incentives for speculation to end-users andintermediaries, were identified and withdrawn. The focus of operation shifted directlyfrom intervening in the market to identifying those demands that could rectify theimbalance viz. oils payments and bunched demands were smoothened by RBI.  The RBIdoes not target any exchange rate or resist fundamentals.  Thus leads and lags havebecome the major focus of exchange rate management.  The RBI’s operations have allalong aimed at evening out the imbalances and smoothening the process of two-waychanges.  The market has developed greater strength, has become much deeper andliquid, credibility of the currency has enhanced in the eyes of the global players andgreater confidence in the system among investors. The entire spectrum of relaxationswhich were temporarily withdrawn have been more or less restored.    The Central Bankand the market participants are exploring issues at the frontiers and I do hope thattomorrows' deliberations will be constructive and enable us to jointly forge ahead.A careful analysis of the RBI's stance would reveal the balance it had to establishbetween freedom on flows in the capital account and the need for increasing the degree ofoperational freedom to the market participants.  The objective was to ensure efficientprice discovery mechanism reflecting the economic fundamentals not distorted by thespeculative instincts of a few.  The issue of volatility is not the preoccupation of only thethRBI. As recently as 20 September 2002 the Bank of England Governor stated and Iquote “…The recent volatilities seen in the financial markets are frustrating. The movementsare disjointed from the economic fundamentals.”Earlier in the year in the context of the USD gyrations US Treasury Secretary stated :3“… The people who benefit from roiling the world currency market are speculators andas far as I am concerned they provide not much useful value…”RBI had to craft a careful strategy to address the elements of speculation without injuringthe genuine interests of the market players.  The endeavour to develop a deep and liquidmarket reflecting domestic and global realities within our constraints has been preserved.The market today provides freedom for risk management, freedom for asset substitution,freedom for taking limited view on rates by corporates without foreign currencyexposures, freedom for anticipatory cover. The basic philosophy around which themarket has been built is that any entrant to the market must have an underlying exposure.As stated by the Reserve Bank Governor, today we can look back at the developmentswith a reasonable degree of satisfaction.The issue of Capital Account Convertibility (CAC)The Asian financial crisis led to a rethinking of the various issues relating to the CAC.Earlier, CAC was the mantra on everyone’s lips and even international agencies like theIMF were nudging - not too gently - countries like India towards liberalising the capitalaccount. While on the subject of capital account convertibility, I recall the observationsof our Governor, Dr.Bimal Jalan and I quote, “...It must be understood that merely bylifting all capital controls, the markets of a developing country do not get as deeplyintegrated as a developed country’s markets.  As such, each country would need to decideon its own path of capital account liberalization with regard to the timing andsequencing”.  The critical role played by a well capitalised, well managed and well-regulated financial system which has all along been stressed by the Indian authorities hascome into sharper focus. Further, the dangers from a highly leveraged corporate structurewithout proper norms for corporate governance are better appreciated.   Needless to say,the fiscal position has to be taken into account.As far as developing markets in general are concerned, there would be six tenets thatwould need to be kept in mind by the authorities while deciding on the pace of capitalaccount liberalisation.4First, it is not necessary for a country to have a totally open capital account.  Secondly, itis imperative to make a distinction between controls that hinder efficient internationalintermediation and those that are necessary to control potential problems whilesequencing the capital account liberalisation.Thirdly, a developing country with underdeveloped financial markets should reserve theright to reimpose controls if warranted.  By a well paced calibration of the liberalisationprocess we have had a remarkable record of  minimal backtracking.Fourthly, it is important to remember that it is necessary to have an overall environmentwhere the measures on outflows are well sequenced.Fifthly, the Asian Crisis clearly demonstrated the dangers of hidden risks in the balancesheets of highly leveraged corporates. Therefore, information about the potential impactof corporate activity at times of crisis could prove very useful to the authorities. ReserveBank took a definite step in this regard recently by directing banks to collect informationrelating to unhedged exposures of their clients.Finally, it is important to recognise that the more we liberalise the more we would needto monitor flows and we need not be defensive of the monitoring of flows.Some facts about capital account liberalisation.In the absence of a well chalked out sequencing, the liberalisation of capital account hasoften been followed by crisis in many countries. It is often a mistake to over emphasisethe permissive factor of capital account liberalisation while under estimating theimportance of weakness in fiscal policy as well as the compatibilities between thedesirable monetary and exchange rate policies and the actual ones followed in practice.At the same time, it also stands to reason that the cost of maintaining controls and theinefficiencies and distortions that result should be carefully evaluated. Nevertheless,given the fact that effect of a crisis is often of a long term nature as far as real sector ofthe economy is concerned, economists are increasingly recognising the merit of agradual, well thought out, prioritised opening up of capital account.5What lessons do we need to draw from the episodes of crises in other countries?  First,countries need to pursue sound macro economic and trade policies to minimise risk whilecarefully opening up the capital account.  Secondly, countries should strengthen theirfinancial and supervisory systems before going capital account convertible. Thirdly, astrong corporate sector with good governance is an essential pre-requisite for a fasteropening up of the capital account. Fourthly, CAC essentially pre-supposes a marketdetermined exchange rate system. This brings me to the issue of India’s march towardsCAC, which has hastened in recent times and our efforts at liberalising variousprocedures.There is an erroneous impression in certain quarters which are meant to be otherwise wellinformed.  It is stultifying to claim that the Indian approach to CAC is one of encouraginginflows while discouraging outflows.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Capitalinflows were always encouraged and repatriability assured.  In fact, the thrust of thepolicy in recent years has been to minimise or totally abolish administrative hurdles.  Theadded emphasis in the last few years has been a gradual and measured opening up ofoutflows by residents e.g.:Resident individuals can now get upto $ 500 without filling any form or submission ofany documents.  Remittance of foreign exchange for medical treatment upto $ 50,000 isalso without submission of any docouments. Remittance of foreign exchange for traveland education or gifting of funds upto  $ 5000 had already been freed.  Individualprofessionals can now retain upto 100% of his foreign exchange earning in EEFCaccounts.To the NRIs we have sent a strong and unequivocal signal and thereby to the world atlarge about our commitment to convertibility- Repatriable status accorded to all non-resident depositors except balances in NROaccounts.- Capital transfers for NRIs upto $ 1,00,000 out of sale of immovable property asalso inheritances and legacies, permitted.6- Even for balances in NRO accounts greater freedom for repatriation of balancesfor medical treatment, studies, etc.For exporters, suffice it to say, that it is a continuous process of rationalisation ofprocedures, with a view to minimising transaction costs, and to ensure easier and cheaperavailability of credit.To increase the competitiveness of the Indian corporates, limits for Indian directinvestments under the automatic route has been doubled to US$ 100 million.      - Software exporters are encouraged by permitting them to receive 25% of the  valueof their exports in the form of equity of start-up companies.Two-way fungibility of ADRs/GDRs were operationalised to bring about alignment inthe prices of Indian stocks in the domestic vis-à-vis international markets.Corporates have also been accorded greater freedom to raise (upto $ 50 million) andprepay foreign currency borrowings (upto US$ 100 million).- Corporates have also been accorded greater freedom to raise short-termsuppliers/buyers credit for imports (up to US$ 20 million).- An even greater relief to corporates and banks alike is the relaxation in thesubmission of exchange control copy of Bills of Entry  for imports upto US$25,000.- The freedom of FIIs in the Indian financial market has been substantiallyincreased and they are allowed to trade in exchange traded derivatives.Alongside, liberalisation has also been effected in the foreign exchange market.  Forinstance, the freedom to rebook cancelled contracts has been restored, so also booking ofcontracts based on past performance.  Swap and open position limits available to bankshave been enhanced to enable banks to offer finer rates to the customers.RBI is also actively considering introducing rupee based currency options. A Committeeconstituted to look into various related aspects is expected to submit its recommendationsto the Reserve Bank very soon. I also understand that the Forex association has aptly7arranged a panel discussion on this subject tomorrow. I hope that my colleagues who willbe participating in the discussions will carry back several useful suggestions on thesubject.The issue of capital account convertibility also leads me to the current spate of debatesand opinions in respect of the level and cost of reserves. Should countries hold largerreserves or less reserves? Countries need to set their reserves holding on the basis ofcapital as well as current account variables. Apart from the computable charge on thereserves arising out of commitments relating to capital account transactions both long andshort term, as well as trade requirement, the impact of external and internal shocks haveto be kept in view in formulating policy on reserves. As the capital account becomesmore open and international capital flows more readily, the demand for reserves willincrease.  Merely comparing global interest rates with domestic interest rate as a proxyfor cost of reserves may not be appropriate. It is not the arithmetical difference in interestrate on substitutable assets but the various other unquantifiable benefits that the economyderives on account of strong reserves which needs due recognition in such discussions.Two aspects relating to liberalisation need reiteration even at the cost perhaps ofrepetition. First and more important for the fruits of liberalisation to reach the commonman the role of officials at the bank branches is crucial. Our experience based on thefeedback from media reports and the public in this regard is unfortunately not tooencouraging. There is just no purpose in talking about CAC from high podiums if actionat the grass roots level is still embedded in FERA mindsets.  Let me emphasise on oneimportant irritant that a common man is concerned about. He is becoming increasinglyintolerant and sensitive to too much documentation particularly for small valuetransactions. Our efforts in this direction are yet to bear satisfactory results. My messageto you, perhaps the most important one, is, to put in special efforts to ensure hassle freeservice to customers.Second, a more technical one. Recent market developments have underscored theimportance of improved risk management practices in the financial sector. To amplifythis let me recapitulate the exchange rate movements in recent times.   Moving awayfrom pronounced one way movement; the market has started exhibiting fair degree of8two-way movements and finer prices. Unlike the earlier periods when market spreadsnarrowed down faster even at times of volatility the observed pattern of merchant supplyand demand viz. falling supplies with a weakening rupee in anticipation of furtherweakness and shooting up demand due to worry of further weakness and vice versacontinue. The more volatile the currency gets, it is the end-users, rather than theintermediaries, who get hurt in the process. It is therefore disconcerting that the two-waymovements have not resulted in activating risk management strategies among the endusers. Instead, two-way movements have been looked at as opportunities for stayingaway from the market by opposing segments.  Corporates are looking at the treasury as aprofit centre. There is a great deal of work to be done by the banks in widening theawareness of risk management among business entities who are yet to look at the marketas a place for disposal/acquiring currency rather than a place for profit maximisation.  Itis necessary that the business entities do not look at exchange rate movements as anexclusive source for profit enhancement of the business.   Corporates must appreciate therisks involved.  RBI has cautioned banks extending foreign currency loans about the needfor assessing the market risk in their clientele books arising out of unhedged currencyrisks. There is a convincing need for banks and corporates to look at the business balancesheets and identify the sources of market risk, implicit and explicit, and mange itmeaningfully in tune with the business objectives of corporates.Another aspect that needs to be given serious thought is the invoicing of trade. Themarket seems to be very much focussed on the USD -Re rate and the opportunityavailable in other currencies appears to have been completely over looked.  The invoicingpattern of trade reveals that USD continues to be the major currency of invoice. RBIcommunicates with the market in the language of   USD–Re. The stability of Rupeeagainst USD does not mean that Re is equally stable against all the othercurrencies.Though it is not the intention to discuss invoicing strategy here it is necessarythat the end users look at the global currency movements  and effectively use therelaxation permitted to evolve appropriate risk management strategies.The increasingintegration of the economy with the global markets may bring about change in thecurrency composition of trade.  Recognising this possibility in the long run Governmentof India recently permitted RBI to use Euro as another currency for intervention.9In the context of the market one of the other issues is transparency in rate quotations.Electronic trading platforms are taking over the role of brokers and gradually the volumesthrough these platforms are increasing in the global markets. With an outright offer andbid price and volume available price discovery has become superior.  India cannot beaway from the developments and I am sure this development would gain further groundin the times ahead.The recent development in the context of capital markets transactions, relaxing severalregulations are an indicator of the emerging trend.  The country is committed to a gradualand well calibrated move to capital account convertibility.  Convertibility is not a one-time affair; it is a process of evolution and the process is an on-going one.  As we movetowards an increased level of convertibility, it must be emphasised that the responsibilityof the end users and the intermediaries becomes significant.  The freedom would bring intwo way capital flows and the impact of these flows must be absorbed in an efficientmanner.  It is necessary that the market develop adequate risk transfer mechanisms,which would provide shock absorption capability in the event of adverse movements. Wehave to move together to develop risk management products beyond the current age-oldproduct viz. the forwards.There is one last aspect I would like to emphasize.  The world has undergone cataclysmicchanges in the last year as matters relating to money laundering        and terrorist fundinghave come to the fore.  We are of the view that banks and financial institutions mustexercise utmost care.  To know your customer is your right and it is your duty to knowthe purpose of remittances.  Some may needle us that these developments areencouraging the control to revert to restrictions.  This is sheer nonsense and I would urgebanks and financial institutions to be totally vigilant.With these observations, I once again thank you for inviting me for this Assembly andwish your deliberations all success.I am thankful to S/Shri P.Krishnamurthy and G.Padmanabhan, General Managers, Reserve Bank of Indiafor the inputs provided.
