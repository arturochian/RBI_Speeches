Human Development and State Finances: Some Thoughts*Shyamala GopinathIt gives me great pleasure to be here on the occasion of the first programme on"Human Development and State Finances" being jointly organised by the UNDP and theRBI with the support of the Planning Commission.  The UNDP, ever since its inception in1965, and the other UN organisations before that, have been actively involved in thedevelopment priorities of developing countries like ours over the last five decades.  Theyhave gained insights and understanding of our economy and polity which willsubstantially help in achieving our goals of growth with equity, dignified life for all ourpeople and in our pursuit of reforms with a human face.As all of us are well aware, the Government of India is irrevocably andunequivocally committed to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).In fact, the progress that will be achieved by India, home to about one sixth of the world'spopulation, will take the entire mankind much nearer to the MDG.  This is because Indiaaccounts for significant proportions of the under privileged and marginised sections ofthe world with almost one third of the global rural poor living in India.  Yet, our economyis poised at a point of take off, where our achievements can be accelerated.  I believethat we have reached a stage in our development process, wherein we have gatheredcritical momentum to achieve far more in the next 10-15 years than we have done in thelast 55 years.What have been the contours of Human Development? What have been ourachievements in India? How is State finance related to it? Let me in the present addresslook into some of these questions.Contours of Human DevelopmentLet me begin with a brief look at the concept of Human Development.  Whiledoing so, I have a confession to make. I am no expert of the vast discipline concerninghuman development. Nevertheless, as a common citizen I believe that issues relating tohuman development concern us all. Hence, with some trepidation I approach the issue.How do we measure the well being of an individual or group of individuals? It iswidely accepted that a uni-dimensional measure of income does not capture the variousdimensions of personal welfare or happiness.  The weaknesses in the income indicators                                                *Speech by Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India at the Programme on HumanDevelopment and State Finances (jointly organised by the Reserve Bank of India and theUNDP) at the College of Agricultural Banking, Pune on April 4, 2005. The assistance of H.R. Khan, C. P. Mohan and Partha Ray in preparation of the speech is gratefullyacknowledged.have led to use of other measures to complement the per capita income.  The quest forother approaches became necessary to neutralise the information distortions in theincome measure.One of the approaches has been the Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) whichcombines three indicators, viz. adult literacy rate, infant mortality and life expectancy.Another approach is the ‘basic needs approach’ which moves from the philosophy ofmaximising output to minimising poverty.  It argues that the basic needs of adequatenutrition, primary education, health, sanitation, water supply and housing should beavailable to the poorest to a reasonable extent.  The Human Development Index (HDI)approach is the third and most widely used index.The credit for popularising the Human Development approach mainly lies at thedoor of the visionary economist, Mahbub Ul Haq.  His quest to find ways and means ofenhancing the quality of life people experience in the miserable world led to the eventualevolution of the HDI as a composite measure of development. Nobel Laureate ProfessorAmartya Sen awarded for his work in welfare economics, a close friend of Mahbub UlHaq, is renowned for his contributions to the concept of Human Development. ProfessorSen’s work is embedded in his enquiries into social choice, distribution and poverty.  TheHDI is a composite index measuring these basic dimensions of human development,such as, a) long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy at birth), b) knowledge (asmeasured by adult literacy rate, and the combined gross enrolment ratio for primary,secondary and tertiary schools), and c) decent standard of living [as measured by GDPper capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) in terms of US Dollars].The UNDP's discourse, based on the above, focus on the broader attributes ofhuman well-being.  It has defined human development as a process of enlargingpeople's choices as well as raising the level of well being.  In our country, we haveprepared the National Human Development Report by capturing the process ofdevelopment and well being of people from two perspectives, the “ conglomerative”perspective, which takes into account advances made by the society as a whole andthe “deprivational” perspective which assesses the status of the deprived in a society.  Itis believed that both these perspectives should be measured and assessed toadequately understand the process of development.  Hence, the National HumanDevelopment Report (NHDR) of the Planning Commission uses indicators that extendbeyond those of economic, educational and health attainments.  The NHDR measuresindicators,  such as, infant mortality rate, life expectancy, formal education, literacy,availability of pucca house, safe water, level of poverty and per capita expenditure. I amaware of the efforts on the part of various State governments to come up with State-specific Human Development Reports.The task is not easy. In the Nobel lecture delivered on December 8, 1998,Professor Sen articulated the intricacies or the inscrutable involved in any measurementof human welfare when he sought rational explanations to questions like:• How do we judge how well a society as a whole is doing in the light of thedisparate interests of different members?• How do we measure aggregate poverty in view of varying predicaments andmiseries of the diverse people that make up the society?• How can we accommodate the rights and liberties of   persons while givingadequate recognition to their preferences?These are difficult questions to which we do not have ready-made answers, butthese questions eloquently speak of the difficulties in achieving all-round development ofthe society.India’s performance in Human DevelopmentWe, in India, have done remarkably well in many areas of human development.On the social front, we have seen increase in our primary school enrolments, includingfor girls, which was a major concern.  There has been secular and universal reduction inour infant and child mortality rates.  Life expectancy has shown significant upwardchange. The life expectancy at birth that was abysmally low at below 40 years in 1951increased to 63.9 years for males and 66.9 years for females. Similar upward trends arenoticeable in indicators like literacy or access to clean drinking water. All these haveculminated in an improvement in human development. As per the National HumanDevelopment Report, 2001 the combined HDI value has improved from 0.302 in 1981 to0.381 in 1991 and further to 0.472 in 2001. Indications are that this uptrend has beencontinued in the recent years as well.Yet, concerns remain. As per the UNDP’s Human Development Report 2004,India ranked 127 in HDI in 2002 out of 177 countries and the rank for GenderDevelopment Index has been 133.  The inequities in our socio-cultural fabric are stillquite stark. Quality of maternal health is another area that needs to be addressed.  Childhealth is certainly not what it ought to be.  Many children suffer from anaemia, indicativeof pervasive under nourishment.  Severe malnutrition has been reported in severalStates.  Despite having fairly  comfortable level of food  availability, food security for allremains  elusive, particularly for  the vulnerable sections of  population who have poorlivelihood  access   or  have livelihood  susceptible to natural disasters. Gender biascontinues to haunt progress as millions of girl children are kept away from highereducation.  Demographic analysis continues to show that scheduled castes and tribeshave lagged compared to the general category population in education and health.An important issue in this context is volatility of agricultural output in India. Indianagriculture is tested time and again by the harsh realities of the weather.  Repeateddroughts wreck havoc with more than 60 per cent of our almost 150 million farm basedhouseholds who have no access to water other than rains. The basic principle of watermanagement is to conserve water where it falls.  Sporadic but monumental success hasbeen achieved by small communities in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, TamilNadu, etc.  Ralegaon Siddhi near here is one shining example.  Much more remains tobe done.Another issue is the diverse performance of the States as per various indicatorsof development. Among the  parameters indicating human development, States that dowell on one may not be doing so well in another.  For example, while Kerala hasachieved very high levels of social development like literacy, sex ratio, health, or highereducation, it has not done so well in per capita income.  Punjab, on the other hand, hasthe highest per capita income  but has the worst sex ratio in the country.High regional disparity in HDI across States is also a source of concern.Nevertheless, analysis of State-level HDIs by the Planning Commission indicated adecline in such regional disparity during the last two decades.What do we aim for the future? It is instructive to turn to a select set of targets forthe Tenth Plan:• Reduction of poverty ratio by 5 percentage points by 2007 and by 15percentage points by 2012;  • All children in school by 2003;• Reduction in gender gaps in literacy and wage rates by at least 50 per cent by2007;• Increase in Literacy Rates to 75 per cent within the Tenth Plan period (2002-03to 2006-07);• Reduction of Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) to 45 per 1000 live births by 2007 and to28 by 2012;• Reduction of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) to 2 per 1000 live births by 2007and to 1 by 2012;• All villages to have sustained access to potable drinking water within the Planperiod;I am sure that these goals, on implementation, are going to make significantdifference to the lives of millions in India.As you are aware, Government of India has launched major efforts to realisethese  goals. Health is paramount to good living.  The National Rural Health Mission(NRHM) with focus on grass root level public health interventions based on communityownership has been announced for roll out in 2005-06.  The budget for the Departmentof Health and the Department of Family Welfare has  been  increased  by 22 %  toRs.10,280 crore  in 2005-06.  In the all important  sector of education the  Governmenthas  responded  to the needs  by allocating Rs.4,754 crore  for the  Sarva ShikshaAbhiyan programme which  is the cornerstone of the Government’s intervention in basiceducation for all children. This  constitute an  increase  of 55% over 2004-05. A non-lapsable fund called “Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh” has been created for funding thisprogramme  with increased allocation of  Rs.7,156 crore in 2005-06. The National Foodfor Work programme which  was launched in November 2004, is  being supported withan overall  allocation of Rs.11,000 crore.  The Government has proposed to convert thisprogramme into the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme which, when fullyrolled out, will provide livelihood security to crores of poor families.State Finance and Human DevelopmentThe above enumeration of the goals of human development clearly points out tothe necessity of funds for achieving higher quality of life. Interestingly, many of theconstituents of such a package, are in the domain of the State Governments. It is herethat that State finance and human development develops a strong bondage.What has been the state of the States’ finances in recent years? The EconomicSurvey, 2004-05 pointed out that the deterioration in the finances of State Governmentshas been sharper than that of the Central Government. All the major fiscal indicatorsreveal a worsening of the fiscal situation as compared with the position obtaining in1990-91. Fiscal deficit of States as a proportion of GDP increased from 3.3 per cent in1990-91 to  5.1 per cent in the revised estimates for 2003 – 04 . Revenue deficit toowitnessed a sharper rise to 2.6 percent of the GDP as per the revised estimates for2003-04. The factors responsible for such a deterioration are many and include factors,such as, growing burden of: a) interest payments, b) pension liabilities, and c)administrative expenditure, mounting losses of State owned public enterprises,inappropriate user charges, increased  contingent liabilities and deceleration in Centraltransfers.Such fiscal stress seriously erodes the States’ capability to discharge itsparamount responsibility for developing social and economic infrastructure.   It hasincreasingly been recognised that it is the State finances where the government sector’sinterface with the people is the maximum. Hence, fiscal consolidation and progressiveimplementation of fiscal and institutional reforms by the States will have a direct bearingon the quality of life of people.   The RBI on its own part have taken several initiatives tocreate awareness about the urgent need for fiscal correction by the States and initiatedmany measures, such as, advising States to set  up Consolidated Sinking Fund for debtservicing, constitution of Guarantee Redemption Fund  to meet guarantee obligations,sensitising them towards the fiscal  risk arising out of guarantees extended by Statesbesides undertaking several studies and preparing  reports, mainly through the forum ofState Finance Secretaries on important fiscal issues like pension liabilities, fiscalresponsibility legislation, restructuring of the State  level enterprises, etc.It is, however, heartening to note in this regard that a number of States havebeen making serious endeavours to carry forward the fiscal reform process and haveeither enacted the Fiscal Responsibility Act or are in the process of doing so, particularlyafter the recent publication of the report of the State Finance Secretaries’ Group onModel Fiscal Responsibility Legislation at the State level. In a major shift in approach,the 12th Finance Commission has linked the enactment of the Fiscal ResponsibilityLegislation as a precondition for debt relief. This has assumed significance at the macrolevel as large deficits at the State level can cause distortions to the overall fiscaldiscipline in the country. The 12th Finance Commission has also provided aframework for substantial increase in Central devolutions and transfers to states. Thiswould result in beneficial impact on revenue account. More grants-in-aid will also beavailable for expenditure in the social sectors which will be an additionality over thenormal expenditure by the States in these sectors.Availability of resources alone cannot generate social sector development.  It isin this context that the Finance Minister in his Budget speech has distinguished betweenthe outlay and the outcome.  A major element would be the development of properinstitutions. NGOs or local self government like Panchayati Raj have a lot to do with theattainment of outcome in the social sector development.  The lowest sub-Stateadministrative level in the country is the district  which plays a critical role in theoutcomes of the government programmes and interventions.  Large number ofmonitoring studies, evaluations, and research have found that the outcomes have largevariations across States and even across districts in the same State.  It is here that theparticipants of this programme do have an extremely significant role.Concluding ObservationsI am glad that the first among this series of programmes is being attended mostlyby the officials from the State Governments.  You are the people who remain at the levelof implementation and, thus, are at the cutting edge of societal transformation. Inconclusion, it is to be realised that the onus of practicing such principles for enhancinghuman development lies on all of us, while the nation is waiting and, may I add,impatiently.Let me end by quoting from one of the last notes left behind by Mahatma Gandhiin 1948 :“Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much withyou, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and theweakest man whom you have seen, and ask yourself, if the step youcontemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it?Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny? In otherwords, will it lead to freedom for the hungry and spiritually starvingmillions? Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away.”*****
