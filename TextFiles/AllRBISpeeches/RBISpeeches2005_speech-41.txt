Foreign Exchange Regulatory Regimes in India:From Control to Management*Shyamala GopinathShri Minoo Shroff, Mr Gazaria, Mr. Thakkar, ladies and gentlemen.I am delighted to be here in Forum of Free Enterprise to deliver thekeynote address at this programme on FEMA for executives andprofessionals. The Forum of Free Enterprise has been engaged ineducating public focusing special attention on the youth with a view tohelping today’s younger generation to become good, responsible, activeand well informed citizens of tomorrow. Towards that end stalwarts likethe late A.D. Shroff, the late Murarji J. Vaidya, the late Nani Palkhiwalaand the late M. R. Pai had played a great role.In my address, I would like to set out the rationale of theliberalisation and simplification of process and procedures for foreignexchange transactions. What has been the philosophy behind India’spolicies in regard to the external sector? What are the current challengesfor India as it integrates with the global economy? What has been thepolicy measures taken for simplification and liberalisation of process andprocedures for foreign exchange transactions? In the present address Iintend to cover some of these questions.Context of Foreign Exchange RegulationsThere is a German word called z eit-geist which, I am told, canbroadly be translated as the ‘spirit of time’. Nothing better describes theevolution of foreign exchange regulation in India. Let me start with a briefbrush of history. Soon after independence, a complex web of controlswere imposed for all external transactions through a legislation i.e.,Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1947. These were put into a                                                * Address by Deputy Governor at the Conference organized by the Forum for Free Enterprise at Mumbaion January 25, 2005. The assistance of S/Shri H. Bhattacharya, Vinay Baijal, Deepak Kumar, and ParthaRay in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged.more rigorous framework of controls through FERA, 1973.  Severerestrictions on current account transactions had continued till mid-1990swhen relaxations were made in the operations of the FERA, 1973. Thecontrol framework was essentially transaction based in terms of which alltransactions in foreign exchange including those between residents andnon-residents were prohibited, unless specifically permitted.Control- to- Management: FERA-to-FEMAIn the 1990s, consistent with the general philosophy of economicreforms a sea change relating to the broad approach to reform in theexternal sector took place. The Report of the High Level Committee onBalance of Payments (Chairman: Dr. C. Rangarajan, 1993) set the broadagenda in this regard. The Committee recommended, inter alia,  theintroduction of a market-determined exchange rate regime within limits;liberalisation of current account transactions leading to current accountconvertibility; compositional shift in capital flows away from debt to nondebt creating flows; strict regulation of external commercial borrowings,especially short-term debt; discouraging volatile elements of flows fromnon-resident Indians; full freedom for outflows associated with inflows(i.e., principal, interest, dividend, profit and sale proceeds) and gradualliberalisation of other outflows; and dissociation of Government in theintermediation of flow of external assistance, as in the 1980s, receipts oncapital account and external financing were confined to externalassistance through multilateral and bilateral sources.The sequence of events in the subsequent years generallyfollowed these recommendations. In 1993, exchange rate of rupee wasmade market determined; close on the heels of this important step, Indiaaccepted Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the InternationalMonetary Fund in August 1994 and adopted the current accountconvertibility. In June 2000 a legal framework, with implementation ofFEMA, has also been put into effect to ensure convertibility on the2current account. As emphasized by the Rangarajan Committee that therecould be capital outflows from residents in the guise of current accounttransactions after current account convertibility, certain safeguards werealso built into the system after FEMA came into effect. For example:• First, the requirement of repatriation and surrender of exportproceeds was continued, with provision of Exchange EarnersForeign Currency (EEFC) account for use by exchange earners.• Second, all authorized dealers were allowed to sell foreignexchange for underlying current account transactions supported bydocumentary evidence.• Third, a proactive approach in the development of money,government securities and forex markets has been adopted.• Fourth, effort has been made to improve the information base ontransactions in the forex markets with respect to its nature andmagnitude through reports and statements. The insistence onadequate and timely reporting requirements from authoriseddealers for various foreign exchange transactions also helped insimplification and liberalisation process.• Fifth, as a general rule, genuine hedging of exposures underspecified conditions is allowed.This consistent approach has lent credibility to the liberalisationprocess of both current and capital account transactions.In 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility(CAC), constituted by the Reserve Bank, had indicated the preconditionsfor Capital Account Convertibility. The three crucial preconditions werefiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target and, strengthening of thefinancial system. Drawing from the lessons of international experience,the Committee noted that, in general, countries which initiated the moveto CAC on the basis of strong fundamentals were able to modulate thepace of instituting CAC without undertaking large and dramatic shifts inthe stance of macro economic policies. Furthermore, these countries3were less vulnerable to backtracking and the reimposition of controls inthe face of exogenous shocks. In fact, the pursuit of reforms in otherareas by these countries instilled confidence in the process of opening upof the capital account. Countries with weak initial conditions have toadopt drastic measures in macro economic policies to facilitate the moveto CAC. Some of these countries had to face interruptions andreintroduction of capital controls in the evolution of CAC. In this context, Irecall the observations of former Governor, Dr. Bimal Jalan and I quote,“...It must be understood that merely by lifting all capital controls, themarkets of a developing country do not get as deeply integrated as adeveloped country’s markets.  As such, each country would need todecide on its own path of capital account liberalization with regard to thetiming and sequencing”.The Tarapore Committee had also recommended change in thelegislative framework governing foreign exchange transactions.Accordingly, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) which formedthe statutory basis for exchange control in India was repealed andreplaced by the new Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) witheffect from June 2000. The philosophical approach has shifted from thatof conservation of foreign exchange to one of facilitating trade andpayments as well as developing orderly foreign exchange market.  Thisdefinitive shift in the objectives of foreign exchange management couldbe seen in the preamble to the new legislation.FEMA provided a de jure status to the shift in the policies withregard to the external sector reforms that began in 1990-91. Further andmore importantly, FEMA has diluted the rigorous enforcement provisionswhich were the hallmark of the erstwhile legislation.  Unlike in FERA, theprosecution has to prove the guilt of the accused person. Further,   underFEMA only monetary penalty are provided for contraventions. Thecategorisation of offences under FEMA as civil and not criminalconstitutes one of the most important differences between the two4statutes. Contravention of FEMA provisions are dealt with under civil lawprocedures, for which separate administrative procedure and mechanismin the form of Compounding Rules, Adjudicating Authority, SpecialDirector (Appeals) and Appellate Tribunal have been established.Another significant change has been that for each process of law a time-frame has been provided in the Act. For example, the process ofcompounding is required to be completed within 180 days.The concept of compounding in FEMA is another distinguishingfeature, especially from the perspective of customers. Under FERA, allviolations were subject to separate investigation and adjudication of theDirectorate of Enforcement. However, FEMA provides for an opportunityof seeking compounding of contraventions, in terms of which acontravener has a suo moto opportunity of making an application to thecompounding authority seeking the contravention to be compounded.The compounding authority is required under the Act to dispose of theapplication within 180 days. The Government of India, in one of its recentNotifications, has designated the Reserve Bank as the compoundingauthority for all contraventions, except for those involving hawalatransactions for which the Directorate of Enforcement would be thecompounding authority. The Reserve Bank is in the process of issuingthe necessary direction for implementation of the process forcompounding of contravention under FEMA. I am sure the newprocedure will go a long way in providing a quick and hassle-freedisposal of cases involving contravention(s) of FEMA.Having delineated the context let me now turn to specifics ofcapital account liberalisation and the accompanying challenges.Capital Account Liberalization ApproachGlobalization of the world economy is a reality that makes openingup of the capital account and integration with global economy anunavoidable process. Today capital account liberalization is not a choice.5Governor, Dr. Reddy once commented that, “capital accountliberalisation is a process and it has to be managed keeping in view theelasticity in the economy, and vulnerabilities or potential for shocks.These include fiscal, financial, external, and even real sector say, oil1prices and monsoon conditions for India.”The capital account liberalization primarily aims at liberalizingcontrols that hinder the international integration and diversification ofdomestic savings in a portfolio of home assets and foreign assets andallows agents to reap the advantages of diversification of assets in thefinancial and real sector. However, the benefits of capital mobility comewith certain risks which should be categorized and managed through acombination of administrative measures, gradual opening up ofprudential restrictions and safeguards to contain these risks.The discussion on capital flows and monetary policy inevitablybegins with the well-known “trilemma” or the impossible trinity in thesense that a country can choose no more than two of the following threefeatures of its policy regime: (1) free capital mobility across borders, (2) afixed exchange rate, and (3) an independent monetary policy. Variouscombinations of these features have dominated world monetaryarrangements in different eras. The question of how developing andemerging-market countries like ours should resolve the trilemma is verycrucial. At best a medium-term goal of achieving free capital mobilitycould be set with measured steps and optimal control.Recent Policy initiativesIndia adopted a gradualist approach while initiating a process ofgradual capital account liberalisation in the early 1990s and treated it asa process rather than an event. In recent past, there has seen significantchanges in the external sector policy of the Reserve Bank. TheDepartment concerned of the Reserve Bank has been rechristened from                                                1  Remarks on Capital Account Liberlisation and capital controls by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, Central6the Exchange Control Department to Foreign Exchange Department,highlighting the change in the intent and content of the policy framework.Let me assure you that this change is not just a matter of semantics butis reflective of the changed mind-set. The focus of the measures hasbeen to dismantle controls and provide an enabling environment to allentities engaged in external transactions. The current approach toliberalisation has been characterized by greater transparency, datamonitoring and information dissemination and to move away from micro-management of foreign exchange transactions to macro management offorex flows and forex market. The emphasis of the Reserve Bank hasbeen to ensure that procedural formalities are minimised so thatexporters and others are able to concentrate on their core activity ratherthan engaging in avoidable paper work, while ensuring observance ofKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) guidelines. The details of the various initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank willbe discussed later by other speakers. Let me, for the sake ofcompleteness, present a quick run-down of the significant policymeasures in this context:Investment OverseasTo further the process of capital account liberalisation, steps weretaken to encourage the strategic presence of the Indian corporatesoverseas.  Overseas investment are also permitted for undertakingagricultural activities including purchase of land incidental to this activityeither directly or through the overseas offices. These measures wouldenable the Indian companies to take advantage of global opportunitiesand also acquire technological and other skills for their adoption in India.Indian companies are now free to invest upto their net worth outside Indiawithout any ceiling.                                                                                                                                             Bank Governors' Symposium, 2004, Bank of England, June 25, 2004.7External Commercial BorrowingKeeping in view India’s external sector position, as reflected incountry’s various external debt sustainability indicators, a comprehensivereview of the ECB guidelines was carried out in consultation with theGovernment and revised ECB guidelines, effective February 1, 2004,were announced to encourage corporates to access ECB for undertakingreal investment activity in India and for overseas direct investment in JVsand Wholly Owned Subsidiary (WOS). The maximum amount of ECBthat can be accessed under the Automatic Route is enhanced to USD500 million (from USD 50 million previously) per financial year. Further,transparency in policy implementation is evident from the fact that theReserve Bank now posts data of all ECB raised, both through theautomatic route and the approval route in the public domain on itswebsite for information of all concerned. The thrust of the new policy is toencourage investment in the real sector including infrastructure, whilerestricting debt flows for purposes other than those adding to thecountry’s capital stock. Higher amount can be accessed with priorapproval of the RBI.Foreign Direct Investment: The FDI policy followed has been toencourage investment in manufacturing and infrastructure. A personresident outside India or an incorporated entity outside India can investeither with the specific prior approval of the Government of India (12activities), or under the Automatic route (21 activities). There are 11activities in which investment is not permissible. Investment underautomatic route is permissible without approval of the Government or theReserve Bank subject to the prescribed sectoral cap.Portfolio Investment: Foreign Institutional Investors ( FIIs)registered with SEBI and Non-resident Indians are eligible to purchaseshares and convertible debentures under the Portfolio InvestmentScheme subject to certain limits.8ADR / GDR:An Indian corporate can raise foreign currencyresources abroad through the issue of American Depository Receipts(ADRs) or Global Depository Receipts ( GDRs) subject to certainconditions. Two-way fungibility of ADRs/GDRs was operationalised tobring about alignment in the prices of Indian stocks in the domestic vis-à-vis international markets.Non-Resident Deposits: There have been significant changes inthe policy framework for non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits held by theIndian banking system, which constitute a major portion of external debtfor India. The interest rate on the deposits were rationalized and linked tointernational benchmark LIBOR.Liberalised remittance of USD 25,000 p.a. by Resident Individual:In order to provide hassle free remittance facility based on a declarationresident individuals were allowed in early 2004 to remit upto USD 25,000per annum for any permitted purpose both under current and capitalaccount or combination of both.  Resident individuals were also permittedto acquire property overseas and open accounts with banks outsideIndia.Students: Indian students studying abroad are treated as Non-Resident Indians.  As non-residents, they are eligible for all the facilitiesavailable to NRIs, in addition to remittance facilities presently available tostudents as residents.Procedural SimplificationsNo liberalisation effort is complete unless the customers or theend-users of the forex market can access the same through simple andtransparent procedures. A number of initiatives have been taken towardsprocedural simplification with an objective of reducing the transactioncost. In the case of individuals, foreign exchange for current accounttransactions such as education, medical, travel, emigration, maintenanceof close relatives abroad can be drawn from the Authorised dealer based9on simple declaration up to certain indicated limits. Having regard to theliberalised approach in trade matters, specific steps were taken to allowexporters greater flexibility and freedom in the matter of seekingregulatory compliances.   The system of self write off and self extensionof due date for export realisation for exporters was introduced followedby raising the threshold limit for GR declaration.  Similarly, thesimplifications of procedures for import remittances have also beenintroduced. Overall, measures for simplification of procedures have beenmade subject to KYC and Anti Money Laundering guidelines.In keeping with its commitment to ensure hassle-free service to thecustomers the Reserve Bank has constituted the Committee onProcedures and Performance Audit on Public Services (CPPAPS)(Chairman: Shri S.S. Tarapore) in December 2003 to address thedifficulties faced by common persons in getting services from the bankingsector. The Reserve Bank also advised banks to constitute an adhoccommittee in each of them to review the procedure followed by them andto ensure that the instructions issued by the Reserve Bank are properlyimplemented. The CPPAPS, in its Report No.1 on Exchange Controlsrelating to the Individuals, focused its attention on the assessment offacilities and procedures for both residents and non-resident individuals.The recommendations of the CPPAPS have been examined by theReserve Bank and a number of steps had already been taken for theirimplementation, securing procedural simplification. Further, measureshave been initiated to institutionalise the system for proceduralsimplification in respect of foreign exchange transactions both at the levelof the Reserve Bank and authorised dealers.In recent years, the Reserve Bank has delegated authorities toauthorised dealers to such an extent that there is hardly any need for theindividuals to approach the Reserve Bank for any approval. However, wehave come across instances where the liberalised procedures have notpermeated to the grassroot level in banks possibly due to lack of10knowledge about various rules and regulations and also procedures to befollowed for various types of forex transactions. While, we at the ReserveBank would continue our efforts to improve the customer servicerendered at the Reserve Bank and banks, I request that any difficulties ingetting facilities which are permissible may be brought to the notice of theReserve Bank.Way AheadIndia’s capital account liberalisation measures have been largelyeffective. Among other factors, suitable policy measures in respect of theexternal sector insulated India from the 1997 Asian crisis. We havemoved forward gradually towards Capital Account Convertibility with abroad reform agenda that encompasses trade, competition, reform of thefinancial system and industrial restructuring.As evident from various economic indicators, the liberalisationprocess that has been underway for some time created a morecompetitive environment for Indian industry vis-à-vis what existed earlier.Consequently, the Indian companies have upgraded their technology andexpanded to more efficient scales of production and refocused theiractivities to areas of competence. Increasingly, Indian companies arelooking to become global players.  Reform measures in the externalsector, including dismantling of exchange control have been a contributorto this development.We would continue to participate actively in the process ofeconomic and financial globalisation, accelerate domestic economicreform and continue with our firm commitment to liberalisation so as toserve the needs of economic growth and development of the country. Anincreasingly liberalising foreign exchange regulatory regime will be anessential ingredient to this vision.Thank You.****11
