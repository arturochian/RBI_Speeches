Ithought that it would be appropriate today to revisit the subject in the year 2000 –Bretton Woods, a place in New Hampshire in the U.S.A. became famous soonafter the Second World War when a Conference was held there.

Therehave been significant changes in their role and functioning since Dr. Krishna dealt withthe subject in 1946 and a quote from Mr. M. Narasimham’s A.D.

Substantive negotiations wereessentially between the U.K. and the U.S.A., and thus between their spokesmen, viz.,Lord Keynes and Mr. Harry Dexter White.  The problems and perspectives were thus the post-war era, and the painful memories of the Great Depression.  The majorcontribution of the Conference was the acceptance of the idea that the internationalmonetary system has to operate within a framework of cooperation and consultationamong Governments.  It also accepted the idea of a provision of resources to a countrythe basis for the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  It also the need for transfer of resources from capital surplus to capital deficit countries throughthe intermediation of an official multilateral body, viz., the International Bank forThe basic structural characteristics of BWIs remain somewhat unchanged.Governments are political bodies, and these institutions, which are creatures ofGovernments are bound to be political; and, therefore, their membership and functioningopen only to Governments, is naturally voluntary.  They are cooperative in character,trading strengths.  So, they are akin to cooperatives whose members have unequalstrength.  They are also like clubs, where members are expected to observe certain rulesregarding conduct of economic policy, within a mutually acceptable framework whichMembers are permitted to draw resources from each of the institutions, subject toform of a loan repayable along with some interest or fees.

The Bretton Woods were thus functioning for over thirty years claiming to be world bodies withoutmembership of the large socialist bloc.  The ‘eighties, however, saw active participationof China which got its rightful place, while the ‘nineties brought Russia into itsmembership.  In brief, these institutions are more representative of the world economyDuring their history of over fifty years, there have been both institutionalinnovations and a changing focus to meet the dynamics of global economy.  Thus, which initially assisted war-torn economies, such as Japan and France soon left this taskto the U.S.A. under the Marshall Plan and concentrated on developing countries.Originally envisaged to provide only project-specific loans, IBRD shifted its focus toprogramme-lending, structural adjustment, and more recently, to policy lending.  Fromcommercially viable projects, the focus shifted to social sectors, then to poverty-relatedissues and more recently to governance issues as well as to institutional development.Efforts of IBRD were supplemented by Regional Banks (like Asian Development Bank,In the IBRD, only a part of the subscribed capital is paid-in by member countriesand the rest is callable. The members do not claim dividends on profits. The bulk oflendable resources of IBRD are by borrowings from capital markets and hence, IBRDcan, in turn, lend only to those countries, which are considered creditworthy.  Thisimplied that many poorer countries were not eligible, in the sense that any loans to themfrom the IBRD would have adversely affected the quantum and rate at which the IBRDcould raise its lendable resources from the capital markets. In these circumstances,International Development Association (IDA), an affiliate of the IBRD, was established,consisting of contributions in the form of grants from the Governments of developedavailable to the IDA.  Another body, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) wasalso sponsored as an affiliate of the World Bank, specialising in providing finance to theprivate sector. Membership of the affiliates is, by and large, common to that of the IBRDand these institutions together constitute the World Bank Group.  A more recent additionSince 1999, the emphasis of the World Bank group is on the ComprehensiveDevelopment Framework (CDF). The CDF aims at suggesting a holistic approach todevelopment that recognises the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals and yetassigns equal weight to the institutional, structural and social underpinnings of a robustsector and other developmental actors is emphasised in the CDF.

It is evident that the WorldSimilarly, the IMF has also been attempting to adapt itself to changing needs.Under the original Bretton Woods exchange rate regime, each country would set a fixedvalue – called par value of its currency in terms of gold or the U.S. Dollar.  The parvalues of two currencies determined the official exchange rate (also called parity)from a country’s own reserves and if necessary by loans (technically termed aspurchases) from the IMF, any fundamental balance of payments problems were to becorrected by exchange rate changes.  This system ran into problems in the ‘sixties, sincefixed exchange rate regime constrained monetary policy in most developed countries.Due to difficulties faced in gold supplies and doubts on the role of U.S. dollar as areserve asset, the IMF agreed to create Special Drawing Rights (SDR).  In 1971, USAclosed its gold window and this led to floating rate regimes in many countries, replacinggold and par value systems that were bedrocks of the original IMF.  Due to severalThe IMF responded to several challenges to international monetary order with aseries of facilities such as Compensatory and Contingency Financial Facility (1963),facilities for poor countries under Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (1999).  In thecontext of debt crises of Latin America in the early ‘eighties, IMF emerged as a majorIn 1995, the IMF arranged a $40 billion rescue package for Mexico at theinitiative of the USA.  The IMF’s role and capacities were severely tested in the mostrecent crisis-episodes, viz. ,  East Asian, Russian and Brazilian crisis and herein lies themost serious provocation in their history for a thorough review of Bretton WoodsIt is worth noting here that until the ‘nineties, problems in a country’s balance ofpayments were, barring shocks, essentially a consequence of what could be termed asinappropriate policies of the Governments in the countries concerned.  The Asian crisis,however, highlighted a new dimension to the problem.  The Asian crisis was largelyattributable to failures in the private sector – both in the recipient as well as lendingcountries.  This new dimension is an important element in the set of factors that haveIt would be inappropriate to conclude that the BWIs have been successful in allin that light without prejudice to improving their functioning or even evolving parallel or5significant mechanisms for multilateral cooperation and have to be continuously assessedto the global challenges or to the problems of individual countries.

India obtained a quota, which ranked heramong the five largest stake holding members of the Fund and the World Bank. India’sfifth place assumes significance as each of the five largest stake holding is entitled to a‘permanent’ chair in the Executive Board and appoint its own Executive Director. thus enjoyed a permanent seat in the Fund at the time of its inception. However, in theearly ‘seventies, Japan improved its quota and share-holding to rank amongst the fiveIndia’s recourse to the IMF was limited during the period 1945 to the 1980s.Before the First Five-Year Plan, India borrowed a moderate amount of SDR 100 millionunder the lower tranche (generally up to 50 per cent of the quota). During the SecondFive-Year Plan period, to cope up with the problem of balance of payments, an amountequivalent of SDR 200 million was borrowed from the IMF. During the Third Planperiod, India encountered severe balance of payments problem and hence borrowed ahigher amount of SDR 375 million from the Fund. During 1965 and 1968, the balance ofpayments situation worsened and India devalued its currency and sought IMF assistanceto the tune of SDR 415 million including SDR 90 million under the CompensatoryThe next availment of the IMF facility was during 1973-74, when India wasaffected by the first oil shock and hence borrowed SDR 775 million including SDR 200million under the oil facility.

The Commission submitted its Report to theThe Report’s major recommendations are that the IMF should be downsized withunique responsibilities which are that it should be merely a quasi lender of last resort toemerging economies with short maturity loans, collect and publish financial data frommembers and provide advice (but not impose condition) relating to economic policy.Thus, the IMF should be precluded from making other types of loans, especially long-term subsidised loans. The Commission also suggests that the countries should avoidpegged or adjustable exchange rates and this should be a priority given in the Article IVConsultations. The Commission argues that the debt renegotiation practices are evolvingrapidly without official intervention and, therefore, should be left to borrowers andlenders. The Commission recommends that currencies should be divided into G-5IMF is sought to be a stand-by lender and in a crisis the Fund should borrow convertibleUnder the aegi s of G-20, the issue of codes and standards has become animportant area.  Adoption of codes and standards are important for increasingtransparency and for facilitating favourable market perceptions.  A Code of Goodpractices on Fiscal Transparency was approved by the Fund in 1998.  Similarly, a Codeof Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial policies has also beenapproved by the Interim Committee in September 1999.

The maintask of this Committee is to identify and monitor developments in global standards andConsidering that there are a number of codes in a wide variety of areas, theCommittee has identified 10 different subjects, based on their criticality and importanceand constituted an Advisory Group under the chairmanship of eminent personalities.Thus Advisory Groups have been constituted in the area of fiscal transparency,transparency of monetary and financial policies, banking supervision, securities marketregulation, insurance regulation, accounting and auditing, bankruptcy, corporateand compliance in India of the relevant standards and codes, given the prevailing legaland institutional framework.  The Advisory Groups will also compare the levels ofadherence in India vis-à-vis industrialised countries as also emerging economies with aview to understanding India’s position and prioritising actions on some of the moreThe Reports of the Groups will be made available to all concerned in public andIt is clear that the international financial architecture is being revisited on severalfronts and the role of the BWIs as well as the framework of the functioning of the BWIsare integral to this process of review.  There is clearly a consensus, as of now, that nonew bureaucracies or international financial institutions be set up.  There is also aStability Forum and G-20 are prime examples.  The process of international cooperationis no longer confined to fora where only national Governments are involved though theycontinue to be critical.  The operational framework of BWIs is under review and as toIndia is closely involved in these processes as one of the giant economies, with alast instalment amount of about US $ 25 million to the Fund in June, 2000.  In fact, bypursuing appropriate policies, we have been able to repurchase almost all our obligationsin the last seven years.  Besides, during this period, we have built up over $36 billion offoreign exchange reserves while maintaining the external debt almost constant. If themacro policies continue to be sound to ensure progress in desirable directions of17resources of BWIs, India will be repaying the On the limited issue of utilisation of significant interface now with the global financial system.the centre stage.what shape this would take, it is difficult to speculate, but the BWIs will continue to be inconsensus that multiple fora for consultation and cooperation are desirable and, FinancialConclusionprivate sectors.for achieving the best practices.important codes and standards.

The Committee wouldefficiency and stability, I believe there will be no need for us to approach Fund for anyassistance. With a comfortable external sector position, significant reduction in theGovernment’s fiscal deficit should help the Government to phase out its dependence onIDA whose level of resources is getting depleted.  Over the medium-term, it should alsobe possible to earmark all loans from IBRD for utilisation in long gestation butcommercially viable projects such as those in infrastructure, perhaps in quasi-Government sector.  In this background, I could envisage a more active role for India inThe major thrust for policy for the Government in the near future would,therefore, be three-fold.  The first major thrust would be to ensure the continuedimplementation of appropriate macro policies; the second key thrust would be to addresssatisfactorily social issues, such as poverty, primary education, primary health,environmental protection, governance, etc.  The third area of attention would be tobenchmark our institutional and procedural frameworks governing the fiscal, monetary,accounting and regulatory areas with international best practices and aligning ourselveswith them.  The recently established Standing Committee on Codes and the eminentpersons associated with Advisory Groups should help us in the third thrust area but thiswill be of help only if there is matching progress in areas relating to macro policies andTo conclude, the  role in an environment of high proportion of privatecapital flows is likely to be relatively one of catalyst, whereby it renders support andadvice to outside bodies such as G-20 and BIS in respect of evolution of standards andcodes, that do not fall within  core competence.  In this context, the need to clarifythe respective roles of the BWIs in particular and international financial institutions ingeneral becomes essential.
