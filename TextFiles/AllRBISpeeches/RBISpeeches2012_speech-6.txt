·Perspectives on India’s Balance of PaymentsI thank Professor Sar for inviting me to address this young audience. In the recent years,India’s integration with the global economy has increased significantly. This is reflected inour expanding volume of external trade and financial transactions. While this process hasseveral benefits arising from wider access to consumption and investment, there is attendantcost of periodic instability. Over the last two years, the Reserve Bank has been drawingattention to the widening current account deficit (CAD) in our balance of payments (BoP).The risks to our BoP have increased both in the global and domestic context: first, followingthe global financial crisis trade volumes have slumped and capital flows have becomevolatile; second, slowing domestic growth coupled with a large fiscal deficit alongside a highCAD poses twin deficit risks. In this context, I propose to capture the evolution of India’sBoP in the historical context and trace how did we respond to risks to external stability fromtime to time?Let me start from the basics. What is BoP? It is our transaction account with the rest ofthe world. It can be better appreciated in terms of the national income accounting identity:GDP = C+G+I+X-M. In other words, domestic output (GDP) is equal to private consumption(C), plus government consumption (G), plus domestic investment (I), plus net exports (X-M).If net exports of goods and services (X-M) are negative, the domestic economy is absorbingmore than it can produce. In other words, absorption (C+G+I) by the domestic economy isgreater than domestic output (GDP). This is reflected in current account deficit (X-M) whichneeds to be financed by external borrowings and/or investments. In normal times externalfinance may not be a problem. However, it could be challenging if both the global anddomestic economic outlook are not very favourable. Against this background, my scheme ofpresentation will be as follows: identify the key events those shaped India’s BoP sinceindependence; examine the changes in the composition of capital inflows; and in conclusionhighlight a few risks and make some suggestions to reinforce India’s BoP.India’s BoP evolved reflecting both the changes in our development paradigm andexogenous shocks from time to time. In the 60 year span, 1951-52 to 2011-12, six events had· Speech by Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India at the School ofthManagement, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar on 7 December 2012.

I will analyse the BoPtrend in this sequence.The first phase can be considered from the 1950s through mid-1960s. In the early1950s, India was reasonably open. For example, in 1951-52, merchandise trade, exports plusimports, accounted for 16 per cent of GDP. Overall current receipts plus payments werenearly 19 per cent of GDP. Subsequently, the share of external sector in India’s GDPgradually declined with the inward looking policy of import substitution. Moreover, Indianexport basket comprised mainly traditional items like tea, cotton textile and jutemanufactures. Not only the scope of world trade expansion in these commodities was less butadditionally India had to face competition from new emerging suppliers, such as Pakistan injute manufactures and Ceylon and East Africa in tea.During this period, policy emphasis was on import saving rather than export promotion,and priority was given to basic goods and capital goods sector. It was argued that investmentin heavy industries would bring in saving in foreign exchange, as output from such industrieswould replace their imports in the long-run. Import-substituting strategies were expected togradually increase export competitiveness through efficiency-gains achieved in the domesticeconomy. But this did not happen. Hence, exports remained modest. In fact our externalsector contracted in relation to GDP from the level observed in the early 1950s. By 1965-66,merchandise trade was under 8 per cent of GDP and overall current receipts and paymentswere below 10 per cent of GDP (Table 1).Table 1: Trend in External Openness(Percent of GDP) Merchandise Receipts plus Total ReceiptsExports plus Payments plus PaymentsImports (Current (Current andAccount) Capital)1951-52 15.8 18.5 19.71965-66 7.7 9.9 14.11973-74 7.8 12.1 17.81990-91 14.6 19.4 31.51999-00 20.6 31.2 46.82008-09 40.6 60.6 111.62011-12 43.8 61.5 109.62Notwithstanding the contracting size of the external sector, as imports growthoutstripped exports growth, there was persistent current account deficit (CAD). Emphasis onheavy industrialisation in the second five year Plan led to a sharp increase in imports. On topof this, the strains of Indo-China conflict of 1962, Indo-Pakistan war of 1965 and severedrought of 1965-66 triggered a major BoP crisis. India’s international economic relationswith advanced countries came under stress during the Indo-Pak conflict. Withdrawal offoreign aid by countries like the US and conditional resumption of aid by the Aid IndiaConsortium led to contraction in capital inflows. Given the low level of foreign exchangereserves and burgeoning trade deficit, India had no option other than to devalue. Rupee was1devalued by 36.5 per cent in June 1966.Though India’s export basket was limited, the sharp devaluation clearly increased thecompetitiveness of India’s exports. Concurrently, India had to undertake a number of tradeliberalising measures. Even though the net impact of devaluation was a contentious issue2among the leading economists, data show that exports growth, though modest, outpacedimports growth (Chart 1).1Official rate increased from Rs.4.76 per US dollar to Rs.7.50 per US dollar.2 For example, Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1975) argued that the effective devaluation was more forimports than the exports. “Foreign Trade Regimes and Economic Development: India”, NationalBureau of Economic Research, New York.3In fact, the current account turned into a surplus in 1973-74 as not only the exports3growth was significant but invisible receipts also showed a sharp turnaround from deficit tosurplus mainly on account of official transfers which largely represented grants under theagreement of February 1974 with the US Government on the disposition of PL 480 and otherrupee funds. Since surplus in current account balance (CAB) was used for repaying rupeeloans under the same agreement with the US, accretion to reserves was only marginal.Surplus in India’s CAB was, however, short-lived as the first oil shock occurred byOctober 1973. Sharp rise in international oil prices was evident in higher imports growth in1973-74 and 1974-75. The share of crude oil in India's import bill rose from 11 per cent in1972-73 to 26 per cent by 1974-75. As exports improved, particularly to oil producingMiddle-East countries, BoP recovered quickly from the first oil shock. By this time, theIndian rupee, which was linked to a multi-currency basket with pound sterling as interventioncurrency, depreciated against the US dollar (Chart 2).Depreciating rupee along with other policy incentives to exporters acted as asupporting factor for India’s exports. At the same time, invisible receipts grew sharplystemming from workers’ remittances from the Middle East. Consequently, the currentaccount balance turned into surplus in 1976-77 and 1977-78 (Chart 3).3 Comprises services, transfers and income.4Thus, the private transfers added a new positive dimension to India’s BoP after thefirst oil shock. Further, with the official exchange rate nearly converging to market exchangerate, there was not much incentive for routing remittances through unofficial exchangebrokers. The rapid growth of private transfers reinforced the trade account adjustment tomake the current account situation much more comfortable (Chart 4).During the 1980s, BoP again came under stress. The second oil shock led to a rapidincrease in imports in early 1980s. Oil imports increased to about two-fifths of India’simports during 1980-83. At the same time, India’s external sector policy was changing5towards greater openness. Various measures were undertaken to promote exports andliberalise imports for exporters during this period. However, several factors weighed againstexternal stability. First, despite a number of export promotion measures, the subdued growthconditions in the world economy constrained exports growth. Second, the surplus on accountof invisibles also deteriorated due to moderation in private transfers. Third, the debt servicinghad increased with greater recourse to debt creating flows such as external commercialborrowings (ECBs) and non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits.  Fourth, deterioration is the fiscalposition stemming from rising expenditures accentuated the twin deficit risks.Given the already emerging vulnerabilities in India’s BoP during the 1980s, theincipient signs of stress were discernible which culminated in the BoP crisis in 1991 when theGulf War led to a sharp increase in the oil prices. On top of that, a slowdown in the worldtrade following the recessionary conditions in industrialised countries and the economicdisruption in Eastern Europe including the erstwhile USSR had begun to affect India'sexports. A large number of Indian workers employed in Kuwait had to be airlifted to Indiaand their remittances stopped. Foreign exchange reserves had already dwindled due tosignificant drawdown for financing of CAD in earlier years. During 1990-91, at one point oftime, the foreign currency assets had dipped below US$ 1.0 billion, covering barely twoweeks of imports. With increasing recourse to the borrowings on commercial terms in theprevious years, financing of CAD had also become more sensitive to creditors’ confidence inthe Indian economy.Short-term credits began to dry up and the outflow of NRI deposits was also verysubstantial. Downgrading of India’s credit rating below the investment grade also constrainedIndia’s access in the international markets for funds, especially ECBs and trade credit. Eventhough the stress in India’s BoP was unprecedented, the Government decided to honour all4debt obligations without seeking any rescheduling (Reddy, 2006).In response to the BoP crisis, a combination of standard and unorthodox policies forstabilisation and structural change was undertaken to ensure that the crisis did not translateinto generalised financial instability. Such steps included pledging gold reserves,4Reddy, Y.V. (2006), “Dynamics of Balance of Payments in India”, Speech at the first Diamond Jubilee lectureof the Department of Commerce, Osmania University on December 16.6discouraging of non-essential imports, accessing credit from the IMF and other multilateraland bilateral donors. While dealing with the crisis through an IMF programme, acomprehensive programme of structural reforms was undertaken simultaneously with specialemphasis on the external sector.The broad approach to reform in the external sector was laid out in the Report of theHigh Level Committee on Balance of Payments (Chairman: C. Rangarajan, 1993). Tradepolicies, exchange rate policies and industrial policies were recognised as part of anintegrated policy framework so as to boost the overall productivity, competitiveness andefficiency of the economy. In addition, to contain the trade and current account deficits andenhance export competitiveness, the exchange rate of rupee was adjusted downwards in twostages on July 1 and July 3, 1991 by 9 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. A dual exchangerate system was introduced in March 1992 which was unified in March 1993. Subsequently,India moved to current account convertibility in August 1994 by liberalising varioustransactions relating to merchandise trade and invisibles.The impact of policy changes was reflected in lower CAD and its comfortablefinancing in subsequent years. India could manage the external shocks that emanated fromthe East Asian crisis in 1997 and subsequently, the rise in international oil prices and burstingof dotcom bubble in 1999-2000.  Indeed, the Indian economy remained relatively insulatedfrom the East Asian crisis owing to the reforms undertaken in previous years and proactiveand timely policy measures initiated by the Reserve Bank to minimise the contagion effect.Monetary tightening coupled with flexible exchange rate and steps to bolster reserves throughissuance of Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs) helped in stabilizing the BoP.  The BoP came under some stress again in the first half of 2000-01 due to a sharp risein oil prices and increase in interest rates in advanced countries. At the same time, India’ssoftware exports got a boost following the demands to address the Y2K challenges. This alsoencouraged migration of Indian software engineers to the advanced countries. As a result, thesurplus in the services exports and remittance account of the BoP increased sharply whichmore than offset the deficit in the trade account.  Software exports rose from 0.9 per cent ofGDP in 1999-2000 to a peak of 3.8 per cent of GDP by 2008-09. Private remittances alsorose from 2.7 per cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent during this period. Thus, in the 2000s softwareexports and private remittances emerged as two main financing items for the current accountmitigating to a large extent the merchandise trade deficit (Tables 2 & 3). Owing to a7combination of factors, in fact, the current account recorded a surplus during 2001-04.Subsequently, as international oil prices started rising and domestic growth picked up, deficitin current account re-emerged during 2004-05 to 2007-08 albeit remained range bound.Table 2: Trend in Net Invisibles(Per cent of GDP)1950-80 1980-90 1990-00 2000-09 2009-121.

As capital inflows plummeted, India had to draw down itsforeign currency assets by US $ 20 billion during 2008-09. Stress since the collapse ofLehman Brothers largely emanated from decline in India’s merchandise exports anddeceleration in growth in services exports. Though there was some improvement during2010-11 on the back of a strong pick-up in exports mainly led by diversification of trade interms of composition as well as direction, it proved to be short-lived. BoP again came understress during 2011-12 as slowdown in advanced economies spilled over to emerging anddeveloping economies (EDEs), and there was sharp increase in oil and gold imports. Let menow turn to the financing aspects of the current account.India’s openness, both in terms of trade flows and capital flows which increased in the1990s accelerated in the 2000s (Chart 5). This was made possible due to substantialliberalisation of the capital account and greater openness to private capital.8In the first three decades after the independence, CAD was mainly financed byexternal assistance and drawdown of forex reserves.  Since much of India’s planning strategywas conceived in terms of a closed economy theoretical framework, private investmentinflows into the economy were not encouraged much. Therefore, foreign resources cameprimarily in the form of official transfers. The private investment came mainly throughtechnology transfer, but played a minuscule role. During this period, the development effortsand stress on BoP from time to time led India to tap diverse aid sources for specific projects.In the 1980s, as the traditional source of official concessional flows dried up therewas a need to access private capital. But, this came in the form of debt creating flows thoughcostly external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and NRI deposits. The limitations offinancing CAD through debt creating flows were exposed in the 1991 crisis. Subsequentreforms and opening up the capital account to non-debt creating flows of foreign directinvestment (FDI) and  portfolio equity flows not only completely transformed the sources offinancing of the BoP but it also resulted in substantial addition to reserves in the 2000s (Table4 & Chart 6).9Table 4: Composition of Capital FlowsPeriod 1951- 1980s 1990s 2000-09 2009-12801.

Eventhough the reform process has strengthened resilience of India’s external sector, at the sametime vulnerabilities arise with greater exposure of the economy to the rest of world throughliberalised trade and investment environment.10India’s current account particularly remains vulnerable to developments in the tradeaccount. It is evident from the size of trade deficit growing from 0.5 per cent of GDP during1951-55 to 8.7 per cent during 2007-12. In 2011-12, the current account deficit has widenedto a record 4.2 per cent of GDP (Chart 7). Over the years, current account derived someresilience from surplus generated by invisibles, particularly software exports and privatetransfers, but trade deficit continues to dictate the overall trend in the current account.Whenever trade account worsens reflecting downswings in the global business cycle or risein international oil prices, the current account also comes under stress as is evident in thepresent context. Going forward, since India’s linkage with the world economy, in terms oftrade and finance, is likely to grow further, it is important that resilience in its trade account isbuilt up mainly by promoting productivity based export competitiveness and improvingdomestic fundamentals that are supportive of least costly non-debt creating flows, particularlyforeign direct investment (FDI). In this context, I make a few suggestions.  First, the current level of CAD is far above the level sustainable for India. As perestimates, at a nominal growth rate of about 13 per cent, the sustainable current account to5GDP ratio is 2.3 per cent (Rangarajan, 2012) . Reserve Bank’s own research shows thateconomy can sustain CAD of about 2.5 per cent of GDP under a scenario of slower growth5Rangarajan, C. (2012), “India’s External Sector: Do We need to worry”, ECGC Business CommencementCommemorative Lecture at Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd., Mumbai on October 3.116(RBI, 2012).  A slowing global economy and protracted high levels of unemployment inadvanced economies make it difficult to boost services exports in the short run. If theslowdown continues, it could also have an adverse impact on inward remittances. Hence,there is a need to reduce imports and boost merchandise exports to bring the CAD tosustainable levels.  Second, structural policy measures are needed to reduce vulnerability emanating fromhigh oil and gold imports. While oil has been a major component of India’s imports, the sharpincrease in demand for gold has put an additional pressure. During 2008-09 to 2011-12, onaverage, the net gold imports stood at about 2 per cent of GDP, almost double the levelrecorded during 2004-05 to 2007-08. Thus, during the same period, CAD-GDP ratio,excluding net gold imports, would seem less problematic at 1.1 per cent as compared to asurplus of 0.2 per cent. In addition to the traditional motive of gold demand for jewellery,gold seems to have become a safe investment asset and a hedge against inflation as isobserved in other advanced economies. Its dematerialisation like any other financial product7can reduce its physical imports (Gokarn, 2012). Furthermore, inflation indexed bonds couldalso be another option to offer investors the inflation linked returns and detract them fromgold investments. In the case of oil, we need to become more energy efficient to reduce ourdependence on oil imports. Stepping up of production of electricity could reduce oil demandfrom backup generation systems. Moreover, the domestic pricing of oil should be alignedfurther to the international prices to rationalise oil consumption.Third, current policies towards further diversification of India’s export basket, bothdestination and products, needs to be stepped up. Indian exporters need to accelerate effortsto move up in the value chain at the global level.Fourth, given the global uncertainties and volatility in capital flows, the resilience ofcapital account needs to be further enhanced by encouraging FDI inflows. To conclude, the Indian economy is much more open and globalised now than everbefore. The periodic pressures on BoP have been addressed through policy changes. Whilethe BoP has again come under stress since 2011-12 as emphasised by Governor Dr Subbarao,6 Reserve Bank of India (2012), Annual Report, 2011-12.7 Gokarn, Subir (2012), “India’s Gold Problem: Finding Solution through Financial Products”, speech atthBANCON, on 25 November, 2012 at Pune.128the situation is not as serious as it was in 1991. This is because the structure of the economyhas changed in a fundamental way with flexible exchange rate and greater depth in financialmarkets, besides much larger foreign exchange reserves than those in 1991. However, there isa need to bring the CAD to sustainable levels in the short run and over the medium-term toaccelerate efforts towards structural reforms that help boosting our competitiveness, raisegrowth potential and bring in more stable flows into the economy.8Subbarao, D., “Macroeconomic Situation Assessment and Prospects”, Speech delivered at Indian Merchants’Chamber, Mumbai on June 19, 201213
