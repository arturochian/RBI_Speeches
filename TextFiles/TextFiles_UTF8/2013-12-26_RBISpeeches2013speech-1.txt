  Unconventional Monetary Policy: The Indian Experience   ? with Crisis Response and Policy Exit     I thank Principal Uma Subramaniam for this opportunity to interact with you on  unconventional monetary policy. The seminar is topical and timely. It is now 5 years  since the collapse of the Lehman Brothers in September 2008, which evoked  unprecedented monetary policy activism  both conventional and unconventional -  across the advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs). It is for the first time on  December 18, 2013 that the US Fed announced concrete measures to exit from  unconventional monetary policy in a calibrated manner starting January 2014.  The Indian economy like other EMEs was affected both by the global financial  crisis post-Lehman and the announcement of likely exit by the US Fed in May 2013.  We also resorted to both conventional and unconventional policies not only in  response to the crisis but also to the announcement of exit, though there were  qualitative differences in these responses.   Against this backdrop, I will begin by distinguishing unconventional monetary  policy from conventional policy, highlight the contours of unconventional policies in  major advance economies and review the impact of such policies. I will then turn to  the impact on India and our monetary policy response. I will end by drawing a few  broad conclusions.  Conventional and Unconventional Monetary Policy   Conventional monetary policy is understood as central banks operating with a  short-term policy interest rate in the money market to signal the stance of monetary  policy and in the process influence the term structure of market interest rates to  achieve the objectives of price stability with sustainable growth. Price stability is not  an end in itself. Price stability, defined as a low and stable inflation, is considered a                                                                ?

Bhoi and  Rajeev Jain in preparation of this paper is acknowledged.  1 prerequisite for sustainable growth over the medium-term. It is believed that there is  no trade-off between growth and inflation over the medium-term. Even countries  which have chosen inflation targeting framework try to stabilise output around its  potential and inflation around its target level. Hence, normally in the event of a shock  when either or both the parameters drift from their targets, the objective is to bring it  back to target over the medium-term. However, conventional monetary policy has a  limiting condition of zero lower bond. For example, in the event of an extreme  shock, as it happened during the global financial crisis, when policy rates were brought  down close to zero, further monetary stimulus was not possible through conventional  monetary policy.   When central banks look beyond their traditional instrument of policy interest  rate, monetary policy takes an unconventional character. It essentially means using  quantity instruments for expanding the balance sheet of the central bank. It can take  different forms: quantitative easing (QE) through direct long-term asset purchase by  the central bank, credit easing (CE) by the central bank directly intervening in a  particular segment of the credit market. Both QE and CE can be accompanied by  dilution of collateral standards by the central bank expanding the list of collateral  beyond its traditional preference for low risk sovereign bonds. Unconventional  monetary policy is invariably accompanied by forward guidance regarding the future  path of monetary policy to work on the expectations channel. This is because the  efficacies of asset purchases programme depend on the behaviour of market  participants and financial entities. It is likely that market participants may not alter  their behaviour without knowing what the central bank will do in the future with  regard to these instruments.    In the event of a crisis, it is not unusual for central banks to expand their  balance sheets. The greatest received wisdom in central banking is the lender of last  resort (LOLR) function based on the Bagehot principle that,  the central bank should  1 lend freely against good collateral at a penal r ate .  In fact, many early central banks                                                                1  Bagehot Walter (1873), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, King &Co., London;  reprinted Wiley, New York 1999.  2 including the US Fed were instituted to largely discharge this function. Monetary  policy as we understand today was alien then.  It is a different matter that the recent  global financial crisis tested the limits of Bagehot principle as never before.   Contours of Unconventional Monetary Policy  Let me now turn to how the US Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB), the  Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) unveiled their unconventional  monetary policies. I may mention that the BoJ was using unconventional monetary  policy much earlier as Japan went into prolonged deflation from the late 1990s.   The global financial crisis which erupted with collapse of major financial  institutions in advanced economies was unprecedented in its scale. Not only did it lead  to a sharp decline in asset prices, freezing of credit markets, and the loss of confidence  in the building blocks of the financial system, its impact was magnified through quick  transmission to other economies as well. Monetary authorities in the advanced  economies were the first to resort to aggressive monetary easing first by reducing  policy rates. However, key channels of conventional monetary policy were severely  impaired during the crisis as policy rates in most advanced economies approached zero  lower bound (Chart 1).   Chart 1: Key Policy Rates: Select Advanced Economies    Source: Respective Central Bank Websites.  3 Taking cognisance of the severity of the crisis and concerns of economic  recession, central banks used their balance sheets in unconventional ways to augment  liquidity (Table 1). The QE programmes initially attempted to alleviate financial  market distress, but this purpose soon broadened to include achieving inflation targets,  stimulating the real economy, and containing the European sovereign debt crisis  2 (Fawley and Neely, 2013) . Now let us discuss a little about the rationale for  unconventional policies undertaken across major economies.

In the US, immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when slow  growth and high unemployment emerged as major concerns, the Fed announced the  policy of quantitative easing (QE) in November 2008. The first two rounds of QEs  reactivated financial markets, but failed to spur growth. Under Operation Twi st  instituted in September 2011, the Fed took initiative of buying longer-term Treasuries  and simultaneously selling some of the shorter-dated securities to bring down long- term interest rates which continued till December 2012.  With a view to putting in  place a stronger version QE, it launched QE3 in September 2012. Under QE3, the Fed  started purchasing US$85 billion of fixed-income securities per month. The Fed  intended to keep QE3 in effect until unemployment falls to 6.5 per cent or inflation  rises to 2.5 per cent. In addition to QE3, the Fed gave a forward guidance that it would  keep short-term rates low through 2015. As economic parameters showed  improvement, the Fed started talking about exit, popularly known as the tapering of  bond buying in May 2013. Subsequently, it announced to slow the pace of the bond  buying program by US$ 10 billion per month from January 2014.  In the UK, after reducing the policy rate (i.e., Bank Rate) to 0.5 per cent in  March 2009, the Bank of England (BoE) started its asset purchase programmes which  consisted almost exclusively of government bonds from the non-bank private sector.   Subsequently, the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) was put in place in July 2012  5 with the aim of incentivising banks and building societies to boost their lending to the  3 UK real economy .                      Japans economy had deteriorated for nearly 15 years under the threat of  deflation. To overcome deflation, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) engaged in a wide range of  monetary easing efforts ? including the implementation of the zero interest rate policy,  the quantitative easing policy and comprehensive monetary easing, but there have  4 been no easily derived concrete results . Following the crisis, the BoJ embarked on an  ambitious asset purchase program to combat deflation. In October 2012, it announced  purchase of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), commercial paper, corporate bonds,  exchange traded funds (ETF), Japanese real estate investment trusts (J-REITS). In  April 2013, BoJ announced Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing Program  under which it purchases JGBs, ETFs and J-REITs with the goal of increasing the  monetary base by 60-70 trillion JPY annually, increasing the average maturity of JGBs  held from three to seven years and meeting the 2 per cent inflation target in about two  years.  In the euro area, concerns over counter-party risk eventually led to drying up of  interbank lending by early 2009. The European Central Bank (ECB) responded in May  2009, by reducing its main refinancing rate to 1 per cent and by introducing 12-month  LTROs and the covered bond purchase program (CBPP). The ECB substantially  extended its liquidity provision by offering unlimited longer-term refinancing  operations. The ECB also purchased some securities outright in distressed markets  through its securities markets program (SMP), which was, however, later replaced by  the pledge to intervene more decisively through Outright Monetary Transactions  (OMTs).   The unconventional measures undertaken have involved extraordinary central  bank lending, expanding central bank balance sheets substantially (Chart 2). We learn                                                                3  Bank of England (2012),  T h e Funding for Lending S c h e m e  , Quarterly Bulletin 2012 Q4.  4  Kuroda, Haruhiko (2013),  Q ua n t i t a t i v e and Qualitative Monetary E a s i n g  , Speech at a Meeting held by the  Yomiuri International Economic Society in Tokyo, April 12.  6 from text books and the inflation experiences of the 1970s that a sharp increase in base  money could be inflationary. On the contrary, in the current episode inflation declined  below target levels in many advanced countries.  Chart 2: Central Bank Balance Sheets    Note: Data are sourced from respective central bank websites. For BoE and RBI, they  relate to financial year and for others calendar year. For other countries, GDP as  projected by the IMF is used for calculating the ratios.     Partly the explanation lies in the fact that despite such increase in the size of  balance sheets, broad money supply did not expand significantly. This was due to  perceptible decline in money multiplier on account of banks building up cash reserves  on being risk averse and to conserve on required capital rather than lending to the real  economy (Chart 3). Moreover, with interest rates at near zero level, the opportunity  costs of holding money for the money holding sector also fell. Another interesting  explanation is that inflation expectations remained well anchored, meaning once  economic entities believe that inflation will not go up it does not go up. Further, with  the economy operating below its capacity the scope for inflation from wage increase is  not there. While consumer price inflation may not rise in the short run, it cannot be  presumed that asset price inflation will not go up given the excess liquidity.        7   Chart 3: Money Multiplier : Select Economies      MB: Monetary Base.      The large scale economic downturn accompanying the financial crisis also led  to activation of counter-cyclical fiscal policy of unprecedented magnitude. The fiscal  measures focused on improving the balance sheet of the financial and corporate  sectors as reflected in large scale bailouts in the US and other advanced  economies.  Reflecting such fiscal stimulus measures, advanced economies witnessed  significant deterioration in their fiscal position as reflected in high public debt to GDP  ratios (Chart 4). Let me now turn to the experience of EMEs.                8     Chart 4: Government Balance and Public Debt        Source: IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2013.    Experience of EMEs  Initially, it was viewed that EMEs would remain insulated from global financial  meltdown on the back of the significant buffers they have built over the years, which  included substantial foreign exchange reserves, improved policy frameworks and  generally robust banking sector and corporate balance sheets. However, as the crisis  deepened following the failure of Lehman Brothers and resulted in heightened risk  aversion and global deleveraging, the EMEs were also affected in varying degrees.  The contagion from the global financial crisis also warranted swift monetary  and fiscal policy responses in EMEs with a view to ensuring orderly functioning of  markets, preserving financial stability, and moderating its adverse effects on growth.  9 In the process, their policy responses became more synchronised with global efforts  5 (Mohanty, 2011) .   While both developed economies and EMEs resorted to conventional and  unconventional monetary measures, there were certain differences in terms of their  timing, types and magnitudes. First, while in the advanced economies the switchover  was from conventional monetary tools to unconventional measures due to policy rates  approaching zero, in many EMEs, unconventional foreign exchange easing and  domestic liquidity augmenting measures preceded the conventional measures of policy  rate cuts. Second, while central banks in EMEs relied mostly on direct instruments  such as reserve requirements to ease domestic liquidity, central banks in advanced  countries resorted to various liquidity providing operations through relaxation of  counter-parties, collaterals and maturity. Third, central banks in advanced countries  extensively used credit and quantitative easing measures which led to large expansion  of their balance sheets unlike in EMEs. Fourth, while in advanced economies fiscal  support aimed at rescuing the financial sector from the crisis situation, in EMEs they  were generally meant to address the deficiency in aggregate demand. Let me now turn  to some of the consequences of unconventional policy.  Impact of Unconventional Policies   As most of the unconventional monetary policy measures were undertaken  keeping in view the domestic economies, the attendant increase in global liquidity  appears to have impacted a range of asset classes in both advanced and emerging  economies (Chart 5). There are studies which find significant impact of QE. They  suggest reduction in US treasury yields around 100 basis points, corporate bond yields  by 80 basis points, and reduction in the range of 20-80 basis points in other advanced  6 economies . In case of some EMEs, the evidence suggested high capital inflow  pressure, rapid domestic credit growth and domestic inflationary pressures.                                                                 5  Mohanty, Deepak (2011),  L e s s o n s for Monetary Policy from the Global Financial Crisis: An Emerging  Market P e r s pe c t i v e  , RBI Bulletin, April.   6  Chen, Q., A.

Furthermore, indications about the possible withdrawal since the talk about US  taper in May 2013 has caused volatility in financial markets in EMEs and impacted  currency valuations as capital retreated back to the US in anticipation of higher interest  rates. EMEs, particularly with large current account and fiscal deficits, were severely  impacted. Let me turn to our experience with the crisis, and now with the talk of taper.    Indian Experience with the Crisis and Policy Exit   Until the emergence of the global crisis, India had experienced a phase of high  growth along with low and stable inflation. Growth was largely driven by high  domestic demand - growing domestic investment financed mostly by domestic savings  11 and sustained consumption demand. Sequential financial sector reforms, rule-based  fiscal policy and forward looking monetary policy together contributed to the overall  improved macroeconomic performance.  Following the emergence of the crisis, India, initially remained somewhat  insulated to the global developments, but eventually was impacted significantly  through all the channels  financial, real and more importantly, the confidence channel  7 (Subbarao, 2009) . This could be attributed to the global nature of the crisis on the one  hand and accelerated trade and financial integration of the Indian economy with the  world on the other.   The impact of the crisis was first visible on I ndias financial markets in the  form of tightening of liquidity and higher volatility in all market segments along with  sharp decline in stock prices. Risk aversion on the part of global investors resulted in  moderation in capital inflows and exchange rate depreciation. Credit growth  decelerated reflecting weakening business confidence. Growth, which was already on  a cyclical moderation in the first half of 2008-09, decelerated significantly during the  second half. As a result, growth declined to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09 from the preceding  5-year average of 8.7 per cent per annum (Table 2).                                                                 7  Subbarao, D.

The Reserve Bank, like most other  central banks, took a number of conventional and unconventional measures to limit the  adverse impact of the contagion on the Indian financial markets and the economy.  These included augmenting domestic and foreign exchange liquidity and a sharp  reduction in the policy rate. The Reserve Bank used multiple instruments such as the  liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), open market operations (OMO), cash reserve ratio  (CRR) and securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) to augment the  liquidity in the system.     These measures were supported by fiscal stimulus packages which raised the  fiscal deficit of the Central Government by about 3.5 per cent of GDP to 6.0 per cent  in 2008-09 (Chart 6).   13   Chart 6: Gross Fiscal Deficit and Public Debt in India        On the back of substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus, growth bounced back  quickly. However, inflation also picked up. Consequently, the policy focus shifted to  exit from accommodative monetary policy in a calibrated manner starting in October  2009. To begin with all special liquidity measures were withdrawn which was  followed by hikes in policy rate. As the real policy rate turned positive it started to  have an impact on inflation.   Going into the financial year 2012-13, growth declined and headline WPI  inflation showed a clear sign of moderation. This prompted the Reserve Bank to  reduce the policy rate (Chart 7).             14 Chart 7: Calibration of Policy Rates in India         As the economic conditions appeared to be stabilising, volatility in the financial  market returned following the announcement in May 2013 of the Feds intention of  likely tapering of QE. This prompted the Reserve Bank to resort to somewhat  unconventional monetary policy measures besides drawing down of foreign exchange  reserves to meet the immediate shortfall (Chart 8). Let me give you the flavour of key  measures.  Chart 8: Exchange Rate and Foreign Exchange Reserves    Note: Reserves increase (+) / decrease (-).  RHS scale is in reverse order.  15  In terms of monetary policy, the upper bound of the policy rate corridor (i.e.,  MSF rate) was raised by 200 basis points and the quantity of central bank  liquidity available through the LAF window was restrained. This had the desired  effect of tightening the monetary conditions and raising the effective policy rate  sharply to the MSF rate.    In order to signal that the above measure is temporary so that the interest rates at  the longer end do not harden a form of operation twist was tried by conducting  outright OMO purchase of government securities alongside sale of short-term  government cash management bills. This inverted the yield curve, though  accompanied by some increase in long-term rates.   With a view to containing the current account deficit (CAD) on the balance of  payments (BoP), gold imports were restricted.   The non-resident deposit schemes and ban k s  borrowing abroad were further  liberalised with incentives for swapping these inflows directly with the Reserve  Bank. This substantially augmented foreign exchange reserves despite some  outflow on account of directly meeting the foreign exchange requirement of oil  imports.         As portfolio capital outflows waned and BoP improved, stability returned to the  foreign exchange market. This prompted the Reserve Bank to unwind the bulk of the  exceptional measures and normalise monetary policy by restoring the policy interest  rate corridor to its original position and the repo rate to its signalling role of policy.  Though the policy repo rate was increased by 25 basis points each in September and  November 2013, this was more on considerations of emerging growth and inflation  balance.   Conclusion   Let me conclude.   First, the global financial crisis triggered unprecedented policy activism by  advance country central banks. They resorted to unconventional monetary policy of  the nature and scale unthinkable hitherto.  16  Second, as we complete over 5 years of unconventional monetary policy of QE  and CE, the question is: did it succeed? While it is too early to say, opinion remains  divided. Thus far, with unconventional policies, the central banks have been far less  8 successful in stimulating growth . While it may not have improved general monetary  transmission and prompted sustainable recovery, it did have significant impact on the  financial market. The counterfactual of what would have happened without QE is not  known? In any case, it seems to have prevented a deeper recession.   Third, the spillover effect of QE on commodity markets and emerging market  economies (EMEs) has been significant. This has resulted in increased volatility of  capital flows and elevated asset prices. The initiation of exit from QE has also created  additional macroeconomic challenges for EMEs including India.    Fourth, the Indian economy and financial markets were significantly impacted  by the global financial crisis and the recent signalling of exit from QE by the Fed. This  prompted the Reserve Bank to resort to both conventional and unconventional  monetary policy alongside other regulatory policies to stabilise markets.   Finally, while the exit from QE increases uncertainties in the financial market,  it is increasingly felt that continuation of unconventional monetary policy for long  could create risks in the global economy it sought to address by preventing  deleveraging and appropriate pricing of risks. In addition, the current policy response  has increased sovereign risk in a number of countries which circumscribes the ability  of policy to cushion further unexpected shocks.
