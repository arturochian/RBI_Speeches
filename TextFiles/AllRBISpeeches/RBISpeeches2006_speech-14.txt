????Globalisation, Money and Finance – Uncertainties and DilemmasDear friends,I am honoured to be invited to deliver the valedictory address at the 2006FICCI-IBA Conference. I would like to begin by complimenting the hosts for theirchoice of the theme: “Global Banking: Paradigm Shift”. Many distinguishedspeakers have participated already in the deliberations and hence I will attempt abroader overview of globalisation issues at the current juncture.  My address is on“Globalisation, Money and Finance – Uncertainties and Dilemmas”. These are inthe nature of random thoughts - to provoke thinking and not to provide answers orpractise preaching.Globalisation – Is There a Rethink?In the recent period, a reassessment of the costs and benefits associatedwith globalisation seems to be taking place.  Already, the share of the emergingcountries in world exports has surged to 43 per cent from 20 per cent in 1970.Domestic structural reforms in the emerging economies are unlocking the pent-updomestic demand and, in turn, enabling a greater realisation of the huge potentialfor growth.  So, what is causing the rethink in both – the developed and theemerging economies?  Several factors seem to be at work.Firstly, the traditional postulate that the capital flows from the capital-surplus or developed countries to the capital-scarce or developing countries,seems to have been disproved in recent years.  Today, we are confronted with thepuzzle of capital flowing uphill (Prasad, Rajan and Subramanian, 2006) that is,from the developing to the developed countries.  The world's largest economy, theUnited States, currently runs a current account deficit, financed to a substantialextent by capital exports from the emerging market economies.Further, the level of financial development per se does not seem todetermine the direction of capital flows. Prasad et al argue that the phenomenon                                                ? Valedictory address by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the FICCI-IBA Conference heldin Mumbai on September 28, 2006.2mainly reflects the limited absorption capacity of the developing countries in thecontext of relatively lower financial development.  However, this explanation canbe turned around. The US, which has perhaps the most well developed financialsystem, is currently importing capital. As the developing countries catch up interms of sophistication and depth in their financial systems, would the pattern ofcapital flows change, and how?  In the interregnum, the export of capital from thedeveloping to the developed countries has no doubt revitalised global growth. Butwill this or can this go on?Secondly, in a globalising world, the policy makers seem to be confrontedwith new realities, sometimes hard to fully comprehend. In a way, the context inwhich monetary policy is set leads to a confrontation with the impossible trinity –independent monetary policy, open capital account and managed exchange rate.The theory holds that at best, only two out of the three would be feasible. Inpractice, however, there is a shift in preference away from the corner solution withrespect to financial imbalances.  Currently, intermediate solutions, which wereearlier regarded as ‘fuzzy’, are now becoming increasingly relevant. Moreover, inrecognition of the differences between trade and financial integration – firstpointed out by Jagdish Bhagwati – there is less certainty today about the cornersolutions than in the past.Thirdly, at a practical level, the recent experience seems to indicate thatglobalisation may have had accentuated potential conflicts that can impact thefabric of our societies.  Outsourcing to low-wage countries to derive benefits oflower cost, has generated restiveness in the labour markets of the advancedcountries, particularly in the skilled segment of tradable services that are moreexposed to foreign competition. The geographical fragmentation of productionbase has increasingly been used by big firms as a bargaining tool with workers.Increased emigration from the developing and emerging countries has depressedwages in the advanced economies and heightened social tensions. In recentyears, the contractionary effects of cooling of the housing markets may also bebuilding up further pressure against globalisation.3Fourthly, there are wide-spread concerns about the gaps in internationaltrade rules and regulations, the impasse in multilateral trade negotiations andconsequently, a rising number of regional and bilateral trade arrangements whichcould rule out the use of the very policy measures that were instrumental in thedevelopment of today’s mature economies and late industrialisers.Fifthly, the rapid pace of globalisation in monetary and financialrelationships has not been accompanied by an improvement in the internationalfinancial architecture. The provision of liquidity to enable the countries to weatherpayments difficulties has arguably been inadequate. Managing financial crisisremains largely a national responsibility. As the UNCTAD’s Trade andDevelopment Report, 2006 has noted: ‘‘The bulk of adjustment in case of externalimbalances is often concentrated on a group of developing and transitioneconomies, despite the fact that the source of such imbalances may occur in thedeveloped world’’ (Overview, p. 38-39). This seems to have provoked anaccumulation of foreign exchange reserves in the emerging countries.In the wake of these developments, there is a growing expression ofheightened sensitivity to the costs associated with globalisation. In the ultimateanalysis, public policy has important role in managing the costs and benefits ofglobalisation.  When the going is good, public policy is viewed with disfavour.  Inthe face of adverse conditions, however, public policy intervention is often the onlysought-after solution.  Accordingly, it is the public policy which has the bestchance of preserving the benefits of globalisation and ensuring that these arewidely shared so as to maintain support for free trade and to stem protectionism,thereby providing globalisation with the popular legitimacy which, at present,seems to be sometimes lacking. “Making Globalisation Work” is the challenge forthe policy makers so that the benefits of globalisation are sufficiently shared anddemonstrably exceed the attendant costs.  To quote Chairman Bernanke: ‘‘Furtherprogress in global economic integration should not be taken for granted…as in thepast, the social and political opposition to openness can be strong… much of itarises because changes in the patterns of production are likely to threaten thelivelihoods of some workers and the profits of some firms…The natural reaction of4those so affected is to resist change, for example, by seeking the passage of1protectionist measures’’ (Jackson Hole, 2006).Globalisation and Monetary PolicyWhile considerations relating to maximising output and employment weighas much upon monetary authorities as maintaining price stability, particularly inthe developing countries, domestic inflation has increasingly become lesssensitive to the domestic output gap and potentially more sensitive to the worldoutput gap. It is, therefore, necessary for each country to take a holistic approachto the trinity of free flows of capital, freely floating exchange rates andindependent monetary policy. At a practical policy level, the trinity can beregarded as implausible and difficult, but manageable through intermediatesolutions that adapt to the country-specific situations.  For monetary authorities,the new realities provide, perhaps, unknown challenges in an uncertain future,heightening the dilemmas in policy-making.Central banks are often concerned with the stability / variability of inflationrather than the level of prices. However, inflation processes have become highlyunclear, with soaring commodity prices co-existing with low consumer prices in anenvironment of high asset prices.  Amidst these uncertainties, central banks arefaced with the need to recognise the importance of inflation perceptions andinflation expectations as distinct from inflation numbers. The distinction betweeninflationary expectations and inflation perceptions in the context of inflation policyis also worth bearing in mind. More often than not, the expected change ratherthan the actual change in real interest rate, following a change in the policy rate,often drives the actions of the economic agents. Thus, the ability to conditioninflation expectations, rather than the decisions on the policy rates, is offundamental importance to monetary policy making now. In this context, crediblecommunication and creative engagement with the market and economic agents                                                1 Bernanke, B. (2006), ‘‘Global Economic Integration: What’s New and What’s Not?’’, Remarks atthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Thirtieth Annual Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole,August 25.5has emerged as the critical channel of monetary transmission as against thetraditional channels.The presence of administered interest rates, even in segments of afinancial system, could hold back appropriate adjustments in real rates as asequel to changes in the policy rates. What is surprising, however, is that thefinancial market rates could also display such impervious behaviour and thereby,act as the source of nominal rigidities in the economy. The recent ‘conundrum’ inthe financial markets a la Greenspan is a case in point. As a result, long-term realrates in the financial markets have changed but not in the desired direction,posing challenges to the effectiveness of monetary policy even in a market-basedsystem. Therefore, not only the change in real rates but also the direction ofchange following changes in the policy rates is important for the effectiveness ofmonetary policy.In a relatively more stable economic environment, the need, the extent andthe duration of the policy interventions becomes less and less.  Central banks arenow taking baby steps – sometimes more frequent steps and at other times after along gap, and in both directions – to respond to, what appear to be, ripples ratherthan huge waves in the sea of economic activity.  For instance, what is consideredas a ‘neutral rate’ of interest, in the present period, appears to be much lowercompared to several years before. The issue of significance here is whether theneutral rate in respect of the emerging market economies, which has been comingdown in tandem with global rates, will tend to be distinctly higher than in thedeveloped economies.  If so, how much higher would be appropriate?Even a moderate inflation rate poses a dilemma in an increasingly open-economy framework. If the domestic inflation rate of an economy, however low itmay be, is higher than the average inflation rate of its trading partners, it putspressure on the exchange rate. In this context, the question of simultaneousbalance of the internal and external sectors becomes a major issue.  The conductof monetary policy inevitably involves a careful judgment on the relative weights                                                                                                                                                  6assigned to the domestic and the global factors and constant reassessment ofthese in response to evolving circumstances.In a dynamic setting, when the financial markets are continually evolving,and payment systems and technology are changing rapidly, one may not find aclear-cut evidence of stability in monetary rules and intermediate targeting. Insuch circumstances, monetary authorities are being constrained to look at allrelevant indicators, following a menu or a ‘check list’ approach. Discerning newsfrom noise is a persistent dilemma for conducting monetary policy.Since external capital flows to emerging economies cannot be easilypredicted and can also reverse even in the presence of sound fundamentals,monetary authorities have to make choices in regard to exchange rate andmonetary management, very often. The appropriate management of monetarypolicy may require the monetary authorities to consider offsetting the impact offoreign exchange market operations, partly or wholly, so as to retain the intent ofmonetary policy. The monetary authority has to decide on the extent of off-set asalso the means of off-set – market based or non-market based or a combination ofthe two.Financial stability considerations may require the use of interest rate tool, inconjunction with other prudential measures.  Some times, there could be even atrade-off between raising the short-term interest rate and tightening of prudentialnorms, if the risks are perceived to originate from certain segments of the market.The highly leveraged lending operations in the backdrop of asset-price bubblesmight require adjustments in the lending margins and risk-based capitalrequirements. An issue in this regard is the extent to which these should beconsidered akin to the erstwhile selective credit controls.Globalisation and the Financial SectorThe international financial markets are currently dominated by privateequity funds like hedge funds, which are largely operating outside the ‘Know-your-customer’/ ‘Know-your-investor’ (KYC/KYI) norms. Hedge funds have long used7arrangements that allow them to execute trades with several dealers but there isnow an increasing tendency on their part to consolidate the clearing andsettlement of their trades at a single firm, the "prime broker". Prime brokerageposes some unique challenges for the management of counterparty credit andoperational risk.It is commonly observed at the global level that hedge funds are "opaque"– that is, information about their portfolios is typically limited and infrequentlyprovided. The information a fund provides may also vary considerably dependingon whether the recipient of the information is an investor, a counterparty, aregulatory authority, or a general market participant. From a policy perspective,transparency to investors is largely an issue of investor protection, which, in turn,depends on the nature of investors. The need for counterparties to have adequateinformation is a risk-management issue. Concerns about hedge fund opacity andpossible liquidity risk have motivated a range of proposals for regulatoryauthorities to create and maintain a database of hedge fund positions.There are some uncertainties associated with the settling of trades innewer types of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, particularly credit derivatives.As part of recent financial innovations, the credit-derivative and structured-creditmarkets have grown rapidly during the past few years, allowing dispersion ofcredit risk by financial players. Perhaps, it is necessary to evolve mechanisms toascertain the size and structure of risk components, the scale and direction of risktransfers, and, therefore, the distribution of risk within the economy.In the recent years, the issue of institutional mechanisms for the preventionand resolution of financial crises at the multilateral level has assumed importance.On the question whether the international financial architecture is now in aposition to give comfort if a country were to have a problem, there are fouraspects. Firstly, undoubtedly, the resilience of the world today and the privatecapital markets in particular, has improved enormously since 1997. Macro-economic policies and approaches of international financial institutions as well asthe resilience of markets have improved. Secondly, even though in terms ofmagnitude, the official/bilateral flows of funds are miniscule, the very intent of such8flows, guided by broader societal consideration, gives them strength in the face ofprivate flows. Thirdly, as we are aware, risks are never eliminated but are onlymitigated. The existing international financial architecture is not adequate toprevent or mitigate the domestic and external effects of financial crisis, particularlyin large economies like China and India. Fourthly, the impact of instability in timesof crisis appears largely to be borne by the home or domestic public sector ratherthan the global private sector. Avoiding crisis is ultimately a national responsibility.In such a milieu, the policy makers are often confronted with competing positionsand need to make choices in the face of daunting dilemmas.Concluding RemarksIn a recent survey of the world economy, The Economist (September 16,2006) predicted that the emerging economies are set to give the world economyits biggest boost since the industrial revolution. A greater integration into theglobal system of production and trade, supported by buoyant capital flows, isdriving a widening wedge between the emerging and the developed countries interms of growth rates. Already accounting for more than half of the world GDP, inpurchasing power parity terms, they will raise their share to two-thirds of the globaloutput in 20 years' time. It took 50 years for Britain and America to double realincome in the 19th century when they were industrialising; China is achieving thesame feat in nine years! Over the next decade, almost a billion new consumerswill enter the global marketplace, providing an enduring stimulus to economicactivity across the world.In all humility, it needs to be recognised that despite soaring economicgrowth, real per capita incomes and therefore, standards of living in thedeveloping countries remain well below those in the developed countries. As theBRIC report of Goldman and Sachs (2003) had thoughtfully projected, theaverage per capita income in America would still be three or four times higherthan in China even in 2040. The IMF has estimated that if India's relative percapita income rises by under 2 per cent, it will take more than a 100 years to closehalf the distance from the developed countries' per capita income levels. If India'sper capita income grows by three per cent in real terms, it will still take 69 years toclose half the gap. More important, faster growth alone will not automatically9eradicate poverty; it depends on how inclusive that growth is and how the benefitsof globalisation are shared.The future will, in all likelihood, call for some radical thinking, perhaps newvistas of development in operational and institutional frameworks of monetarypolicy. So far, it is claimed, the emerging economies have made the work ofmonetary authorities a lot easier than before by subduing inflation - bothcommodity prices and wages - and have, in fact, gifted credibility to monetarypolicy. Yet, the question that is often asked is whether the emerging economieshave facilitated holding of interest rates at very low levels by the central banks inthe developed countries. In the face of the consequent build-up of liquidity,elevated asset prices and soaring consumer indebtedness, is there a dark side tothe future? The intellectual edifice on which monetary policy is founded is rootedin the management of aggregate demand. But a supply shock arising fromglobalisation can produce vastly different growth-inflation outcomes, whichmonetary policy by itself is not fully equipped to manage.  Indeed, a question thathas been asked in this context is whether price stability is enough as a goal ofmonetary policy and how sacrosanct it is when, for instance, central banks have tocontend with financial imbalances even if it means an overshooting of inflationtargets.In a FICCI-IBA Conference, it will be remiss of me not to address therelationship between the real and the financial sectors in India in the context ofglobalisation. Economists have for long recognised the strong complementaritiesbetween the real and the financial sectors.  Financial development contributes togrowth in either a supply-leading or a demand-following sequence; that is, eitherthe financial sector development creates the conditions for growth or the growthgenerates demand for the financial services. It is important to recognise that thefinancial sector in India is no longer a constraint on growth and its strength andresilience are acknowledged, though improvements need to take place.  On theother hand, without the real sector development in terms of the physicalinfrastructure and improvement in supply elasticities, the financial sector can evenmisallocate resources, potentially generate bubbles and possibly amplify the risks.Hence, public policy may have a crucial role to play in ensuring a balanced reformin both the real and the financial sectors.  The criticality for the policy makers is10not only to ensure that there are no financial sector constraints on the real sectoractivity but also to assure that the financial sector reforms have complementaritywith the pace and process of reform in the real sector in India, along with, nodoubt, fiscal empowerment – as consistently emphasised by the Reserve Bank.Thank you.
