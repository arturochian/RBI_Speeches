Recent Developments in Forex, Money andG-Sec Markets:  Account and Outlook*Shyamala GopinathI. IntroductionIt gives me immense pleasure to address this distinguished gathering of forexprofessionals from all over the country. Coming to these visually beautifulsurroundings, it is easy to get oblivious to the fact that this state is a largecontributor of ‘invisibles’ for our balance of payments. Both tourism earningsand private remittances have had a significant impact on Kerala’s economyand the state has benefited substantially as a result of liberalisation since1991. Putting numbers to this gain, as per a study by the Centre for1Development Studies, Trivandrum , the average yearly gain to the state sincethe start of reforms has been in the range of Rs. 2000 crore.I begin this address, Ladies and Gentlemen, in the background of thisinteresting perspective.Forex market in India is undergoing rapid transformation and excitingthings are engaging us professionally. At the same time, it can no longer beseen in isolation – it is increasingly getting integrated within the broad ambit offinancial markets. Over the last fifteen years, momentous changes havehappened in the financial sector, which are well known. While the initialreforms concentrated more on the institutions like banks or non-bankingfinancial companies, the recent years have witnessed emphasis on financialmarkets.With the financial markets in India acquiring greater depth and maturityin the recent years, the issue of greater integration of various marketsegments among themselves, on the one hand, and with the global markets,on the other, has come to the forefront.  In my address I intend to take stockof the major initiatives that have been taken to reform the financial markets in                                           1 “Kerala’s Gulf Connection : Emigration, Remittances and their Macroeconomic Impact 1972-2000”, Kannan K.P and Hari K.S, Centre fro Development Studies, Working Paper No. 328th *Address by Deputy Governor at the 16 National Forex Assembly atCochin on August 13, 2005.India in the past, reflect on the present scenario and articulate the futurecourse of reforms.As you all are aware, the development of financial markets in India hasbeen pursued for bringing about a transformation in the structure, efficiency,and stability of markets as also facilitating integration of markets. Theemphasis has been on strengthening price discovery, easing of restrictionson flows or transactions, lowering of transaction costs, and enhancingliquidity. During the post-reform period, the structure of financial market haswitnessed a remarkable change in terms of the types, the number and thespectrum of maturity of financial instruments traded in various segments ofmoney, gilts and foreign exchange markets. I now dwell on the threesegments of the financial markets which fall directly under the purview of theReserve Bank of India. As this is a gathering of Forex Professionals, it wouldbe in the fitness of things  to dwell on the  reform process of the forex marketfirst.II. Forex MarketGlobal ScenarioThe global foreign exchange markets have grown manifold in therecent years. The latest BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey on forex andderivatives markets 2004 indicate a substantial rise in activity in foreignexchange markets across the world. Average daily turnover at US $ 1.9 trillionin April 2004 showed an increase of  57 per cent and 36 per cent at currentand constant exchange rates compared to April 2001, reversing the fall inglobal trading volumes between 1998 and 2001. Both global factors, such assearch for yield and a secular deepening in Asian financial marketscontributed to the strong growth. In this context, it is important to note that theshare of trading between banks and financial customers rose significantlyfrom 28 per cent in 2001 to 33 per cent in 2004.  However, the currencycomposition of turnover has not changed significantly. The  US  dollar was onone side of 89 per cent of all transactions, followed by the euro (37 per cent),the yen (20 per cent) and the Pound sterling (17 per cent). In terms ofcurrency pairs, US dollar/euro continued to be by far the most traded currencypair in April 2004, accounting for 28 per cent of global turnover, followed byUS dollar/yen with 17 per cent and US dollar/Pound sterling with 14 per cent.The percentage share of the Indian rupee, though miniscule in comparison,has almost trebled to constitute 0.3 per cent of total daily turnover.Indian Forex MarketIn an open economy environment, the foreign exchange marketassumes critical importance for stability of the financial system since banks’balance sheets are  influenced by the foreign capital inflows and variousother external transactions directly or indirectly through credit exposures. TheIndian forex market has widened and deepened since the 1990s on accountof implementation of various measures recommended by the High LevelCommittee on Balance of Payments in 1993 (Chairman: Dr. C.Rangarajan),the Expert Group on Foreign Exchange Markets in India in 1995 (Chairman:Shri O.P.Sodhani) and the Committee on Capital Account Convertibility in1997 (Chairman: Shri S.S.Tarapore). With the transition to a market-determined exchange rate system in March 1993 and the subsequent gradualliberalisation of restrictions on various external transactions, ensuring orderlyconditions in the forex market in India has become one of the key objectives.The Reserve Bank has undertaken various measures towards developmentof spot as well as forward segments of foreign exchange market. As a result,the average gross daily turnover increased to US $ 12.1 billion in 2004-05(April-March) from US $ 3.7 billion in 1996-97. The top 30 banks in Indiaaccount for approximately 90 per cent of the overall turnover in the market.Approach to Reforms in Foreign Exchange MarketWhile the operating environment is no doubt relatively more flexible incountries with current account convertibility and open capital accounts, theapproach in other countries, the approach has remained cautious with a clearemphasis on the need for safeguards against potential financial instability thatcould arise due to excessive speculation in the foreign exchange market evenwhen macroeconomic fundamentals are reasonably good. The Indianapproach to opening the external sector and developing the foreign exchangemarket in a phased manner from current account convertibility to the ongoingprocess of capital account liberalization is now considered a prudent anddesirable approach for liberalization.The recent past has witnessed significant changes in the external sectorpolicy approach of the Reserve Bank.  The focus of the measures has been togradually dismantle controls and provide an enabling environment to allentities engaged in external transactions. The approach to liberalisation,adopted by Reserve Bank has been characterised by greater transparency,data monitoring and information dissemination and to move away from micromanagement of foreign exchange transactions to macro management of forexflows. The emphasis has been to ensure that procedural formalities areminimised so that individuals are able to obtain hassle free remittances facilityfor all current account transactions and exporters and other users of themarket  are able to concentrate on their core activities rather than engage inavoidable paper work. Besides, the Reserve Bank has also striven to ensurethat strong Know-Your-Customer (KYC) guidelines are in place. In thisenabling environment, today the Indian corporate sector is reaching out to theglobal production and distribution networks not only through greaterorientation towards exports or imports but also through strategic takeovers,overseas acquisitions and joint ventures. Apart from attracting Fortune 500companies to open shops in India, Indian corporates are making their ownplaces in the list at scales which was hitherto unimaginable.Significant Policy DevelopmentsKeeping in view the robustness of the external sector, a number of far-reaching changes have been effected in a phased manner in the recent yearsto liberalise the capital account, which include more flexible and liberalinvestments norms in order to promote Indian investment abroad and toenable Indian companies to reap the benefits of globalization and becomeglobally competitive. The other measures relate to allowing two-way fungibilityin the case of GDRs / ADRs, permission to Indian mutual funds to invest inoverseas equity market subject to certain limits, permission to Indiancompanies to make acquisitions of foreign companies or make directinvestment abroad in Joint Ventures/Wholly- owned Subsidiaries, permissionto various participants in the foreign exchange market, including FIIs, to availforward cover subject to genuine underlying exposure, permission to residentsto open foreign currency denominated account, etcAlongside the measures taken to encourage overseas investment byresident corporates, steps were taken to contain and calibrate debt-creatinginflows.  The thrust of the new ECB policy is to encourage investment in thereal sector and infrastructure while at the same time restricting debt flows forpurposes other than those adding to the capital stock.RBI also encouraged the setting up of CCIL to reduce settlement risk. CCILhas functioned as an efficient enabler of settlement offering netting andoperational benefits, in addition to substantial risk mitigation. CCIL settledover 900,000 deals for a gross volume of USD 900 billion in the last yearalone.Issues for the road aheadThe Report of the Internal Technical Group on Forex Markets, set upby the RBI and announced last year at the same  conference, has madevarious recommendations for further liberalization of the extant  regulations.Some of the recommendations, such as, freedom to cancel and rebookforward contracts of any tenor, delegation of powers to ADs for grant ofpermission to corporates to hedge their exposure to commodity price risk inthe international commodity exchanges/ markets and extension of the tradinghours of the inter-bank foreign exchange market have already beenimplemented.  The Reserve Bank has placed the report in the public domainfor comments and the feedback received will be taken into consideration forarriving at a final decision in this regard.Greater liberalisation requires banks to act responsibly in order toprovide confidence to corporate entities going in for derivative transactions inaddition to satisfying regulations. In this context, customer suitability andappropriateness issue has assumed significance. The “appropriatenessstandard” ensures that banks use the same principles for taking creditdecisions in respect of complex derivative transactions as they do for non-derivative transactions. Banks are expected to evaluate the purpose of thederivative transaction and make an assessment as to whether it isappropriate to the customer’s needs and level of sophistication. While somebanks already have an appropriateness policy in place, many banks do not.Instances of international banks encountering compensation claims due toslackness on their part in this area are well known. It is, therefore, importantthat all banks introduce a customer suitability and appropriateness policy.Further, greater clarity is required in the area of derivative accountingin the books of corporates as well as banks in regard to revenue recognitionand valuation of assets and liabilities. In general it may be a desirablepractice to have  convergence in the accounting standards for both foreigncurrency and INR derivatives and between on balance sheet and off balancesheet items. There is also need to eliminate incentives to drive a wedgebetween on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Clarity is essential  todifferentiate between hedge and trading transactions. In respect oftransactions classified as trading, and hence marked to market, an importantissue that needs to be addressed is whether there is a liquid market for theseproducts. If not, what should be a prudent approach for recognizing incomeor losses. RBI is in the process of compiling a master circular on allderivatives including issues related to accounting and valuation for banks inconsultation with industry associations and the ICAI. We also welcomesuggestions from the Forex Association in this regard.However, there is equal need and urgency to formulate accountingstandards for interest rate and certain foreign currency derivatives for allcorporates. Indian accounting standards are still in formative stage asregards derivative accounting both in regard to hedge and fair value/ cashflow accounting as well as coverage of the products.  ICAI is seized of theissue and it is important that the forex association also facilitates the processby providing suggestions to the Institute.In the context of good corporate governance, the issue of greaterdisclosure on the part of banks and corporates has become important. In thecase of complex structured products, it is imperative on the part of the banks/ corporates to be transparent and disclose the nature and quantum of riskscontracted and the systems put in place to monitor these risks.While accounting and disclosure issues are engaging our attention,the RBI is also examining other recommendations of the Technical Group forphased implementation. One of the recommendations relates to coveredoptions. As things stand, the corporates are only allowed to purchase optionssupported by genuine underlying transaction/receivable. Any structuredproduct involving cost reduction is allowed provided it does not increaseunderlying risk and there is no  net receipt of premium. Covered options,allow the corporates to write covered calls and puts subject to adequate riskmanagement systems being in place. This is expected to impart greaterdepth and liquidity to the options market and provide greater flexibility to themarket participants.Similarly, we propose to revisit the procedures in respect ofcrystallization of unpaid export bills which were formulated long ago. Anotherrecommendation of the Group relates to price fix hedge. Currently, residentsengaged in import/export activity can hedge the price risk of thesecommodities in international commodity exchanges. The suggestion is toallow price fix hedges to the extent of the average quantity of commoditybought/sold during the previous three years, or during the previous year,whichever is higher. This would be applicable both to commodities imported/exported and procured domestically. RBI welcomes inputs from the ForexAssociation in regard to the recommendations under examination.A proposal from CCIL to extend guaranteed settlement of US$/INRforward transactions from trade date is being currently examined by us. Sincesettlement guarantee will extend from the trade date, we expect the liquidityand depth in the forward market to increase significantly. The risks that bankstoday carry on their books on account of large outstanding forward positionswill be significantly reduced.Let me now turn to the G-Sec market.III. G-Sec marketAs a debt manager to the Government, the development of a deep andliquid market for Government securities is of critical importance to theReserve Bank as  this would  result in better price discovery and reduce  thecost of Government borrowing. Such markets also provide an effectivetransmission mechanism for monetary policy, facilitate the introduction andpricing of hedging products and serve as benchmarks for other debtinstruments. Efforts towards development of the Government securitiesmarket have focused on three areas: institutional measures, innovationsthrough instruments, and enabling measures. As a result of gradual reformmeasures taken over the years, the Indian G-Sec market has seen atransition for the better, as reflected in  the following developments:• the market has become increasingly broad based.• consolidation of securities, albeit in a passive manner, has resultedin the development of  several  benchmark securities,• a high degree of sophistication achieved in the auction process hasnarrowed the gap between the cut-off price and the weightedaverage cut-off price and has resulted in a strong correlationbetween the bids at the primary auction  and secondary marketyields, indicating improved price discovery.• the increased volume of trading in the secondary market hasresulted in a reasonably smooth yield curve;• the yield curve  has been elongated up to 30 years maturity toreduce bunching of redemptions and minimise the rollover risk;• through a process of novation, a central counterparty, like theClearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) has provided excellentinfrastructure and contributed to better risk management.• to address important issues regarding  pricing,  choice ofbenchmark, and liquidity in respect of floating rate bonds (FRBs),  aSub-Group of the Technical Advisory Committee on Money, Forexand Government securities markets has been constituted.• RBI has enhanced the efficacy of NDS by incorporating screenbased anonymous order matching system under its ambit witheffect from August 1, 2005.Given this backdrop, let me now turn to some of the recommendationsmade by the Technical Group on Government Securities which are underexamination.  First, since RBI would not be able to participate in the primary auctionmarket with effect from 2006-07, an internal Technical Group in RBI examinedand recommended an appropriately restructured primary issuance process.The Technical Group suggested that Primary Dealers(PDs) may have to takeup a greater role in underwriting and may accordingly need to underwrite 100per cent of the notified amounts in future auctions.Second, the larger responsibility cast on the PDs may need to becompensated with appropriate incentives and one of the suggestions is toextend exclusivity in auctions, which is a typical feature in most countries withPD system. However, another view is that this may disadvantage otherplayers in the Government securities market who have been participatingdirectly in auctions.Third, PDs are also required to play the role of  market-makers by alwaysoffering two-way quotes, thereby imparting  liquidity. However, it has beenrepresented that the absence of short sales constrains the market-making roleof PDs. The issue for consideration is whether short sales, with appropriatesafeguards  would be necessary for PDs to play this role of market-making.Fourth, a numbers of challenges have emerged in monetary and debtmanagement: To meet the emerging challenges, the Reserve Bank is takingsteps to fine-tune its open market operations. This would need greateraccuracy in forecasting market liquidity over the short- to medium-term.Operationally, open market purchases and sales may have to be undertaken,necessitating a review of processes and technical infrastructure consistentwith market development.Other recommendations made by the Group to further develop theefficiency and liquidity of secondary market for Government securities  include(i) active consolidation of securities, (ii) introduction of a ‘When Issued’ marketin a phased manner, and (iv) a securities borrowing window for PDs.As per the announcement in the Union Budget 2005-06, a Bill to amendthe RBI Act,1934 for providing, among other things,   legality to OTCderivatives  has been introduced in the Parliament. Similarly, the GovernmentSecurities Bill seeks to broaden the market for Government securities byfacilitating retail interest while also ensuring an orderly secondary market.Some of the substantive improvements expected  in the management ofpublic debt on account of this  Bill are: (i) stripping and reconstitution ofGovernment securities to facilitate improved secondary market liquidity, onthe one hand and to enable better risk allocation in the appropriate investorclass, on the other, (ii) provision for hypothecation, pledge and creation of lienon Government securities, etc.Let me now turn to money market.IV. Money MarketThe money market forms an important part of the financial system byproviding an avenue for equilibrating the surplus funds of lenders and therequirements of borrowers for short periods. It also provides a focal point forcentral bank’s intervention for influencing the liquidity in the financial systemand thereby transmitting the monetary policy impulses. The primary aim ofthe Reserve Bank’s operations in the money market is to ensure that theliquidity and short-term interest rates are maintained at levels consistent withthe monetary policy objectives. In recent years, the Reserve Bank’s approachhas been to foster balanced development of different segments of the moneymarket, introduce new instruments, reduce dependence of participants onuncollateralised exposures, facilitate price discovery in the short-end andupgrade the payment system infrastructure. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank’sstrategy has focused on developing pure call/ notice money market,instituting full-fledged Liquidity Adjustment Facility(LAF), developinginfrastructure, promoting transparency, and various measures pertaining toinstruments for non-bank participants. The following are some of theimportant developments pertaining to the money market:• With a view to transforming the call/ notice money market into a pureinter-bank market with participation of banks and primary dealers (PDs)only, a phased exit of non-banks from the call/notice money marketwas started in May 2001. With effect from August 6, 2005, non-bankparticipants have been completely phased out of the call moneymarket.• Several new financial instruments have been introduced. Thetraditional refinance support on fixed terms has been replaced by a full-fledged Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was introduced on June 5,2000 with a view to modulating short-term liquidity under diversemarket conditions.•  The development of the payment system infrastructure wasstrengthened with the introduction of the Negotiated Dealing System(NDS) in February 2002, formation of the Clearing Corporation of IndiaLtd. (CCIL) in 2001, and the implementation of Real Time GrossSettlement (RTGS) system in March 2004• Measures have also been taken to make various other money marketinstruments (such as CDs, CPs, etc.) freely accessible to non-bankparticipants. These measures were intended to improve the  depth ofas well as   the efficiency and transparency of operations   in themoney market.• As part of the development of  new instruments, a major initiativepertains to Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO),which was operationalised as a money market instrument throughCCIL on January 20, 2003. With a view to developing the market forthe CBLO, the Reserve Bank allowed certain exemptions in the form ofCRR relaxation.V. Interaction between Forex, Government Securities and MoneyMarketsThe far-reaching financial sector reforms have also facilitated India’smovement to an open economy framework in which interaction between forex,Government securities and money market has become quite important. Theopening of the economy has brought about gains in terms of inflows of foreigninvestments, which have contributed to growth and employment. However,these gains have also posed new challenges for managing themacroeconomy amidst large and volatile capital flows.  This has hadimplications for monetary management. We have addressed this challengewith appropriate monetary-fiscal coordination. Suitable changes were made inthe LAF scheme and MSS was introduced to address more enduring portionof the liquidity overhang.In view of the growing integration of markets across borders, it isimperative that domino effects are minimised by refining and upgrading thefinancial infrastructure in all its vital components, such as accountingstandards, including income recognition and provisioning norms, disclosurestandards  and insolvency laws.  This upgradation is  to be attained inconformity with international best practices. In this regard, the Reserve Bankhas strengthened the consultative process for all major policy steps in atransparent manner by involving  market participants and other experts.VII. Concluding ObservationsThe reforms have been successful in bringing significant improvements invarious financial market segments improving their depth, liquidity andefficiency. The money market is now reasonably developed with a wide  arrayof instruments. The character of the Government securities market haschanged from being  a captive market to a broad-based, deep and liquidmarket enabling the Reserve Bank to pursue its monetary policy throughmarket-based instruments. Various reform measures have resulted in sharpgrowth of the foreign exchange market. Reforms have also been successful increating and sustaining orderly conditions in the market. These factors haveled to increased inter-linkages across financial institutions and markets. In themore recent period, the various segments of the  financial market in Indiahave, by and large, exhibited stability.RBI will endeavour to provide an enabling environment for healthydevelopment of financial markets. The enabling environment alsoencompasses harmonization of reforms in financial sector with the real sector.Large gaps exist in demand supply of infrastructure services such astransport, electricity, ports etc. It needs to be emphasized that soundmacroeconomic policies and a competitive domestic sector improve thecapacity of the economy to absorb higher capital inflows, reduce the cost ofcapital, translate external flows into higher investment levels and providecushion against unexpected shocks in more liberalized external markets.With progressive financial sector reforms, various segments of thefinancial market, including Forex, money and G-Sec markets, have madetremendous strides. While we have come a long way from the controlledregime of the yester years, we believe in following a gradualist approach toopening up. A calibrated approach towards financial sector liberalization hasbeen the hallmark of financial sector reforms process and has paid richdividends to the economy by insulating it from the vagaries of internationalcapital flows and the contagion effect of various crises faced by emergingmarket economies in the 1990s. Let me conclude by thanking the Associationfor giving me this opportunity. I am sure the deliberations in this conferencewill be quite useful and I wish the conference all success.Thank You.
