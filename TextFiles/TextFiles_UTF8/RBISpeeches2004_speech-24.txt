These reforms enabled a systematic process for integration of the different segments of the domestic markets as well as some integration of the domestic financial markets with the international markets. This also shows that development of a debt market is a difficult and long drawn out process and requires active cooperation between different institutions.  It would be appropriate at this stage to look at certain specific achievements in the last 10 years. The increasing share of Government securities in A.

The securities has become (Charts 1 and 2).  With increasing most important development to have taken place in recent reliance on market borrowing as a source of deficit years is the marked deterioration in public sector savings, financing over the years, the level of gross market which have turned negative and fallen from a level of borrowing exceeded the fiscal deficit for the first time in 1.3 per cent of GDP as recently as in 1997-98 to -2.5 2002-03.  The high fiscal deficit and revenue deficits have per cent in 2001-02, as against a positive 1.8 per cent of necessitated large borrowing by the central government, GDP during the high growth phase of 1995-1997 and leading to an appreciable increase in the total stock of 1.5 per cent in 1990-92. This reflects deteriorating fiscal outstanding securities (Table 3).  This level of domestic performance compounded by inadequate returns to past market borrowing is unusual among developing countries. public investment financed by borrowing. Although the Indian (Centre and States combined) fiscal The primary issuance of Central Government debt has deficit has been among the highest in the world, we have increased manifold during the decade of the 1990s from Rs. 89 billion in 1991-92 to Rs.1,511 billion in 2002-03. The issuance of the state government debt has also increased 9 times during the corresponding period from Rs.34 billion to Rs.309 billion. The increasing funds requirement of the government was met through an increasing domestic private savings rate which predominantly funded the growing borrowing needs of the government.

The thrust of policy initiatives in this direction is focused on developing the retail segment of the market. To enable small and medium sized investors to participate in the primary auction of government securities, a Scheme of Non Competitive Bidding was introduced in January 2002, which is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity prescribed by RBI. The scheme provides for allocation of up to 5 per cent of the notified amount at the weighted average rate of accepted bids. Investors can bid through banks or PDs a minimum amount of Rs.10,000 to a maximum amount of Rs. 20 million. A few PDs have already introduced schemes for retail marketing of Government securities using the network of bank branches and post offices.

Elongation of the Maturity Profile of New Debt and Reduction in the Cost of Borrowing For most of the 1990s, the maturity of Central government issuance ranged up to 10 years. This led to potential redemption pressure and refinancing risk. objectives of elongating the maturity profile of new This, as also the need to develop the yield curve for debt (Chart 4 and Table 6), and reducing the cost of longer tenors, has necessitated elongation of maturity borrowing at the same time (Chart 5).

Thus the key requirement for the Indian placements, the issue acquires lot of significance. capital market is the development of a vibrant bond market. B. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORPORATE D EBT MARKET Developing a corporate debt market has been found to be much more difficult than either the equity market The regulatory authority for the corporate debt market or the government securities market in all countries, is the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) so developed or developing. It is difficult to develop adequate I will only make some general remarks on the liquidity for trading since there is a much greater development of this market. heterogeneity in corporate debt issues relative to either While the G-sec market is now fairly well-developed, the equity market or the government securities market. the corporate debt market needs to be developed so that As we have seen, even in the G-Sec market, only a India can have a well-integrated financial market. Apart minority of instruments are found to have adequate from the advantages that it confers for long-term liquidity. financing, an integrated financial market is necessary for Furthermore, in developing countries, there is generally efficient transmission of monetary policy. The foundations a lack of good quality issues, a lack of institutional for developing an efficient corporate debt market have investors, and inadequate legal, regulatory and already been laid as the necessary infrastructure and technological supporting infrastructure.  It is also found institutions that have been created for the G-sec market that corporate entities generally prefer to borrow from are already available. The RBI and SEBI have also taken banks and financial institutions since cost of bond a number of initiatives to ensure that this market develops issuance is high and renegotiation is difficult.  Moreover, in a transparent and safe manner. Recent initiatives include in developing countries, the market is generally announcing guidelines on trading and listing requirements fragmented and small, hence it is difficult to achieve for corporate debt by SEBI and asking banks to invest anonymity. only in listed and rated corporate paper by the RBI. In India, however, a number of pre-conditions have As I have already mentioned, with the passing of the been met or are in the process of being met.  First, there Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, the is a well functioning government securities market with Government would be required to reduce its deficit which adequate benchmark issues; the regulatory and legal in turn would result in a reduced market borrowing infrastructure is in place; clearing and settlement systems programme. The reduced availability of G-secs will force have been developed; and technological infrastructure is banks to look for alternate investment avenues. Further, also in place with the implementation of RTGS.  Second, the economy being on a high growth path would create the money market is also working relatively efficiently higher demand for funds, especially in infrastructure. With so that the transmission of monetary policy can be term lending from financial institutions on the decline, effective.  Third, with decline in inflation since the late the corporate funding needs, especially for infrastructure, 1990s, inflationary expectations have been tempered, would necessarily have to be met by the bond market. interest rates have fallen and have been relatively stable. The infrastructure projects irrespective of the sectoral Fourth, the last decade has also been the emergence of characteristics have high leverage ratios.  Not only is the credible credit rating agencies. Fifth, with improved initial recourse to debt funding very high for infrastructure regulation of equity markets and enhanced attention to investments, but the subsequent expansion, renovation or corporate governance, public disclosure of corporate modernisation are also funded substantially through debt balance sheets has improved considerably with proper financing.  It is clear that there would be a huge gap accounting, auditing and disclosure rules.  Thus the stage between investment demand and the supply of financial is set for the emergence of a well functioning corporate resources.  While some of the traditional modes of debt market. financing infrastructure  project financing from banks and financial institutions, raising equity from the capital What are some of the other pre-conditions that still markets and foreign direct investment  would continue, need greater attention?  First although there has been some the magnitude of the gap between the demand and supply progress in the enforcement of creditors rights, the legal 1025 1025November Reserve Bank of India Bulletin 2004 and regulatory system still has a long way to go in this number of non-profit organisations and trusts who need area.

Finally, there any compensation from defaulting companies.  Second, are now more than 35 cities with more than one million the interest rate derivatives market is in its infancy and population and almost 40 others with more than 100,000 needs greater development for the easy access of hedging population, so there is an increasing mass of retail instruments to bond investors.  Third, brokerage systems investors waiting to be tapped. for retailing of either government securities or corporate So the conditions are ripe for the development of debt instruments have yet to develop.  What the retail the corporate debt market in India.

IV. CONCLUSIONS Even after the various reforms proposed for developing a corporate debt market are put in place, it may be We have come a long way in the government securities difficult to actually issue long-term debt instruments since market in fostering a deep and liquid G-Sec market and borrowing agencies may not have high enough credit in the process we have learned a lot.  The process has quality to go to the market. Also given the risks associated been easier in this market since the Reserve Bank is the with infrastructure projects, considerable effort needs to issuer of government securities, is a participant in this be undertaken to mitigate these risks and provide greater market, and is also the regulator of this market.  As the comfort to investors.  In view of the long maturities of monetary authority its actions in this market also provide infrastructure financing, credit enhancement would be interest rate signals.  Consequently, the Reserve Bank took required to raise long-term debt. This would need upon itself the task of developing the market infrastructure institutional innovations such as bond insurance, provision to ensure safety in the settlements and payments systems. of guarantees, securitisation of assets and the like. The development of the market was also aided by the The potential for developing an active and deep debt fact that the underlying instruments, government market is high.

Apart from the large variance of like who could potentially issue bonds for infrastructure risk in underlying instruments, it involves various issues financing, if they can become credit worthy.  With the such as a good and transparent trading infrastructure, increasing role of the private sector in infrastructure, there settlement and clearing by other linked organizations, can also be a large number of private sector issuers. money market intermediaries and the like.   The Furthermore, with Indian industry exhibiting a new motivation for the development of the government competitiveness, there is likely to be a resurgence of IPOs, securities market was the expansion in government that will need to be supplemented with matching borrowing coinciding with the cessation of automatic magnitudes of fund raising through debt instruments and monetisation. Now, the private sector borrowing needs loans.  On the investors side, as more private insurance are likely to expand and hence development of the companies enter the market and expand, and pension corporate bond market will require focused attention.
