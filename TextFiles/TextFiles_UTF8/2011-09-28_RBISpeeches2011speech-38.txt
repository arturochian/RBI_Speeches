Measures aimed at strengthening financial system resilience. Buttress monetary policy by potentially preventing sharp financial disruptions Facilitate smoother transmission of monetary policy .While Monetary policy Ensures efficient allocation of resources  key to financial stability Can play a role in restoration of stability in the midst of a crisis .But there could be trade offs as well Stable prices and low interest rates can incentivize under pricing of  risks Financial stability considerations involve a longer policy horizon than price  stability .which will need to be carefully managed In any case, the central bank around the world are reconsidering their pure inflation targeting status 9 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 The evolving role  of central banks Price and Financial Stability Systemic approach to policy and micro- prudential policy Sovereign debt management, monetary  policy and financial stability Managing Capital Flows Accumulation of reserves Liquidity management Ensuring safety and security of Payment and  Settlement Systems (PSS) 10 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Systemic approach to policy.. Pre-crisis regulation focused more on stability of individual institutions Crisis under-scored the importance of focusing on systemic stability Time dimension of systemic risks or pro-cyclicality Cross sectional dimensions of systemic risks or the build up common  exposures and risk concentrations and of interconnectedness between key  financial sector entities . A leap from bottoms up to a systemic approach! Strong complementarities between macro and micro prudential policy  frameworks Tools are broadly the same Significant elements of the emerging macro prudential framework, post crisis,  use prudential tools to address systemic risks Core capital prescriptions Leverage ratio Expected loss provisioning through the cycle methodologies,  etc. 11 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 ..and potential trade offs Notwithstanding the synergies, the policies  Serve two different purposes . Potential for conflict arise during a crisis Macro-prudential policy  warrants release of countercyclical  buffers Micro-prudential policy  warrants that banks remain as well  capitalized as possible Are used by different authorities in different jurisdictions Continuous interaction and exchange of information  mandatory  if the policies rest in different institutions. But conflict resolution easier if both policies rest in the same institutions  as is being increasingly realized internationally  12 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 The Indian experience Pursuit of Financial Stability  Not an explicitly stated objective under the Reserve Bank statute  but an explicit policy objective (since 2004)  The broad compulsions of financial stability Have, however, driven all major policy initiatives since the  balance of payment crisis in the 1990s and have guided the pace  and intensity of financial liberalization in the economy in, inter  alia, Banking Sector and Non-banking financial sector Management of the capital account Development of financial markets and infrastructure Are evident in the Reserve Banks regulatory approach and  orientation Increasing the resilience of Financial  Institutions All leveraged entities (banks and non-banks) within the Reserve  Banks regulatory framework A gradual process of introduction of reforms in the banking sector  a case  study in increasing resilience in a non-disruptive manner The sequence followed: A prudential framework Interest rate deregulation and lowering of statutory preemptions Accounting reforms  Good governance through fit and proper owners, directors and senior  managers The non-banking financial sector brought within regulatory ambit through statutory amendments in the late 1990s Initial focus on depositor protection Later, a prudential regulatory framework put in place for systemically important  non-deposit taking entities as well A framework for monitoring of financial conglomerates is in place since  2004 14 Istanbul Finance Summit 30 September 2011 Addressing systemic risks A macroprudential hue to the Reserve Banks policy  framework has been evident though not christened as such Time dimensions of systemic risks sought to be addressed  since 2004 through a series of macroprudential measures  including time varying risk weights and provisions Possible risks arising from inter-connectedness taken on  board Prudential limits on aggregate inter-bank liabilities Higher risk weights on investments by banks in subordinated debts of  other banks Restricted access to overnight un-collateralized funds Exposure limits between banks and non-banking financial companies 15 Istanbul Finance Summit 30 September 2011 Systemic risk identification.. (1) Continuous assessment of the financial system to identify and  assess burgeoning risks in the financial sector is build into the  operating framework of the Reserve Bank In 2010, a dedicated Financial Stability Unit was set up to, inter  alia,  conduct macroprudential supervision of the economy on  a continuing basis The Bank has also started publishing half yearly Financial  Stability Reports in an effort to communicate its assessment  of risks to financial stability to all stakeholders More frequent assessments are prepared internally  16 Istanbul Finance Summit 30 September 2011 Systemic risk identification.. (2) Several initiatives in the Reserve Bank are aimed at  continuously assessing the financial system so that any  emerging risks can be identified and dealt with at an early stage. A Financial Stress Indicator - a contemporaneous indicator of  conditions in financial markets and in the banking sector.  Systemic Liquidity Indicator for assessing systemic liquidity A Fiscal Stress Indicator for assessing fiscal risks A network model of the bilateral exposures in the financial system   for assessing the inter-connectedness in the system A Banking Stability Indicator for assessing risk factors having a  bearing on the stability of the banking sector  A series of Banking Stability Measures for assessing the systemic  importance of individual banks.  17 Istanbul Finance Summit 30 September 2011 The evolving role  of central banks Price and Financial Stability Systemic approach to policy and micro- prudential policy Sovereign debt management, monetary  policy and financial stability Managing Capital Flows Accumulation of reserves Liquidity management Ensuring safety and security of Payment and  Settlement Systems (PSS) 18 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Sovereign debt management, monetary  policy and financial stability The GFC has brought to the fore synergies and potential conflicts on interest  between central banks role as monetary authority and systemic  regulator and its role as manager of public debt..  Triggering academic rethinking in favour of debt management  by central banks It is being increasingly realized that Debt management is much more than a mere resource raising  exercise, especially in an EME context Independent debt management could jeopardize monetary and  financial stability Independent Debt Management Offices are not necessarily a  panacea and also raise issues of coordination. 19 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 The Indian experience SDM with the Reserve Bank of India  A confluence of interest The perceived conflict between SDM and policies for price and  financial stability found to be hugely overstated in the Indian context. . On the contrary,  balancing the objectives of growth with price and financial stability with SDM  enabled the Reserve Bank to fulfil a huge government borrowing  programme in  a non-disruptive manner; To increase the maturity profile of government debt and to elongate sovereign  yield curve while ensuring that the  Has facilitated capital account management The Market Stabilization Scheme Resolving conflicts with policies for price and financial stability The FRBM Act Central bank should take over or at least be involved/consulted for SDM even in the  developed world (Goodhart (2010)/Fischer (2010)) 20 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 The evolving role  of central banks Price and Financial Stability Systemic approach to policy and micro- prudential policy Sovereign debt management, monetary  policy and financial stability Managing Capital Flows Accumulation of reserves Liquidity management Ensuring safety and security of Payment and  Settlement Systems (PSS) 21 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Capital flows  a double edged sword Resource constrained Emerging Economies value capital flows There remains risks from such flows in a closely interconnected  world as strongly demonstrated by the financial crisis Sudden reversals / volatility in flows especially if the composition of  flows is skewed towards portfolio flows Risks of inflows concentrated in sensitive sectors like real estate  leading to asset price bubbles Challenges have been accentuated by recent policies in some  advances economies - Quantitative easing and stimulus policies to  support ailing economies, Leading to increased flows to EMEs 22 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 A menu of policy options EMEs are resource constrained and value capital flows How to benefit from the flows without stress of reversals?

The crisis, nevertheless, brought into focus the  importance of the smooth functioning of such  infrastructure 31 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Indian experience Payment and settlement systems in India within the  regulatory perimeter of the central bank Vide the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 Many of the post crisis reforms being contemplated  already envisaged Settlement of all inter bank transactions in central bank money Introduction of CCP settlement for foreign exchange,  government securities, interest rate markets, equity and  commodity Trade reporting requirements for OTC derivative trades  already introduced and being strengthened  Credit derivatives on the anvil albeit with safeguards 32 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 The emerging regulatory infrastructure  Relationship of the central banks with the  government and other agencies  The central banks autonomy, accountability and  governance 33 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Regulatory infrastructure  for  financial stability Sweeping changes to the regulatory infrastructure for  financial stability since the financial crisis have Designated the central bank as the systemic regulator with  accountability;  Placed central banks in charge of micro-prudential regulation, where  not already so responsible, in addition to macro-prudential  regulation; and Set up financial stability councils/commissions to provide high level  focus on financial stability. Irrespective of the emerging regulatory contours, central  banks are expected to occupy a pivotal role in the pursuit  of financial stability 34 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Financial stability  a shared  objective The importance of inter regulatory and inter agency  coordination in a financial stability framework is critical The crisis threw up scores of illustrations of the need for  better coordination between different agencies with a stake  in financial stability  central banks, prudential regulators,  supervisors, securities and other financial sector regulators,  the government Post crisis infrastructural reforms (e.g. financial stability  councils) are aimed at addressing this need but continuing  interaction and information exchange at both the policy and  operational levels will be critical if we are to avert another  financial crisis 35 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 The Role of the Fiscal in Financial  Stability and Central Bank Autonomy The crisis has underscored the role of the fiscal in financial  stability in conjunction with central banks Fiscal policy plays a supporting role in a financial stability framework,  especially for crisis management and resolution.  Automatic fiscal stabilisers can facilitate financial stability  though the fiscal can also work at cross purposes with the  financial stability framework  Unsustainable deficit levels  the Sovereign Debt Crisis Aspects of fiscal policy  e.g. the taxation policy and subsidy structures,  could inadvertently facilitate or incentivise build up of excesses.  T hi s  has  Raised issues of central banks governance and accountability Especially with the setting up of financial stability councils involving  the Government/ Treasury 36 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 The Role of the Fiscal in Financial  Stability and Central Bank Autonomy The case for autonomy of the monetary authority is  well established It is less accepted but equally compelling for central  banks with a mandate for financial stability A macroprudentialists mandate  to take away the  punch bowl especially if systemic fault lines appear  in good times Opens the gates for greater political interventions The need for central banks accountability is  unquestioned  But there are issues with designing a  quantifiable accountability framework for financial  stability 37 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Indian experience A High Level Coordination Committee on Financial  Markets (HLCCFM) chaired by Governor Operational since 1992 Includes financial sector regulators and key government  departments A Financial Stability and Development Council (2010) Focused attention on financial stability, macroprudential  supervision of the economy, inter regulatory coordination Finance Minister in the Chair Governor, Reserve Bank, in the chair of the Councils Sub  Committee  its main operating arm The Sub-Committee has since replaced the HLCCFM 38 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011Challenges and Way Ahead 39 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Challenges and Way Ahead.. Several challenges have emerged during and in the aftermath of  the global financial crisis and many more will emerge as the  global reforms agenda unfolds and is implemented  Implementation of a macroprudential policy framework  Challenges in calibrating the countercyclical buffers especially in EMEs where  the credit to GDP ratio (advocated by the Basel Committee) may not be a  reliable indicator for the purpose Plugging data gaps and shortcomings in existing information systems Greater international co-operation and co-ordination For promoting open, flexible and resilient international financial system Recognizing spill-over between economies   Co-ordinating the implementation of the global reforms agenda Greater transparency in communication and fostering credibility of  policy actions and strengthening the confidence channel 40 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011 Challenges and WayAhead The period leading up to the crisis saw central banks at the peak of their  credibility and reputation An elongated period of the Great Moderation meant that the central banks thought  they had discovered the holy grail and declared victory The credibility and the reputation of central banks have been a little tarnished  during the crisis  With central banks being, as they were, blamed for getting the world into the crisis  Notwithstanding, the critical role of central banks in fostering financial stability  was recognised and, world over,  The mandates of central banks are being strengthened to give them a greater role in the  emerging framework for financial stability For central bankers like us  the way forward is both a challenge and an  opportunity A challenge to rise up to & deliver on greater responsibilities being entrusted to us An opportunity to retrieve, to its fullest extent and beyond, our credibility and  reputation as an institutional body, par excellence 41 Istanbul Finance Summit 2011Thank you
