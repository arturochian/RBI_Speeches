Development of Bond Market in India(Mohammad Tahir, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India)IntroductionBond markets link issuers, i.e., governments, state owned institutions, local bodies andcorporates having financing needs, with investors having investible surplus. An efficient bondmarket is one where the requirements of both issuers and investors are met effectively at a price(interest rates) determined competitively, and where price adjustment to new information isseamless. For this purpose, the basic pre-requisites are: stable macro-economic environment,absence or minimal presence of administered rates, a wide issuer and investor base (whichensures adequate size and activity in the market), intermediaries, infrastructure for smooth andsafe trading and settlement of trades, and an enabling regulatory and legal environment.Government bond markets play an important role insofar as they provide the benchmarkyield curve, on the basis of which most other debt instruments are priced. This paper presents thedevelopment of the bond markets in India. I will also briefly deal with the corporate debt market.An Overview of Debt Market in IndiaThere are three main segments of debt market in India, viz., Government securities,Public Sector Units (PSU) bonds and private sector corporate bonds.India being a federal state, Government securities are issued by Central Government andall the provincial Governments (India has 28 states), although in case of the latter such securitiesconstitute a relatively small portion of their fiscal deficits. In India, banks are required tomaintain statutorily a certain percentage of their liabilities in Government securities and otherspecified liquid assets which creates a captive demand for Government securities. At present, theStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) for banks is 25 per cent. Similar statutory requirements invarying degrees are there for other type of financial institutions, viz., insurance companies,provident funds, non-banking financial institutions etc.The PSU bonds are generally treated as surrogates of sovereign paper, sometimes due toexplicit guarantee of Government, and often due to the comfort of public ownership.  Some ofthe PSU bonds are tax free, a status not enjoyed even by Government securities.Corporate bonds and debentures have maturities beyond 1 year and generally up to 10years. Corporates also issue short-term commercial paper with maturity ranging from 15 days toone year.The matrix of issuers, investors, instruments in the debt market and their maturities arepresented in Table 1.Table 1: Participants and Products in Debt marketIssuer Instrument Maturity Major InvestorsCentral Government Dated Securities 2-30 years RBI, Banks, InsuranceTreasury Bills 91/364 days Companies, ProvidentFunds, Mutual Funds,PDs, IndividualsState Government Dated Securities 5-10 years Banks, InsuranceCompanies, ProvidentFundsPSUs (Centre and Bonds 5-10 years Banks, Insurance2States) Companies, Corporate,Provident Funds, MutualFunds, IndividualsCorporates Bonds and 1-12 years Banks, Mutual Funds,Debentures Corporates, IndividualsCommercial Paper 15 days to1 yearPDs Commercial Paper 15 days to1 year Banks, Corporate,Financial Institutions,Mutual Funds,IndividualsBanks Bonds issued for minimum 5 years Banks, CorporatesTier II capitalCertificates of 3 months to 1 yearDeposit,Size of Debt MarketIn India, Government securities market is the overwhelming part of the overall debtmarket, in terms of both outstanding securities, and trading volumes. The total outstanding debt*amounts to Rs.8,500 billion and forms 37% of GDP.  Of this, Central Government datedsecurities as on March 31, 2002 amounted to Rs.5,363 billion (23 per cent of GDP) and that ofState governments to Rs.1,040 billion (4.5 per cent of GDP). According to informed estimates,PSU Bonds/Private Corporate bonds amount to about Rs.2,000 billion (9 per cent of GDP). Thus,nearly three-fourth of debt instruments is accounted for by Government.  Incidentally, the#present market capitalization of corporate equities is placed at Rs. 6,300 billion . Of the PSU/Corporate debt estimated at Rs. 2,000 billion, about 30 per cent is listed on stock exchanges andabout 30 per cent held by banks. During 2001-02, the Central Government raised gross marketborrowings of Rs.1,142 billion (4.9 per cent of GDP) through marketable dated securities, whileState Governments raised Rs.187 billion.Table 2: Resources Raised from Debt Markets(Excluding Treasury Bills)(Rs. billion)Issuer 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02Corporate 658 711 710Public Issues 45 33 61Private Placement* 613 678 649Government 1,133 1,285 1,329Total 1,791 1,996 2039(as % to GDP) (9.3) (9.6) (8.8)* Includes equity issues of insignificant amount.                                                3The dominance of the Government securities in the secondary market is even more as itaccounts for more than 90% of the transactions. Average daily transaction volume in thesecondary market for government securities during 2001-02 is about Rs.40 billion whereas thatfor corporate securities including PSUs is only about Rs. 2 to 4 billion. Among the governmentsecurities, a very large bulk of volume is accounted for by Central government securities. Theturnover ratio (total transaction volume during the year as a multiple of outstanding stock) wasabout 2.7 for the year 2001-02, as compared with 1.6 in 2000-01 and 0.8 in 1995-96 (Table 3).Table 3: Secondary Market Transactions in Central Government Securities(Rs.

Coordination with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is ensured bothat a policy level and at operational level. In particular, at a policy level, coordination is ensuredthrough a High Level Committee on Capital Markets presided by Governor, RBI, and consistingof Chairman, SEBI, Chairman, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) andFinance Secretary, Government of India. The Deputy Governor of RBI is on the Board ofDirectors of SEBI. Further, the Standing RBI – SEBI Technical Committee consisting ofofficials from RBI and SEBI assists the HLCC at an operational level. Currently, amongst otherthings, RBI and SEBI are working together to devise a regulating mechanism for the issuers ofprivate placements which will address issues of quality, transparency, end-use of funds andlisting of such bonds.The trading of government securities on the Stock exchanges is currently throughnegotiated dealing using members of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)/National Stock Exchange(NSE) and these trades are required to be reported to the exchange. All the 23 stock exchanges inthe country provide facility for trading in corporate debt instruments. The bulk of the corporatebonds, being privately placed, are, however, not listed on stock exchanges. Two Depositories,National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited(CDSL) maintain records of holding of securities in a dematerialised form. Records of holding of4government securities for wholesale dealers like banks/PDs and other financial institutions are1maintained at the RBI .Government Securities MarketPre-Reform period Government Securities MarketIn India, fiscal policy compulsions rendered internal debt management before 1991-92passive. To keep government borrowing costs down, low coupon rates were offered ongovernment securities, which made real rates of return negative for several years till the mid-1980s. During the 1980s, the volume of debt expanded considerably, particularly short-termdebt, due to automatic accommodation to Central government by the Central Bank (RBI),through the mechanism of ad hoc Treasury Bills. With a captive investor base [through StatutoryLiquidity Ratio (SLR) prescription, mostly] and interest below the market rate, secondary marketfor government bonds remained dormant. Artificial yields on government securities affected theyield structure of financial assets in the system, and led to higher lending rates. Driven by thesecompulsions, Reserve Bank’s monetary management was dominated by a regime of administeredinterest rates, and rising Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and SLR prescriptions. High CRR and SLRleft little room for monetary maneuvering. It is against this backdrop, and in the context of theoverall economic reforms, that development of the government securities markets was initiated,in the 1990s.Post-Reforms DevelopmentsThe development of government securities market reflects a transition from passive toactive debt management by the RBI. The reforms undertaken by the Reserve Bank since 1990scan be briefly viewed as a systematic exercise for the development of the debt market as well asintegration of the entire financial markets by making it deep, wide and transparent.The reforms aimed at increasing the operational autonomy of the RBI by measures, suchas, abolition of automatic monetization through ad-hoc Treasury Bills (in 1997) and itsreplacement by Ways and Means Advances facility, with limits, to meet temporary cash flowmismatches for the Central Government. The elimination of automatic monetisation wasconsidered critical in the stabilization policy.Secondly, government borrowing was made market based through the introduction ofauction system in primary issues.Thirdly, improvements in institutional infrastructure were sought to be achieved throughthe setting up of system of Primary Dealers.Fourthly, the breadth and depth of markets were sought to be improved by introduction ofa variety of new instruments viz., Zero Coupon Bonds, Capital Indexed Bonds, Floating RateBonds, Call and Put Option Bonds, etc.  However, plain vanilla bonds remain the mainstay.Fifthly, since April 1999, the Reserve Bank has been actively pursuing the consolidationof debt through reissuance/reopenings through price based auctions. This has greatly improvedthe market liquidity and helped the emergence of benchmark securities.                                                5Sixthly, trading and settlement systems have been improved through introduction of2Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) system and operationalisation of Negotiated Dealing System3(NDS) and Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) . Finally, a retail market in government securities is sought to be promoted through asystem of non-competitive bidding at primary auctions.Investor BaseTraditionally, the investor base for government securities in India has been banks,financial institutions, PFs, insurance and pension funds- commercial banks (at present 63.5 percent) and LIC (18.3 per cent) being the largest holders (Table 4). Most of the holdings of theseinvestors are in the nature of statutorily mandated investments. This category has been furtherdiversified by the entry of co-operative banks, regional rural banks, mutual funds and non-banking finance companies in recent periods. In addition, the entry of 100% Gilt Mutual Fundshas broadened the retail investor base. The thrust of policy initiatives in this direction is focusedon developing the retail segment of the market. Towards this end, several initiatives have beentaken.Table 4- Ownership Pattern of Government Securities – Major Investors (Per cent)1991 1995 2001 I.  Reserve Bank of India 20.29 2.04 7.72II.

The Scheme is open to any person including firms, companies,corporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity prescribed by RBI.                                                6The scheme provides for allocation of up to 5 per cent of the notified amount at the weightedaverage rate of accepted bids. Investors can bid, through banks or PDs, a minimum of Rs.10,000and maximum of Rs.10 million. To improve liquidity for retail investors in the secondarymarket, RBI has been encouraging banks/PDs to offer two-way prices to retail investors. A fewPDs have already introduced Schemes for retail marketing of Government securities using thenetwork of bank branches/Post offices. Another measure to promote retailing currently underconsideration is a Scheme for screen based order-driven trading on the stock exchanges.InstrumentsPrior to the 1990s, most of the government bond issuance was in the form of plainvanilla, fixed coupon securities. For a market to meet the diverse funding and hedging needs ofits participants, a wide array of instruments needs to be available. Through the 1990s, varioustypes of instruments have been introduced, like zero coupon bonds, capital indexed bonds,floating rate bonds and bonds with call and put option. But, plain vanilla bonds remain themainstay. The introduction of STRIPs is being envisaged. These instruments would serve theneed of asset-liability management of participants.Market IntermediariesThe system of Primary Dealers was introduced in 1996. The PDs underwrite as well asbid in auctions of primary issuances of government securities.  They are also expected to providetwo-way quotes in the secondary market, and thereby help develop the retail market. TheReserve Bank extends concessional finance to PDs. There are currently 18 PDs in operation. Ofthese, 9 are promoted by public sector banks and public financial institutions, 5 by foreign banksand 2 with the collaboration of foreign security houses and 2 by local non-banking financecompanies (NBFCs). RBI has prescribed guidelines to improve the risk management system ofPDs. The capital adequacy requirements of PDs take into account both credit risk and marketrisk. They are required to maintain a minimum capital of 15 per cent of aggregate risk weightedassets, including market risk capital (arrived at using the Value at Risk method). ALM disciplinehas been extended to PDs. Offsite surveillance of PDs is done on the basis of daily, monthly andquarterly returns. RBI is also vested with the responsibility of on-site inspection of primarydealers. A satellite dealer system was introduced in 1996 to act as a second tier to the PrimaryDealers in developing the market. The system, which was in operation for more than six years,was discontinued effective May 2002, as it did not yield the desired results.Measures to Deepen the Government Securities MarketsTo cater to the differing requirements of investors, Reserve Bank has been issuingGovernment securities of varying tenors ranging up to 30 years. For most part of the 1990s, thematurity of Central government issuance ranged up to 10 years. This has led to redemptionpressure and refinancing risk. This factor, as also the need to develop the yield curve for longertenors, has necessitated elongation of maturity of government bond issuance. Thus, the weightedaverage maturity of bonds issued during a year, which was around 5.5 years in 1996-97,increased to 14.3 years in 2001-02. As a debt manager, Reserve Bank has the obligation ofminimizing the cost of borrowing to the Government. Normally, with an upward sloping yieldcurve, longer the maturity of the security, higher is the cost; thus there is a trade-off betweentenor of borrowing and its cost.  However, the falling interest rate scenario in the last two years,has helped Reserve Bank to achieve the twin objectives of elongating the maturity profile of new7debt, and reducing the cost of borrowing at the same time. The average cost of issuance of datedsecurities issued during 2001-02 has come down substantially to 9.44 per cent from 10.95 percent in 2000-01 and 11.77 per cent in 1999-2000. The weighted average yield and weightedaverage maturity of the GOI dated securities issued during the current year so far works out to7.53 per cent and 13.3 years, respectively (Table 5).Table 5: Weighted Average Yield and Maturity for Market Loans of Government of India(per cent/years) Weighted Range of Weighted WeightedRange of YTMs at Primary Issues (%)Years Average Maturity of Average of Averageunder 5 5-10 years Yield (%) New Loans Maturity(yrs) Maturity ofyearsOver 10 outstandingYears stock1 2 3 4 5 6 7 81997-98 10.85-12.14 11.15-13.05 - 12.01 3-10 6.6 6.51998-99 11.40-11.68 11.10-12.25 12.25-12.60 11.86 2-20 7.7 6.31999-00 - 10.73-11.99 10.77-12.45 11.77 5-19 12.6 7.12000-01 9.47-10.95 9.88-11.69 10.47-11.70 10.95 2-20 10.6 7.52001-02 - 6.98-9.81 7.18-11.00 9.44 5-25 14.3 8.22002-03 6.65-8.14 6.84-8.62 7.53 7-30 13.7 8.6April-October 9,2002With a view to improving fungibility amongst the securities and facilitate consolidationof debt, a policy of passive consolidation through reissuance/ reopenings was started in 1999.The larger stock size of securities in question has greatly improved market liquidity, and helpedthe emergence of benchmark securities in the market. Active consolidation - by merging debts -has not been resorted to so far, in view of administrative costs and legal considerations. Theprocess of passive consolidation itself has helped in more or less containing the number of bondsto a level that was prevailing at the end of 1998-99. Of the 25 loans issued (excluding privateplacements) during 2001-02, 12 were new loans and the remaining were reissues of existingloans. This ability to 'reissue' or 'reopen' loans is limited by the maximum outstanding amountthat is perceived as 'manageable' from the viewpoint of redemption in the year of maturity.However, the drop in yields and resultant steep premia, in many cases, deters 'buy and hold'investors from subscribing to existing securities. As at the end of March 2002, there are 111Central Government securities with outstanding amount of Rs.5363 billion.  Of these, 23securities with minimum outstanding issues of Rs.100 billion or more account for 50 per cent ofthe total outstanding amount. The maturity profile of Government of India market loans ispresented in Table 6.Table 6: Maturity Profile of Market loans of Central Government(Percent to total amount outstanding/ raised) Amount Outstanding At end- Raised During the YearMarchYear Under 5 5-10 Over 10 Under 5 5-10 Years Over 10Years Years Years Years Years81996-97 45 29 26 50 50 -1997-98 41 41 18 18 82 01998-99 41 42 16 18 68 141999-00 37 39 24 - 35 652000-01 27 47 26 6 41 532001-02 31 36 33 2 24 74An additional source of demand for government securities has evolved with theintroduction of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), fully collateralised against governmentsecurities. Repo and Reverse Repo operations between RBI and banks under LAF, havedeveloped into the primary mechanism of managing short-term liquidity in the system (Repo for1 day and 14 days, reverse repo for 1 day). The system is also used for maintaining orderlyconditions in money market.In respect of T-Bills, a pre-announced issuance calendar for auctions is being providedsince 1998-99.  Further, in an effort to provide further transparency and stability in theGovernment securities market as well as to enable institutional and retail investors to plan theirinvestments in a better manner, Reserve Bank has started the practice of announcing a half-yearly calendars for issuance of Government of India dated securities in the current fiscal year2002-03.Developments in Market InfrastructureSecurities Settlement System: Settlement of government securities and funds is being done on agross trade-by-trade Delivery vs. Payments (DvP) basis in the books of Reserve Bank, since1995. A Special Funds Facility from Reserve Bank for securities settlement has also been inoperation since October 2000 for breaking gridlock situations arising in the course of DvPsettlement.With the introduction of Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) in February 2002,which acts as clearing house and a central counterparty, the problem of gridlock of settlementshas been reduced. To enable Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL) account holders toavail of the benefits of dematerialised holding through their bankers, detailed guidelines havebeen issued to ensure that entities providing custodial services for their constituents employappropriate accounting practices and safekeeping procedures.Negotiated Dealing System : A Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) (Phase I) has beenoperationalised effective from February 15, 2002.  In Phase I, the NDS provides on lineelectronic bidding facility in primary auctions, daily LAF auctions, screen based electronicdealing and reporting of transactions in money market instruments, facilitates secondary markettransactions in Government securities and dissemination of information on trades with minimaltime lag.  In addition, the NDS enables “paperless” settlement of transactions in governmentsecurities with electronic connectivity to CCIL and the DvP settlement system at the Public DebtOffice through electronic SGL transfer form.9Clearing Corporation of India Limited : The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL)commenced its operations in clearing and settlement of transactions in Government securities(including repos) with effect from February 15, 2002.  Acting as a central counterparty throughnovation, the CCIL provides guaranteed settlement and has in place risk management systems tolimit settlement risk and operates a settlement guarantee fund backed by lines of credit fromcommercial banks. All repo transactions have to be necessarily put through the CCIL, while alloutright transactions up to Rs.200 million have to be settled through CCIL ( Transactionsinvolving larger amounts are settled directly in RBI).Transparency and Data DisseminationTo enable both institutional and retail investors to plan their investments better and alsoto providing further transparency and stability in the Government securities market, an indicativecalendar for issuance of dated securities has been introduced in 2002. To improve theinformation flow to the market Reserve Bank announces auction results on the day of auctionitself and all transactions settled through SGL accounts are released on the same day by way ofpress releases/on RBI website. Statistical information relating to both primary and secondarymarket for Government securities is disseminated at regular interval to ensure transparency ofdebt management operations as well as of secondary market activity. This is done through eitherpress releases or Bank’s publications viz., (e.g., RBI monthly Bulletin, Weekly StatisticalSupplement, Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, Report on Currency and Finance andAnnual Report).The Reserve Bank is the initial signatory of Special Data Dissemination Standards ofIMF and places substantial information and statistics on its website. The data on tradesnegotiated/reported on NDS will also be available shortly on RBI’s website.Corporate Bond MarketsThe Reserve Bank’s role in the development of corporate bond markets is indirect and isgoverned by its interest in monetary policy transmission and in the stability and efficiency of thefinancial sector as a whole. Besides, banks, whose financial health is the responsibility of thecentral bank, have a large exposure to the corporate bond market with more than 80 per cent ofsuch investments being in privately placed corporate securities. Activity in the secondary marketis thus rather thin.  As the non-transparent practices in this market is a matter of concern,Reserve Bank issued guidelines in June 2001 specifying the due diligence to be undertaken,disclosures to be obtained and credit appraisal to be made by investing banks. Subsequently aWorking Group set up by RBI (February 2002) went into the detailed disclosure norms and datacollection measures on private placements.  Currently, RBI and SEBI are working together todevise a regulating mechanism for the issuers of private placements which will address issues ofquality, transparency, end-use of funds and listing of such bonds.There is no comprehensive database source for outstanding stock of corporate debtissuance in India. An analysis of the flow data (issuances) in recent period indicates dominanceof private placement (Table 7).Table 7: Growth of Indian Corporate Debt Market - Issuances10(Rs. billion)Year Total Corporate Private Public IssuesDebt Placement658 613 451999-00(93.2) (6.8)711 678 332000-01(95.4) (4.6)710 649 612001-02(91.4) (8.6)Figures in brackets indicate percentage share to Total.The trends in the issuance pattern of privately placed debt during the last three years is presentedin Table 8, which reveals the following trend-i) The share of the private sector in total private placement market has been growing vis-à-vis the public sector.ii) The share of financial entities, both public and private has come down partly because ofthe limit imposed on raising of Tier 2 capital by banks.iii) Of late, there appears to be an increase in private placements by the private non-financial sector.Table 8: Composition of the Private Placement Market(Per cent to total)Private Placement 2001-02 2000-01 1999-20001.

Total (1+2)100 100 100A very large proportion of the debt being issued of late is being rated. In the year 2000-01, 80% of the debt (in volume terms) was rated, while the proportion of rated debt rose to 91%during 2001-02 (April-September). From the rating distribution, it emerges that more than half ofthe total issuance (52 to 53%) in this period is rated AAA, while another 15% is having a ratingof AA+ in 2001-02 as against 2% in 2000-01, a pointer perhaps that a growing number ofinvestors are beginning to factor the rating rationale as a key input into their investmentdecisions. Currently, about 75 per cent of privately placed corporate issuance is AA rated orbetter.11Until 1992, interest rate on corporate bond issuances was regulated and was uniformacross credit categories. In the initial years, corporate bonds were issued with "sweeteners" in theform of debt-equity convertibility clause, or equity warrants. Most corporate bonds were plaincoupon paying bonds, though a few variations in the form of zero coupon securities, deepdiscount bonds and secured promissory notes were issued. After the deregulation of interest rateson corporate bonds in 1992, a variety of instruments in the corporate bond markets have beenintroduced, including bond strips, floating rate instruments with floors and caps. In recent years,there has been an increase in issuance of corporate bonds with embedded put and call option.Other aspects for development of corporate bond markets which are under considerationare- availability of information and transparency of the market, increased securitization andincreased dematerialisation in corporate bonds and consideration of Repo for corporate bondsInstitutional IssuesRole of Self-Regulatory OrganisationsIn the context of Indian debt market, self-regulatory bodies like the Fixed Income MoneyMarket and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) and the Primary Dealers Association ofIndia (PDAI) have been encouraged in the recent past, as part of reform process to give animpetus to the development of the bond and money markets in India. These bodies have servedas crucial layers between the regulator and market and have contributed to developing newbenchmarks and products besides providing training and development support to participants.They have formulated guidelines for dispute resolution mechanisms and are also involved in theprocess of developing standard practices and codes of conduct.  Both PDAI and FIMMDA arerepresented in the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of the Reserve Bank of India meant fordeliberating and advising RBI, on issues pertaining to Government Securities and MoneyMarkets. TAC is constituted by Reserve Bank and includes, apart from RBI officials, importantmarket participants, academicians and policy makers.  FIMMDA is involved in the task ofvaluation of all Central Government Securities. The daily FIMMDA yield curve of CentralGovernment bonds is fast emerging as an accepted benchmark to price securities. In addition tothis, FIMMDA has also been contributing to developing guidelines for documentation of repo,securitised debt and several other debt market instruments.Banks and Bond MarketsIn India, the banking system which incidentally has been dominated by the public sector,played a pioneering role in initiating growth of mutual funds, merchant banking and otherfinancial services.  Structurally, banks have been permitted to operate through subsidiaries asasset management companies, PDs, merchant banks and mutual funds.  The DevelopmentFinancial Institutions also played a role but they dominated in promoting credit rating agencies,sponsoring national stock exchanges, depositories, etc.  In regard to Government Securitiessegment of the market, which accounts for about 75 per cent of the stock, about 60 per cent ofthe stock is held by the banking system.  As regards the corporate debt segment, both privateplacement and public issue, over half of the issuance is by banks and financial institutions.Role of Credit Rating Agencies12+In India, there are four Credit Rating Agencies ( CRAs) and each of them hascollaboration with internationally renowned CRAs to supplement the local knowledge and skills.The RBI prescribes a number of regulatory uses of ratings.  Of those related to the money anddebt markets, a corporate must get an issue of Commercial Paper rated and may issue such papersubject to a minimum rating.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which is theregulator of CRAs has stipulated that ratings are compulsory on all public issues of debentureswith maturity exceeding 18 months.  Pension funds can only invest in debt securities that havehigh ratings, as per the stipulations of Government.Tax Regime and Debt MarketsThe removal of tax deduction at source (TDS) on Government Securities resulted inending the practice of voucher trading in the Government Securities market and thus removingpricing distortions in the market.  The amendments to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 haveexempted debt instruments dealt in demat form from the applicability of stamp duty(Government Securities as such are exempted from the stamp duty).  This encouraged dematholding/transactions in debt instruments, as also trading in debt instruments.The recent amendments to Section 47 of the IT Act, facilitating securities lending andborrowing operations will ensure safe and smooth settlement through the recently establishedCCIL.The recent notification issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Government ofIndia in bringing about rationalisation in the tax treatment for the deep discount bonds (wheremarked-to-market gains are to be reckoned for tax purpose), apart from removing the distortionswill keep the market in readiness for the development of STRIPS in Government Securities andfacilitate a zero coupon yield curve.For the financial system as a whole, the Expert Committee to Review the System of4Administered Interest Rates (2002) and other related Committees have made certainrecommendations on the tax regime, which if implemented would remove some distortions andensure a level playing field among participants and instruments in the financial markets.  Thesemeasures coupled with the decision to align the administered interest rates with market rates ofinterest should pave the way for significant improvement in the environment for debt markets.Road Ahead for Indian Debt MarketsDebt management in India has clearly come a long way from a passive system to amarket driven exercise with developed institutions, instruments and markets.In terms of international benchmarks, India ranks on par with some of the developedcountries in areas like institutional framework, risk management set-up, market development,clearing and settlement procedures and transparency in debt management operations                                                13The artificially administered interest rate system of government securities market hastransformed into a market determined one, and an inactive thin secondary market has grown intoan actively traded and reasonably liquid market.Settlement systems have already developed significantly. RBI is also working towardsthe development of a system for Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), which is expected to beoperational in about a years' time.Some of the major issues relating to Government debt need to be highlighted:Firstly, separation of Government debt management from RBI has been, in principle,considered desirable. However, this would be dependent on the fulfilment of three pre-conditions, viz., development of financial markets, reasonable control over fiscal deficit andnecessary legislative changes. The feasibility and further steps for separation of government debtmanagement from Reserve Bank is proposed to be taken up once Fiscal Responsibility Bill(which is pending before Parliament) is enacted.Secondly, measures to widen the base of the repo market including extending it to CSGLaccount holders, introduction of longer term repo, rollover of repos, taxation and standardisedaccounting are the major areas to be focussed in the near future.Thirdly, the feasibility of a "When Issued" market for Government securities, whichwould help efficient price discovery in the primary auctions, is being examined.Fourthly, operational modalities are being finalised for the introduction of STRIPS.Fifthly, order driven screen based anonymous trading in government securities on thestock exchanges is under consideration.Sixthly, dematerialised holding of all bonds, corporate as well as government bonds, issought to be achieved.Finally, the implementation of the next phase of the PDO-NDS project involvingintegration with security settlement system and primary markets operations, automation andinter-connectivity of PDOs, electronic maintenance of record of ownership, etc. is under way.* Paper presented in the JSEPA Workshop on the Development of Bond Markets in Asia at Singapore held onOctober 17-18, 2002.* Exchange Rate at present is Rs. 48.33=1 US $# Market capitalization at NSE, Mumbai.
