Some random issues    2 FMIs and Financial Stability- Some concepts  3 Financial Market Infrastructure   Multilateral system among participating institutions,  including the operator of the system, used for the purposes  of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities,  derivatives, or other financial transactions.    - Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure    Five Categories of FMIs:        Payment Systems  Central Securities Depository    Central  Counterparties Securities Settlement System    Trade Repository      4 Financial Stability    There is no universally accepted definition of financial stability. Definitions by    various experts abound but most definitions are not amenable to quantification.    Financial system functioning without disruption and return to steady state after          periods of volatility/vulnerability without significant impairment to longer term       prospects, is generally considered an indicator of stability.      Volatilities within an acceptable/tolerable    range can represent a state of financial    stability.     Financial Stability Dimensions  ? Markets, institutions, infrastructure  ? The macro economy  ? The global economy     Factors Affecting Financial Stability  ? Vulnerabilities in the real economy  ? Global imbalances and rapid capital flows  ? Complex financial products and rapid technological  development  ? Asset price bubbles  ? Shadow banking system  ? Contagion  ? Interconnected markets  ? Too big to fail counterparties    Well.. Virtually anything. Anywhere!!!   How FMIs help in Financial Stability  ? Build market confidence  ? CCPs shifts counterparty risks onto themselves and provide trust to  continue transacting   ? Ensure settlement when transactions are due for settlement on  account of their risk management practices and helps in retaining  the sanity in the market.    ? Minimise credit and market risk  ? Novation by CCPs  ? Complex bilateral networks collapse into simple hub and spoke    ? Risk distribution  ? Achieves high netting efficiency- reduction of exposure  ? Margins and Collaterals- reduce default risks  ? Risk mututalisation- Default funds and loss allocation  7           How FMIs help in Financial Stability (2)  ? Application of Risk management framework  ? Equitable, transparent with system wide impact  ? Risk and benefit of participation transparent to participants  ? Action to unfavourable market developments fairly known  ? Address information opaqueness  ? FMIs have at any given time information on positions of market  participants  ? Trade repositories help in recording and collating trade positions  across members and across markets  ? Economic efficiency   ? Netting benefits   ? Process automation  ? New products and service offerings   8           Role of FMIs during crisis  The crisis would have been much more severe had central banks  not taken efforts to introduce robust payment and settlement  systems, including for foreign exchange, over the two decades  ahead of the crisis. The systemic impact of failure of a financial  institution depends critically on the robustness of the  infrastructure underpinning those markets in which it is active.    - 'Central Banking Lessons from the Crisis' (May 27, 2010)    ? No materialisation of systemic risk vis--vis potential of risk  spreading across jurisdictions and markets on account of inter- linkages  ? Effective management of defaults in a non-disruptive manner   ? Continued functioning of FX markets, money market  ? Continued functioning of RTGS systems, CLS and CCPs    9       Why FMIs failures impact Financial Stability  10 Criticality of FMIs growing  ? Volume and value of financial transactions handled by FMIs are  enormous              Source: OTC Derivative survey, FSB, BIS  11 Criticality of FMIs growing (2)  ? Infrastructures do not work at national level anymore  ? Expanded foot prints  ? Competition and cost effectiveness  ? Regulatory initiatives promoting growth of market infrastructure  ? EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive  (known as  "MiFID") in European Economic Area    ? Interdependencies among FMIs  ? Multiple markets, Domestic, cross-border     ? Links and interoperability  ? Multiple types of links  ? Within same categories of FMIs or among different categories    12     FMIs- do they concentrate risk?   ...it is an understatement that it would be a disaster if a  clearing house failed.  Commentators have, indeed, been  emphasising that CCPs are becoming systemic. To my own way  of thinking, they have already been systemic for the markets  they clear for a very long time.   - Paul Tucker, Bank of England    A CCP can be thought of as the financial analogue of a dam,  prevent rising water upstream from causing flooding  downstream. One problem with dams is that if they fail, those  they are meant to protect can suffer significant distress.  Similarly CCPs can be both mitigate systemic risk and  if they  become stressed  spread it   - David Murphy    13 Can the FMI fail?  Clearing houses have nearly failed or failed in the past  ? Caisse de liquidation (Paris) in 1974  ? Kuala Lumpur Commodity Clearing House in 1983  ? US Equity Clearing House in 1987  ? Hong Kong Futures Guarantee Corporation in 1987  ? BM&F in 1999    14 How FMI failure impact financial stability?  ? Potential for triggering systemic risk  ? FMIs are critical nodes in networks   ? Impact would be sever than participant failures  ? Contagion effect due to inter-connectedness and links  ? Credit losses  ? Liquidity and collateral dislocation and scarcity  ? FMI failure can result in further call for capital/financial resources  from from members and aggravating members positions  ? Market failures on account of lack of substitutability   15   Moot point is  CCPs also concentrate risk. If not properly managed, [CCPs] can  be sources of financial shocks, such as liquidity dislocations and  credit losses, or a major channel through which these shocks are  transmitted across domestic and international financial  markets.- Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure  FMIs are much more complex  The consequences of a failure by a CCP could be even more  severe than the failure of a large participants    16 Lessons from crisis for Regulators  17 Lessons for regulators from financial crisis    FMIs generally proved resilient to the crisis  due to the efforts taken by the regulators  18 However..  ? There is a need for further reforms  ? Past crisis is an indicator but future may be more severe  ? FMIs should be capable of withstanding multiple failures  ? Secured lines of liquidity are not so secured during crisis  ? Infrastructure does not work at national level and hence  need greater co-operation among authorities  ? OTC derivative markets pose inherent risks in terms of  counterparty credit risk and lack of transparency  19 OTC derivatives and crisis  ? The notional amount outstanding in OTC derivatives  stood at US$650 trillion- more than ten times annual  global GDP (BIS, December 2011).   ? Lack of transparency  ? Under collateralisation  ? Market infrastructure inadequate to sustain the volume     20  Regulatory response to financial crisis  21 G-20 Agenda  G20 recommendations - Pittsburgh communiqu of September 2009     Trading and Clearing: All standardised OTC derivative contracts  should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where  appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) by end  2012 at the latest     Reporting: OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade  repositories (TRs)     Non-centrally cleared contracts should be subject to higher capital  requirements     The FSB and its relevant members should assess regularly progress  and whether it is sufficient to improve transparency in the derivatives  markets, mitigate systemic risk, and protect against market abuse     22 FSB safeguards for CCPs- move to centralised clearing  ? Fair and open access  ? Oversight and regulation  ? Recovery and resolution  ? Access to emergency liquidity    23 Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures  ? Unify and harmonize the three existing sets of standards  ? Strengthen existing standards  ? Inclusion of new standards  ? Strengthen the responsibilities of authorities  ? Treat the principles as requirements, not  recommendations  ? Standard disclosure framework and assessment  methodology      24 Recovery and resolution of FMIs  ? CPSS-IOSCO consultative report published in July 2012  ? Effective recovery and resolution framework for different  categories of FMIs  ? Aligned with FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution  Regimes for Financial Institutions  ? Further work on FMI recovery planning on-going    25 Other reforms impacting FMIs  Capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties   Interim framework for determining capital requirements for bank  exposures to CCPs as additions and amendments to Basel II  guidelines   Qualified CCPs are those compliant with PFMIs and exposures to  such CCPs would receive preferential capital treatment in terms of  risk weights   Further clarifications provided in the FAQ on Basel III Counterparty  credit risk and exposure to Central Counterparties published by BIS  in December 2012  Margining requirements for non-centrally-cleared derivatives   Laying out a set of high-level principles on margining practices and  treatment of collateral, and proposing margin requirements for non- centrally-cleared derivatives with the objectives of reducing systemic  risk and promoting central clearing    BCBS-IOSCO consultative paper published in June 2012   Second consultative document released in February 2013  26 Other reforms impacting FMIs  Data reporting and aggregation requirements     Laying out minimum data reporting requirements and  standardised formats, and  the methodology and mechanism for  data aggregation on a global basis    Access by authorities to trade repository data   Guidance on the level of access by authorities to data kept in the  TRs   CPSS-IOSCO task force preparing further guidance     Legal Entity Identifier     Establishing a scheme for the issuance of unique legal entity  identifiers    27 Challenges in implementing the reform initiatives  28 Implementation challenges   ? FMIs and banks are different and have diverse risk profiles  ? New standards are much more complex and hence implementation  would be challenging  ? Changes in the legal and regulatory framework  ? Set out responsibilities and objectives  ? Translating the PFMIs into oversight standards  ? Identifying the entities whom would be subjected to PFMIs  ? Building skill sets for implementation, assessment and validation   ? Developing enforcement tools  ? Developing co-operative oversight   29 Some random issues  30 Addressing liquidity risk requirements    ? Liquidity could be a challenge in skewed markets dominated by a  few large players  ? Maintaining secured lines of liquidity support from private sector may  not only be difficult but may be expensive  ? Alternate arrangements such as repo and financing by non- defaulting members may serve but may not be adequate  ? Central bank liquidity support has moral hazard issues; could be  resorted to as an emergency measure. Is it the most optimal structure?   ? Could focus on participant liquidity rather than FMI liquidity be an  alternative?  ? Liquidity requirement in DNS system- whether transaction limits and  exposure limits would help?    31 Increased collateralisation  ? PFMIs stress on high quality collaterals with low market and low  liquidity risk  ? Stringent collateralisation requirements are a key element of over- the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets reform.  ? ISDA  estimates that an additional US$1 trillion in initial and variation  margin will have to be posted in the interest rate swaps (IRS) market  alone  ? In many jurisdictions collaterals with low credit, liquidity, and market  risks may only be limited to government securities.  ? Many jurisdictions may not have depth and width in G-Sec markets,  corporate bonds and other high quality collaterals  ? Further issues relating to concentration, reuse and liquidation of  collaterals need to be addressed.    32       Applicability of PFMIs to central bank   operated FMIs  ? Objective should be to apply PFMIs to central banks FMIs for  ensuring level playing field  ? However, there could be challenges in applying  some of the  principles in toto such as governance, credit risk, general business risk  etc  ? Other modes/ methods for applying PFMIs should be attempted         33   Thank you  34 References   OTC derivatives reform and collateral demand impact- by Che Sidanius and Filip  Zikes, Financial Stability Paper No. 18- October 2012, Bank of England   The Systemic Risks of OTC Derivatives Central Clearing- by David Murphy, Rivast  consulting, January 5, 2012   Collateral requirements for mandatory central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives-  by Daniel Heller and Nicholas Vause, BIS Working Paper No 373, March 2012   Report on the lessons learned from the financial crisis with regard to the functioning of  European Financial Market Infrastructure, European Central Bank, April 2010    OTC Derivatives Market Reforms, Fourth Progress Report on Implementation,  Financial Stability Board, October 2012   The Bank of England?s Approach to the supervision of financial market infrastructure,  Bank of England, December 2012   The Economics of Central Clearing Theory and Practice- by Craig Pirrong, ISDA  Discussion Papers Series, May 2011   The Bank of Canada?s Approach to Adopting the Principles for Financial Market  Infrastructures, Bank of Canada, Financial System Review, December 2012      35   References     Clearing Houses as System Risk Managers?, Speech by Paul Tucker, at the DTCC-CSFI  Post Trade Fellowship Launch, London, 1 June, 2011   Ensuring the smooth functioning of money market, Speech by Benot Cur, Member of  the Executive Board of the ECB, 17th Global Securities Financing Summit, Luxembourg, 16  January 2013   Recovery and resolution of financial market infrastructures, CPSS, BIS, July 2012   Margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives- Second Consultative document,  Basel Committee, BIS, February 2013   Report on OTC derivatives data reporting and aggregation requirements , CPSS-IOSCO,  BIS, January 2012   Discussions at the recent RBI seminar on Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures  and Innovations in Retail Payment Systems, New Delhi, February 14-15, 2013    R ole of Financial Market Infrastructure in Financial System Stability &  Implications for Central Bank : Presentation by Shri G.
