1MONETARY CO-OPERATION IN ASIAMr. Chairman and distinguished participants,It is a privilege to be associated with the deliberations on Asian Integration.Singapore very vividly signifies both the diversity and potential for prosperity of theAsian region.  We deeply appreciate the hospitality and excellent arrangements madeby the IMF and MAS for this High Level Seminar. The discussion paper circulated bythe MAS is of high quality and is a very useful document. This session is devoted tosubjects of special interest to Central Banks, namely “Enhancing RegionalSurveillance and Monetary Co-operation in Asia”.  I intend focusing on one of thetopics flagged for discussion in this session by the organizers, namely “Is there scopefor co-operation or co-ordination on exchange rate policies over the long term?”2. In this brief presentation, I propose to explore the following areas : First,changing dynamics of exchange rate regimes in Asia; second, importance of theAsian economies for global prosperity and stability; third, the Asian dynamics offinancial integration, fourth, the scope for co-operation or co-ordination on exchangerate policies; and finally, some thoughts specific to the Indian situation.Changing dynamics of exchange rate regimes in Asia3. In the period prior to the 1997 crisis, many of the Asian economies followed anexchange rate regime of fixed but adjustable pegs. During the East Asian crisis, it wasrealized that such pegs were quite vulnerable to speculative attacks. Several EastAsian economies have adopted different types of exchange rate regimes in the post-crisis period. While some countries continued with pegged regimes, others movedover to some kind of managed floats.4. Thus, it appears that in most economies of Asia, the weight of experienceseems to be tilted in favour of intermediate regimes, and post-crisis, the choice of theexchange rate regimes generally reveals a growing preference for relatively moreflexible exchange rates than before. In this regard, given the current state of relativelybenign international financial market conditions, it is possible to speculate that as thecomfort level of forex reserves as self insurance is reached, and institutions and                                                1 Speech by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the IMF-MAS High-Level Seminar onAsian Integration held on September 3, 2005 at Singapore.financial markets in Asian economies acquire further resilience, this shift in preferencemight grow stronger and wider. The recent moves by the Chinese and the Malaysianauthorities would only substantiate such a notion.5. An intermediate managed floating regime may not sound technically a perfectsystem but, prima facie, it has proven to be the most pragmatic which explains itspopularity.  The built-in flexibility allows the domestic currency to be responsive tomarket forces, while it meets the concern of the authorities for ‘basic stability’ andorderly movement in forex markets. In contrast to a pure float, this mechanism canprevent excessive exchange rate volatility that can have adverse impacts on externaltrade and investment.  In other words, rather than being distracted by a quest for the‘perfect system’, perhaps it is wise to focus on improving the working of any given floatregime.  The real issue in this regard relates to how much of a float is envisaged andthe nature, magnitudes as well as instruments of its management.  These woulddepend on several factors, especially the changing contours between flexibility andvolatility in each economy.6. The recent record of very impressive growth in Asia has been driven by tradeand cross-border investment flows.  The rapid strides achieved by China haveprovided a powerful stimulus for regional expansion.  But it is the nature of trade flowsas much as their impressive scale that is shaping economic relationships andprospects. While much of this trade involves production of goods, still ultimatelydestined for the North American and European markets, it also reflects an increaseddivision of labour, product specialization and integration within the region.  Togetherwith this, fundamental shifts in economic relations are also taking place.7. Many of the intra-Asia trade flows, which correspond to the internationaldivision of labour between Asian countries, are flows of exports of components andspares but not of finished goods for their end consumers.  A crucial question for somecountries in the region is the level of income that would enable domestic demand tobecome the main driving force of growth.  As domestic demand, notably householdsector demand, becomes the driver of growth, movement to a more flexible exchangerate policy would be feasible.8. Similarly, as the corporates as well as financial intermediaries, especially banksequip themselves to manage movements in exchange rate, greater flexibility would befeasible, as forex markets also would tend to become less volatile. It is also necessaryin this regard to recognize the ‘insurance’ in the form of foreign exchange reservesneeded against potentially volatile capital flows which should be sufficient to take careof fluctuations in capital flows and ‘liquidity at risk’. It is generally felt that reserveswould act as a circuit breaker for situations when unidirectional expectations becomeself-fulfilling. The swap arrangements among the Central Banks such as the oneunder Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) add to the level of ‘insurance’ and hence to thecomfort factor to the Central Banks in dealing with excess volatility in capital flows.9. Recently there has been considerable expansion in global liquidity but thisshould not dilute the vigil of policy makers in regard to volatility in capital flows.  Veryoften, it is difficult to assess, ex ante, whether capital flows are temporary orpermanent.  It is prudent for policy makers to assume that they are reversible till theyare proven to be enduring. Impact on real economy of significant reverse movementsover a relatively short period could be destabilizing with attendant serious welfareimplications.  We in Asia are acutely aware of these aspects.  Recent sharp upwardmovements in oil prices in an era of heightened uncertainties is yet another reason forpolicy makers in Asia to be vigilant.  The hikes in oil prices tend to have adverseconsequences for growth and prices in several of our economies but they also havesignificant impact on external sector, encompassing both current and capital accounts.On current account, the trade deficit will tend to widen.  On capital account, surplusesgenerated in oil exporting countries may add to global liquidity and lead to largecapital inflows to emerging markets that are net importers of oil. Hence, a carefulassessment of the medium term sustainability would be imperative.10. Over the medium to longer term, the exchange rate regimes and relatedpolicies are likely to be influenced by (a) the confidence in the strength of Asianeconomies; (b) perceived resilience of their economic as well as financial systems; (c)growing economic and financial integration amongst Asian economies; (d) emergingsignificance of Asian economies in the global economy; (e) the state of internationalfinancial architecture and market conditions and (f) policy-induced measures for co-operation and co-ordination amongst Asian economies.Importance of Asian economies and policies11. The fact that the Asian economies have recovered swiftly after the crises of1997 is an important consideration in viewing the future external developments.  Thegrowth rate of developing Asia, which had plummeted to 4.2 per cent in 1998,recovered quickly to 6.2 per cent in 1999, rising further to 6.6 per cent in the year2000. In the more recent period, the recovery in the output of the Asian economieshas been robust with developing Asia growing by nearly 8 per cent in 2003 and 2004.It is widely recognized that the contribution of Asia to global growth has generallybeen very impressive in recent years, and may continue to be so, for several years infuture.  The current account on the balance of payments has been in surplus for manyif not all Asian economies. The private capital flows to the emerging Asia haverecovered from an outflow of US $ 52 billion in 1998 to an inflow of US $ 151 billion in2004.  At the same time, the reserve build up in the region has been significant.12. In the backdrop of the resilience of the Asian economies and their ability tobounce back after a deep financial crisis, there is resurgence of confidence in theirfuture. Strategies in the form of having mutual swap agreements under the ChiangMai initiative, to guard against speculative attacks, could now be enlarged, and couldalso be supplemented by greater co-operation and co-ordination in the exchange rateregimes and policies.13. Indeed, from a longer-term perspective, we must note that Asia is appropriatelypoised in terms of abundance in factors of production – labour and capital –particularly labour, as the demography is clearly in favour of Asia to sustain a long-term growth. The emergence of surplus factors of production in Asia combined withfinancial strength would impact prices, wages and exchange rates.  Asian economiescould explore strategies to evolve a system whereby they could not only prevent and,if necessary, manage financial crises on their own to the extent possible, but also playa more active role in co-ordinating policies with other major developed economies.These arrangements could be consistent with continued and an active role of IMF ininternational monetary cooperation.14. It is useful to recall that the acute sense of interdependence aroused by thefinancial “contagion” in 1997 convinced the Asian economies of the importance ofeconomic cooperation, one that reflected their common interests and priorities as wellas strengthened their voice in the global arena. Among others, this led to two parallelmovements – one in South Asia in the form of the SAARC Initiative and the other inEast Asia reflecting the ASEAN+3 Initiative.15. The idea of having an integrated financial system so as to provide viable ‘safety2net’ in times of crisis germinated. As a result, the idea of “ASEAN + 3” Initiativegained prominence. This, in turn, was reflected in two correlated developments. First,in 2000, ASEAN+3 countries mutually agreed to form a network of bilateral swapagreements to provide mutual protection from financial emergencies, popularly knownas the Chiang Mai Initiative. More recently, there has been a resurgence in the debateon the formation of an Asian Monetary Fund and the adoption of an Asian CurrencyUnit. Concomitantly, reflecting the parallel developments under the ASEAN+3Initiative, there has been wider discussion and debate on the formation of a South3Asian Economic Union and a South Asian Development Bank . Second, the Asian4Bond Fund  Initiative was launched in 2003 reflecting the effort to develop a regionalbond market for catering to the medium and long term financing needs of the Asianeconomies.Asian dynamics of financial integration16. It is useful to recognize that, there are several important factors that arerelevant for considering greater financial integration in Asia.  First, the wide diversity inthe level of economic development across the region. Second, the divergent level offinancial sector development across the region. Third, the limited scope of the existingintra-region resource-pooling mechanism and the lack of institutional frameworks.Fourth, the presence of asynchronous business cycles amongst the countries in theregion. Such divergences are aptly reflected in the asymmetric transmission ofdemand and monetary shocks in the region.17. There are significant developments that point to emergence of enabling factorsfor strengthening of economic integration in Asia.  First, emerging Asia fares quite wellin terms of factor mobility and wage and price flexibility. Second, the trade intensityratios in emerging Asia, particularly the ASEAN region, are quite high and are likely toaccelerate. Further, Foreign Direct Investment flows within the region are significant.Third, tariffs are being brought down rapidly.  Fourth, the free trade agreements are                                                2 The ASEAN + 3 was formed as a gathering of the governments of ASEAN members, China, Koreaand Japan that were Asian members of ASEM, had its first leaders’ meeting in December 1997.3 The SAARC Council of Ministers meeting held in Islamabad during January 2-3, 2004, desired thatthe SAARCFINANCE should prepare a concept paper on the proposed South Asian Economic Unionand a South Asian Development Bank.4 The Asian Bond Fund is basically an arrangement for pooling of a portion of foreign exchangereserves of few East Asia and Pacific countries and the Fund portfolio is invested in the liquid US dollardenominated bonds of major Asian economies.expanding and deepening making the prospects of tariff-free and virtual tradeintegration in Asia sooner than later.  Fifth, there is a strong commitment of politicalleadership in Asia to focus on economic issues. There are regular and frequent closeinteractions among Central Bank Governors in Asia which should strengthen theprocess of cooperation.Scope for co-operation and co-ordination18. The Chiang Mai Initiative is a good starting point to build on the various existinginitiatives. Although under the present dispensation the CMI is complementary tosimilar IMF initiatives, it has an important symbolic value in as much as it can signalthe markets a regional commitment to supporting any member country’s currency thatis under speculative pressures. It also recognizes that establishing swaparrangements does not obviate the need to address structural and financial sectorweaknesses.  It may also be added that while CMI might have contributed to theexchange rate stability in the region, it has also contributed to closer regionaleconomic and financial integration and co-operation.  It is useful to discuss ways ofcarrying this process forward.19. There are several fora already established for regional monetary cooperation.The Asian Clearing Union (ACU), which was established in 1974 at the initiative of theEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) has eight membercentral banks.  The main objective of the ACU is to provide a facility to settle currentinternational transactions among members on multilateral net settlement basis.  TheACU mechanism also provides for a currency swap type mechanism amongstmembers for trade transactions. ACU aims to promote monetary co-operationamongst the members and has also resulted in closer relations across the bankingsystems of the member countries. During the last few years trade settled through ACUmechanism has grown at a rate higher than that of total international trade of themember countries.20. Yet another forum for exchange of views and experiences, including throughvisits and training programmes, is SAARCFINANCE.  Areas  covered in recentmonths include communication policies and practices of Central Banks and Real TimeGross Settlement systems.21. The recent policy shift in China from a pegged to a flexible exchange rateregime is a significant development in international finance. This step is a watershedin the financial sector reform process now underway in China.  Going by the availableindications, China has long-term plans for development of deep and liquid markets infinancial assets, which would encompass foreign exchange, bonds, and equities, asalso commodities.Some thoughts on India’s approach22. It may be useful to recall our experience with exchange rate management inIndia. In September 1975, the Government of India proposed a system of determiningthe exchange rate based on a basket of five currencies, with weighting, basedessentially though not entirely, on trade weights. The permissible range for theexchange rate was 2.25 per cent on either side.  The currencies chosen were USDollar, Pound Sterling, Deutsche Mark, Japanese Yen and SDR.  The weights wererevised in 1979, 1983 and 1984, though the currency composition broadly remainedthe same with only one change in 1984 when French Franc replaced SDR. The band,however, was extended from 2.25 to 5.0 per cent in 1979 and from 5 to 10 per cent in1986.  Soon after the devaluation of the rupee in July 1991, there was a move inMarch 1992 to a regime of partial convertibility (essentially a dual exchange rate). InMarch 1993 the regime changed to a uniform exchange rate of the rupee which wasmarket-determined – a system which remains in place to date. In August 1994, Indiamoved over to current account convertibility. From the latter part of 1997, India movedto a cautious and well calibrated move towards capital account convertibility. Thesedevelopments tested the exchange rate regime which proved conducive to growthwhile maintaining stability.23. India has been actively participating in the various initiatives inSAARCFINANCE and ACU arrangements.  Exchange of views and co-ordination inpolicies through both formal and informal mechanisms have been the maincharacteristics of co-operation. India’s trade links with Asia are growing at anunprecedented scale.  The stated policy in regard to tariffs is to bring them on par withthose of East Asia as soon as feasible.  Policy on Free Trade Agreements withcountries in Asia, including SAPTA point to the binding forces of greater integration ofIndia into Asia. Launching of negotiations of Free Trade Agreements between ASEANand India is of historic significance for carrying forward Asian Integration.24. As part of our policy of communication and to aid researchers and analysts theReserve Bank of India has been constructing a five-country and 36-country indices forNominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER).We have decided to review the REER and accordingly we expect a new six-countryindex to replace the present five-country one. The new index is likely to include theU.S.A., Eurozone, the U.K., Japan, China and Hong Kong. The new index would inthat case have two new currencies, both Asian, namely, the Renminbi and the HongKong Dollar. The 36-country index already includes the key Asian countries, but itsreview is likely to result in some enhancement of their weights. This reflects anincreasing recognition of the Indian economy’s rapidly growing integration with Asia.--
