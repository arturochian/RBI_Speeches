1 Non-Banking Finance Companies: Game Changers P. Vijaya Bhaskar  Executive Director, RBI    Introduction    The Indian financial sector consists of a wide variety of institutions which cater to different  market segments. At the apex level are scheduled commercial banks which follow universal  banking model. Next, there is the cooperative banking sector with two different strands.  While the three Tier rural co-operative structure (State/District/grassroot level outfits), takes  care predominantly of agriculture and allied activities; the urban co-operative banking  structure provides succour mainly to the small customers at the bottom of pyramid in urban  areas. On the other hand, Non-Bank Financial Companies (NBFCs) are largely involved in  serving those classes of borrowers who are generally excluded from the formal banking  sector. However, progressively over the years, the exclusiveness between the banks and  NBFCs has somewhat blurred. More recently, NBFCs are competing with banks in providing  financial services such as infrastructure finance and housing finance among others.    NBFCs, historically are involved in providing financial services such as offering of small  ticket personal loans, financing of two/three wheelers, truck financing, farm equipment  financing, loans for purchase of used commercial vehicles/machinery, secured/unsecured  working capital financing, etc.  Further, NBFCs also often take lead role in providing  innovative financial services to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) most suitable  to their business requirements. The characteristics of NBFC financial services include  simpler processes and procedures in sanction and disbursement of credit; timely, friendly  and flexible terms of repayment aligned to the unique features of its clientele, albeit at a  higher cost.    Theres an element of unavoidable overlap of functions, which in no way impinges on the  efficiency or effectiveness of the formal financial system in the country.    The speech is organised in six sections. Section 1 provides a profile of the NBFC Sector  while Section 2 deals with the extant regulatory framework for NBFCs. An analysis on  business trends of the NBFC sector is given at Section 3. The important role played by                                                    1 Speech delivered by Shri P Vijaya Bhaskar, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, at the National Summit  on Non-Banking Finance Companies  Game Changers on January 23, 2014 at New Delhi. The assistance  provided by Shri M. Sreeramulu, Assistant Adviser, DNBS, Reserve Bank of India is gratefully acknowledged. 1   NBFCs in promoting inclusive growth is the subject matter of Section 4. Section 5 highlights  the imperatives to be taken care of, by the industry as also the regulators, for NBFCs to  become real changers while the way forward and concluding thoughts are given in Section  6.    Section 1  Profile of NBFC Sector    1.1. Legal Definition of NBFC  A company is considered as an NBFC if it carries on as its business or part of its business,  any of the activities listed in Section 45 I (c ) of the RBI Act, 1934, viz.,  business of making  loans/advances or acquisition of shares / securities, etc. or hire purchase finance or  insurance business or chit fund activities or lending in any manner provided the principal  business of such a company does not constitute any of the following non-financial activities  viz. (a) agricultural operations (b) industrial activity (c) trading in goods  (other than  securities) (d) providing services (e) purchase, construction or sale of immovable property.   Further in terms of section 45 I (f) of the RBI Act, a company would also be an NBFC, if its  principal business is that of receiving deposits under any scheme or arrangement. Thus a  company whose principal business is agricultural operations, industrial activity, trading or  real estate business is not a financial institution.    The extremely diverse set of entities in the Non-Bank Finance Institution (NBFI) universe  and their respective regulators are shown in Chart 1 below.  2   Chart 1: The NBFI Universe        As depicted above, RBI classifies NBFCs into ten categories namely Asset Finance  Companies(AFCs), Loan Companies(LCs), Investment Companies(ICs), Infrastructure  Finance Companies(IFCs),Core Investment Companies(CICs), Infrastructure Debt  Funds(IDF-NBFCs), NBFC-Microfinance Institutions(NBFC-MFIs),Factoring  companies(FCs), Mortgage Guarantee Companies(MGCs) and Residuary Non-Banking  Companies(RNBCs).     1.2. Size of the Sector  The share of NBFCs assets in GDP (at current market prices) increased steadily from just  8.4 per cent as on March 31, 2006 to 12.5 per cent as on March 31, 2013; while the share of  bank assets increased from 75.4 per cent to 95.5 per cent during the same period (Table  1).In fact, if the assets of all the NBFCs below Rs.100 crore are reckoned, the share of  NBFCs assets to GDP would go further.          3   Table 1: Assets of NBFC and Banking (SCBs) Sectors as a % to GDP                Year  Ratio 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013  NBFC Assets to  GDP (%) 8.4 9.1 10.1 10.3 10.8 10.9 11.9 12.5  Bank Assets to  GDP (%) 75.4 80.6 86.8 93.0 93.0 92.2 92.7 95.5  Source: (i) Reports on Trend and Progress of Banking in India, 2006-2013; (ii) Hand Book of  Statistics on Indian Economy, 2012-13  Note: Assets of NBFC sector include assets of all deposit taking NBFCs and Non-Deposit Taking  NBFCs having assets size Rs. 100 crore and above (NBFCs-ND-SI)    In comparison to assets of the banking system (Scheduled Commercial Banks-SCBs), asset  size of NBFC sector was around 13 per cent; while deposits (including RNBCs) of the sector  were less than 0.15 per cent of bank deposits (SCBs) as on March 31, 2013 (Chart 2).  2 Public deposits held with the NBFC sector declined in line with RBI policy directions . The  decline in public deposits was largely on account of RNBCs. Due to concerted efforts of RBI,  the number of deposit taking NBFCs has come down from 428 in June 2006 to 254 in June  2013.      1.3. Business - Concentration  Unlike the banking sector, entities under NBFCs differ not only in terms of size and  sophistication of operations but also in terms of activities they undertake. NBFC would  include not only entities which are part of large multinational groups, but also small players  with assets around Rs.25 lakhs.                                                    2 Mid-term Review of Macro Economic and Monetary Developments: 2004-05:  Internationally, acceptance of public deposits is  restricted to banks, and non-banks including NBFCs raise resources from institutional sources or by accessing capital market.  NBFCs are encouraged to move in this direction in line with international practices. The Reserve Bank will be holding  discussions with NBFCs in regard to their plan of action for voluntarily phasing out of their acceptance of public deposits and  regulations on banks lending to NBFCs will be reviewed by RBI as appropriate. 4   The business concentration in terms of total assets and total credit based on Herfindahl 3 Hirschman Index (HHI) indicate that competition is greater in NBFC sector as compared  with banking sector, as HHI for NBFC sector was found to be on lower side for the period  ended March 2012 and March 2013.    2 Table 2: HerfindahlHirschman Index   NBFC Sector Banking Sector  Period  Total Assets Total Credit Total Assets Total Credit March 2012 372.4 591.8 508.5 545.2 March 2013 407.2 635.1 514.0 879.5 Source: Micro level data for NBFC sector has been extracted from COSMOS database of  Department of Non-Banking Supervision, while bank level data has been collected from Statistical  Tables Relating to Banks in India.      1.4. Non Bank Financial Institutions  Cross Country Analysis  Globally, the size of non-bank financial intermediation was equivalent to 117 percent of GDP  4 as at the end of 2012 for 20 jurisdictions and the euro area .  In absolute terms, total assets  of non-bank financial intermediaries remained at around $ 70 trillion as at end 2012.   US has the largest system of non-bank financial intermediation with assets of $ 26 trillion,  followed by the euro area ($ 22 trillion), the UK ($ 9 trillion) and Japan ($ 4 trillion).  On an average, the size of non-bank financial intermediation in terms of assets was  equivalent to 52 per cent of the banking system. However, there were significant cross- country differences, ranging from 10 per cent to 174 per cent.  Non-bank financial intermediation is relatively small in the case of emerging market  economies compared to the level of GDP. In India, Turkey, Indonesia, Argentina, Saudi  Arabia the amount of non-bank financial activity remained less than 20 per cent of the GDP  as at end 2012.  As such, the size of the non-banking financial sector in India is relatively low, by global  standards.                                                          3 A commonly accepted measure of concentration. It is calculated by squaring the share of each firm in total  assets (or credit), and then summing the resulting numbers. HHI result varies from 0 to 10,000, with 10,000  indicating monopoly and zero indicating perfect competition. If HHI result is less than 1,000 then the industry is  considered as competitive; a result of 1,000-1,800 to be a moderately concentrated; and a result of 1,800 or  greater to be a highly concentrated. 4  Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report 2013 (page no. 9) 5   Section 2  Extant Regulatory Framework for NBFCs  With the objective of designing comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework for  NBFCs, Chapter IIIB, IIIC and V of the RBI Act 1934 were amended in 1997.  The principles of regulation are broadly aimed at (i) protection of interests of depositors, (ii)  mitigating the systemic risks emanating from inter-connectedness with the rest of the  financial system, and (iii) Consumer Protection.  The extant regulatory framework for NBFCs is detailed in Annex-I.  On implementation of UT Committee Recommendations, the regulatory framework would get  further refined.    Section 3  Business Trends of the NBFC sector  An Analysis    3.1. Balance Sheet Growth  NBFC sector clocked phenomenal growth in the last ten years. The sector on an average,  witnessed a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 22 per cent during the period  between March 2006 and March 2013. Most of the years, NBFC sector grew faster than  banking sector (Chart 3).   NBFC sector exhibited counter cyclical movements in 2011-12. In other words, NBFC sector  clocked a growth of 25.7 per cent in 2011-12 although GDP growth decelerated to 6.3 per  cent in 2011-12 from 10.5 per cent in 2010-11.             6   3.2. Credit Growth  Credit growth across NBFC and banking sectors is presented in Chart 4. NBFC - credit grew  more rapidly as compared with the banking sector. NBFC credit witnessed a CAGR of 24.3  per cent during the period between March 2007 and March 2013 as against 21.4 per cent by  the banking sector.   Although Indian economy is slowing down in the recent past, the robust NBFC credit growth  is largely on account of significant growth in infrastructure credit and retail finance.      3.3. Financing of Infrastructure  By financing infrastructure projects, NBFCs broaden capital formation of the country and  thereby contribute to the overall economic growth and development of the country.   The quantum of infrastructure finance provided by the NBFC sector witnessed a CAGR of  26.2 per cent during the period between March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2013. In absolute  terms, NBFC finance to infrastructure increased from Rs.2228 billion on March 31, 2010 to  Rs. 4479 billion as on March 31, 2013 (Chart 4A).   NBFC finance to infrastructure accounted for 35.8 % of their assets as on March 31, 2013  while in case of banks it was 7.6%.      7       3.4. Public Deposits  In line with RBI directions, the public deposits of NBFC sector (including RNBCs) declined  considerably from Rs. 247 billion as on March 2007 to Rs.106 billion as on March 2013  (Chart 5).   The decline in public deposits is largely on account of RNBCs, which are going to exit from  NBFC business model by June 2015. The public deposits of RNBCs decreased from Rs.  202 billion as on March 31, 2007 to just Rs. 35 billion as on March 31, 2013.      3.5. Inter-connectedness with the Banking Sector  Borrowings from banks is one of the major sources of funding for the NBFCs. NBFC  borrowings from the banking sector increased manifold from Rs. 542 billion as on March 31,  2006 to Rs. 2508 billion in March 31, 2013 (an increase of more than 4 times).However,  8   5 growth of bank credit to NBFCs decelerated in March 2013 to 13.6 per cent from 32.5 per  cent and 42.8 per cent recorded in September 2012 and March 2012. This deceleration is  attributed to lower demand for auto and consumer loans, stricter norms on lending against  gold, withdrawal of priority sector status for some loans given by banks to NBFCs for on- lending for specific purposes, etc. Further, bank credit to NBFCs decelerated on account of  6 revised DBOD guidelines .    Macro-mapping of various financial instituitons is an absolute imperative to quantify the inter- connectedness among the institutions to measure systemic stability.      3.6. Borrowings from the Markets  7 Borrowings from the markets increased from just Rs. 1009 billion as on March 31, 2006 to  Rs.4764 billion as on March 31, 2013, increased by more than 4.5 times during the period of  8 years.  Among various sources, borrowings through NCDs constitute the largest source of finance  for the NBFC sector and its share in total funding sources remained at more than 30 per  cent. Since March 2010, funds raised through NCDs witnessed phenomenal growth largely  8 on account of (i) Infrastructure Finance Companies and (ii) gold loan NBFCs.                                                       5 Source: Financial Stability Report, Issue No.7, page no.25 6 The exposure (both lending and investment, including off balance sheet exposures) of a bank to a single NBFC  which is predominantly engaged in lending against collateral of gold jewellery (i.e. such loans comprising 50 per  cent or more of their financial assets), should not exceed 7.5 per cent of banks capital funds(Source:  DBOD.BP.BC.No.6/21.04.172/2013-14 dated July 1, 2013). 7  Market borrowings includes borrowings by way of issuing NCDs, commercial paper and inter-corporate deposits 8  Category of IFCs has been created in Feb 2010.  9   The quantum of finance raised through NCDs increased from Rs. 682 billion as on March 31,  2006 to Rs.4044 billion as on March 31, 2013. In order to promote discipline in resource  raising, the Bank has issued guidelines on private placement of NCDs in June 2013.         3.7. Profitability  Trends in Return on Assets (RoA) of NBFC sector are furnished in Chart 8; comparative  figures for banks are also indicated for banking sector. The RoA of NBFC sector is always  found to be on the higher side as compared with that of the banking sector largely on  account of lower operating costs and also, NBFCs do not have statutory pre-emptions like  CRR and SLR.        10   3.8.To sum up, the NBFC sector has exhibited robust growth in the face of declining GDP by  resorting to higher market borrowings, predominantly NCDs; while public deposits have  declined in tandem with RBI policy. The sectors profitability continues to be consistently  higher than that of the banking sector. Simultaneously, inter-connectedness with the banking  sector and other segments of financial markets has increased due to credit and other  linkages, which needs to be watched closely by regulators in the context of financial stability.    Section 4  Role of NBFCs in Promoting Inclusive Growth  NBFCs play an important role in promoting inclusive growth in the country, by catering to the  diverse financial needs of bank excluded customers. By financing real assets and extending  credit to infrastructure projects, NBFCs play a pro-active role in the development process of  the country. Activities undertaken by the NBFCs for achieving inclusive growth in the country  are described below:    4.1. Credit to MSMEs  MSME sector has large employment potential of 59.7 million persons over 26.1 million  enterprises and is considered as an engine for economic growth and promoting financial  inclusion in rural areas. The outstanding credit provided by the NBFC sector to MSMEs  9 stood at Rs.625 billion as at end March 2013 (Rs.464 billion in the previous year). The  10 figures for banking sector were at Rs.22,302 billion as at end March 2013 (Rs.19,374 in  the previous year).  th Statistics based on 4 Census on MSME sector revealed that only 5.18% of the units  (both registered and un-registered) had availed finance through institutional sources.  2.05% got finance from non-institutional sources the majority of units say 92.77%  had no finance or depended on self-finance.  The fact that a large segment in the micro and small industries sector does not have  access to formal credit provides a window of opportunity for the NBFCs to design  suitable innovative products.                                                            9 Source: Consolidated based on the returns submitted by the NBFCs to Dept. of Non-Banking Supervision,  Reserve Bank of India 10  Source: Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy 11   4.2. Micro Finance Institutions  NBFC-MFIs provide access to basic financial services such as loans, savings, money  transfer services, micro-insurance etc. to poor people and attempt to fill the void left between  the mainstream commercial banks and money lenders.  Over the last few years NBFC-MFIs have emerged as a fast growing enablers in providing  the financial services to the poor people by providing capital inputs to poor which generates  self-employment, and thereby promotes inclusive growth.   11 The credit provided by the NBFCs - MFIs increased from just Rs. 105 billion as on March  2010 to Rs.151 billion as on March 2011 and declined to Rs.117billion on account of the  ordinance passed by the AP Government that stopped all MFIs from collecting payments by  force or even disbursing loans by the MFIs. However, in March 2013, the outstanding credit  disbursed by the MFIs increased to Rs.144 billion due to partial resumption of MFI activities,  owing to implementation of the Malegam Committee recommendations and certain Supreme  Court orders favourable for MFIs.      To encourage MFIs, as per the Malegam committee recommendations, RBI has created  separate category under NBFCs. As on date, around 33 MFIs have been registered with  RBI.     4.3. Monetisation of Gold  Gold loan NBFCs provide loans against security of gold jewellery. Although banks are also  involved in gold loan business, NBFCs gold loans witnessed phenomenal growth due to                                                    11 DatapertainstoNBFCswhicharepredominantlyengagedinMicroFinanceactivitieshavebeen consolidatedbasedonthereturnssubmittedbythemtoDept.ofNon?BankingSupervision 12   their customer friendly approaches like simplified sanction procedures, quick loan  disbursement etc.  Branches of gold loan NBFCs increased significantly during the last couple of years mostly  housed at semi-urban and rural centres of the country.  Gold loan NBFCs help in monetisation of idle gold stocks in the country and facilitate in  creating productive resources. Credit extended by the gold loan NBFCs witnessed a CAGR  of 86.7 per cent during the period March 2009 to March 2013. In absolute terms, NBFC gold  loans increased from just Rs. 39 billion as on March 31, 2009 to Rs.475 billion as on March  31, 2013.  CAGR = 86.7%      To study the issues related to the gold loans by NBFCs a working group was set up under  the chairman ship of K.U.B. Rao which submitted its report in January 2013. Several  recommendations have since been accepted and acted upon.    4.4. Second Hand Vehicle Financing    Apart from providing loan against property, NBFCs also engage in financing used/ second  hand vehicles, reconditioned vehicle, three-wheelers, construction equipment besides  secured/unsecured working capital financing etc.  Incidentally, in India except NBFCs no other financial sector player finance second hand  vehicles; which are very popular with road transport operators essentially in the self- employed segment.  13       4.5 Affordable Housing  Another area where NBFCs are participating in the inclusive growth agenda is affordable  housing. Large NBFCs are setting up units to extend small-ticket loans to home buyers  targeting low-income customers across the country. Firms are offering loans of Rs. 2-6 lakh  to borrowers with monthly income of Rs.6000  12000 who find it difficult to borrow from the  commercial banks. Firms offer easier know-your customer (KYC) norms such as relaxation  in documentation requirements to facilitate easy access to low-income borrowers. The  trends in housing loans provided by the Housing Finance NBFCs are furnished below.    Housing finance NBFCs are real game changers in terms of providing housing loans at par  with Public Sector Banks (PSB). The quantum of housing loans provided by the housing  finance NBFCs is almost the same although they are comparatively far smaller than PSBs  (Chart 13).      14   4.6.To sum up, NBFCs role in financial inclusion as explained above, indicate the fact that  they have been game changers in certain areas like financial inclusion especially micro  finance, affordable housing, second-hand vehicle finance, gold loans and infrastructure  finance.    NBFCs can truly become game changers provided they exhibit the requisite nimbleness and  innovative zeal in reaching a complete suite of financial products such as shares, mutual  funds, depository services etc., as also insurance products  both life and non-life together  with their current product offerings, to the common man.  In respect of MSMEs, NBFCs can become game changers by providing factoring and bill  payment services which are of crucial importance at the present juncture of financial sector  development.    Section 5  Imperatives for NBFCs to become Real Game Changers    A. Action Points for the Industry  The following issues need to be addressed on priority basis in order to morph themselves as  real game changers.    5.1 Customer Protection Issues  Protection of customers against unfair, deceptive or fraudulent practices has become top  priority internationally after the crisis. Incidentally, the Bank has received and is receiving  number of complaints against charging of exorbitant interest rates, raising of surrogate  deposits under the garb of non-convertible debentures, various types of preference shares,  Tier II Bonds, etc. Aggressive practices in re-possessing of automobiles in the case of auto  loans and improper/opaque practices in selling the underlying gold jewellery in the case of  gold loans are the two categories in which relatively more complaints are received / are  being received by the Reserve Bank. NBFCs are often found not to practice Fair Practices  Code(FPC) in letter and spirit. Developing a responsive and proper grievance redressal  mechanism is the more important agenda in the context of this action point.    5.2 Camouflaging Public Deposits  NBFCs have been prone to adopt variety of instruments/ways of accepting camouflaged  public deposits for resource mobilisation viz., use of Cumulative Redeemable Preference  15   Shares (CRPS)/ Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) / NCDs / Tier 2 capitals. These  instruments are generally marketed as any other deposit products mostly by agents.  Regulators should distinguish tiny differences in a clear manner to check and control NBFCs  which are raising resources through camouflaged public deposits.     Furthermore, complaints are received that deposit receipts issued to customers   reveal that  the deposits are accepted on behalf of other group companies, whose operations are neither  known / are opaque.    5.3 Improving Corporate Governance Standards  To become real game changers, business transparency is inevitable for any financial entity.  In the case of NBFCs, there is an imperative for adopting good corporate governance  practices. RBI has already prescribed a governance code for NBFCs as part of their best  practices; these include constitution of Risk Management, Audit and Nomination  Committees, disclosure and transparency. When due diligence was undertaken on  significant shareholders and directors at the time of registration it was observed there are no  prescriptions for qualifications for directors, change in directors etc.     5.4 Capacity Building  NBFCs on both individual and collective basis need to work towards building a responsive  ecosystem for capacity building; since in the medium to long term, it is the quality of staff  which to a large extent, determines the health of the sector.     5.5 Greater Innovation  Although NBFCs have been designing innovative products to suit the client and market  conditions, the sophistication of financial services has been gradually increasing in the  recent past. There is an imperative need for NBFCs to aggressively involve in designing  innovative products to become real game changers in the economy.   In this context, a cue may be taken from the description of daily financial lives of poor  people given in detail in Portfolios of the Poor, a prominent investigation into the everyday  problems which they face (Collins, Kulkarni and Gavron (2009)). It is stated therein that  typical low income families used some 10 different financial instruments, several channels of  transport for money and multiple ways of keeping money safe. Their fundamental protection  against financial risk is diversification, knowledge about counterparties and the judicious  exploitation of relationships that are expected to last. NBFCs should closely study such  behaviour of poor people taking advantage of the last mile connectivity which they do  possess, to craft innovative products.    16   5.6 White Label ATMs  As NBFCs already have significant business presence in semi-urban and rural centres, there  is a case for them to explore business potential by establishing white label ATMs in such  areas.    5.7 Need for a single representative body for the Industry  In the case of NBFCs, there are multiple representative bodies such as Finance Industry  Development Council (FIDC) for Assets Finance Companies, Association of Gold Loan  Companies (AGLOC) for Gold Loan NBFCs, etc. In addition, RBI has recently issued  guidelines for Self-Regulatory Organisation for Micro Finance Institutions. At this stage of  development of the NBFC sector, in the interests of harmonious development of all its  segments, establishing one representative body for the entire sector would be an idea worth  exploring by subsuming the existing bodies. However, care should be taken to ensure that  all segments are adequately represented in such an apex body, to promote harmonious and  balanced growth of the sector and avoid internecine conflicts.    5.8 Coparceners with RBI and Other Regulators    NBFCs should become coparceners with RBI and other regulators and disclose the  challenges they are confronting in the markets and provide valuable inputs to regulators for  developing conducive regulatory environment.    B. Role of Regulators  Regulators too need to act on certain issues to enable the NBFC sector to become Real  Game Changers.  5.9. Regulators as Consumer Advocates and as Also Prudential Regulators  In the context of NBFCs, customer protection issues take the centre stage as can be seen  from paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3 above. Hence regulators need to wear two hats in the context of  NBFCs viz. being consumer advocates as also prudential regulators.  The need to become consumer advocates need hardly any overemphasis in the context of  the various issues highlighted in paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3 above.  As regards the role of a prudential regulator, they need to take care of individual NBFCs  (micro prudential) as also the system as a whole (macro prudential regulations).    5.10. Enhanced Monitoring  The regulators should have a hands-on approach in unearthing the activities of unauthorised  entities as also authorised entities undertaking non-permitted activities. In this context,  17   wherever possible, laws may need to be amended to bestow the requisite regulatory and  supervisory powers to the respective regulators.    5.11. Regulatory convergence  All the concerned regulators should bring about regulatory convergence among themselves,  to avoid any possible regulatory arbitrage by the players.    5.12. Higher level of co-ordination  All the regulators should actively strive to bring about higher level co-ordination amongst  themselves on a continuous basis, so that regulatory gaps and overlaps could be identified  at the very earliest and immediate corrective action taken thereon           Section 6  The Way Forward & Concluding Thoughts    NBFCs are already game changers, as can be seen from the analysis above in  areas of financial inclusion, especially micro finance, affordable housing, second  hand vehicle finance, gold loans and infrastructure finance. NBFCs can play a vital  role going forward, in closing the loop as regards financial inclusion for individuals  and MSMEs. As regards individuals, NBFCs can reach various financial products  offered by the securities industry, viz., shares, mutual funds, depository services etc.,  as also insurance products both life and non-life together with their current product  offerings. As regards MSMEs, NBFCs can become game changers by providing  factoring and bill payment service which are of critical importance at the present  juncture.    The way forward is to ensure that both the NBFI sector and all the concerned  regulators play an active part in attending on the imperatives mentioned at Section 5  above. The complimentary role of the financial sector and all the regulators hardly  needs overemphasis in the context of NBFCs morphing as game changers for  providing the last mile connectivity and closing the loop as regards financial  inclusion. In this context, NBFCs have a special responsibility against the  background of the need to improve the customer service by conducting their  18   operations as per the best practices of corporate governance. In the ultimate  analysis, adhering to   best corporate governance and ethical practices is the only  way for gaining the confidence of their customers in particular, and the society in  general. Consequently, the NBFC sector would be able to garner greater trust of  both its customers and the society.
