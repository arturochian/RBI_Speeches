Reserve Bank’s approach to financial inclusion aimed at connecting people with the mainstream financial  institutions.  ? RBI had chosen the bank-led model for financial inclusion- Leveraging  on technology.  ?

RBI encouraged the ICT model which would enable banks to circumvent the barriers of geography and ensure efficient Financial Inclusion.  ?

Technology issues- availability of handheld devices, cards, technology partners, operational glitches, Digital connectivity, Turnaround time.  ? Engaging BCs- Associated risks - Lack of professionalism of BCs. ? BC attrition- Inadequate remuneration- Non payment of commission.   12 ? Monetary Policy Actions – Mandated SLBCs to prepare a roadmap for covering all unbanked villages of population less than 2,000 and allot these villages to banks for providing banking services in a time-bound manner.  ? Advised banks to open intermediate brick and mortar structure between the base branch and BC locations. These structures having minimum infrastructure like a CBS terminal, pass book printer,  safe for cash retention, etc. will be at a reasonable distance of 3-4 kilometers and will provide support to about 8-10 BC units – Will lead to efficiency in cash management, documentation, redressal of customer grievances. ? Satellite offices in the form of Ultra Small BC outlets are also mandated and being encouraged ? Advised sponsor banks to formulate Financial Inclusion Plans for RRBs. Progress to be monitored by NABARD and Regional Offices of RBI.  ? Disaggregation of FIP from Head Office to branch level- Banks already advised to put in place a mechanism to monitor the progress at the branch level periodically.  13 ? Financial Literacy & Financial Inclusion should go together ? Financial Stability Development Council has been mandated to focus on Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy. ? A technical group on Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy under aegis of FSDC is coordinating  the efforts of all Financial Sector regulators. ? Discussion with NCERT/CBSE and State Boards- Efforts on to include financial education curriculum in school education. ? Financial Literacy Centres to be set up in all 630+ LDM offices – All rural branches of Scheduled Commercial Banks to undertake FL activities. ? National strategy on financial education being prepared.  14 ? Achievements cannot be ignored - Nearly 100 Million no frills accounts have been opened by banks so far. When we started, we were all saying people have no bank accounts, now with bank accounts being opened we are complaining that there are no transactions in these accounts. Banks need to be given time for making these NFAs active.  ? Banks must be able to see Financial Inclusion as a business opportunity. The Technology is critical for this as brick and mortar branches would not be cost effective and that is why BC- ICT model is the key.  ? The market players i.e. banks must be allowed to discover the business and delivery model. To ensure that banks do not get complacent they should be actively encouraged to set targets for themselves and for capturing untapped business in rural areas rdcovering approximately 2/3 population of the country. ? EBT, Remittances and credit products will play a key role in making  this experiment a commercial success.   15 ? All stakeholders like RBI, Other sectoral regulators like SEBI, IRDA, PFRDA, etc., NABARD, Banks, Governments, Civil Societies, NGOs, etc. to work  together for a sound and purposeful collaboration.   ? Adequate infrastructure such as digital and physical connectivity, uninterrupted power supply, etc. will  boost the financial inclusion initiatives.  ? If the EBT scheme succeeds and if Banks are allowed to develop the business and delivery models, operations through BCs would become viable and the number of transactions in these accounts will increase. ? Demand side initiatives - Create awareness, literacy, national strategy, Curriculum in schools at national level.  ? Sensitization - Efforts to be made so as to bring about cultural and attitudinal changes in the mindset of all stakeholders.  16  Banking in all  6 We have got an lakh villages - A  opportunity to big challenge, but  contribute a bit in definitely changing  lives  of   achievable under privileged  Let us put our heart into it – Pursue as personal agenda.  make it a passion of our life 17
