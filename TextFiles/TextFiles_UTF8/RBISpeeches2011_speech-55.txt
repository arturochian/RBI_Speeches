? Economic Reforms for Sustainable Growth   (Presentation by Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the  175th  Annual General Meeting of the Madras Chamber of Commerce & Industry,  23rd June 2011 at Chennai)    I. Introduction  th It is a great pleasure and privilege for me to be speaking at the 175 Annual General  Meeting of the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I have had the opportunity  to speak at previous events organized by the Chamber, and also interact with  committee members and the secretariat during my tenure as the chairperson of the  Economic Affairs Committee of ASSOCHAM. But, this is a special occasion and I thank  the Chamber for inviting me to speak on a topic that has been close to my heart and  mind for many years now.  An organization that has been in existence and, by all indications, thrived for 175 years  clearly knows a thing or two about sustainability. It has, presumably, through trial and  error, figured out what it needs to change and what it needs to retain in order to remain  relevant and useful to its individual stakeholders. To be meaningful, sustainable growth  has to be viewed from the perspective of the individual. Ultimately, it is individuals or  households who determine whether the growth process has benefitted them or not. In  short, just as the durability of an institution such as the MCCI depends on how  effectively it serves the interests of its members, so also does the sustainability of a  growth process depend on how effectively it serves the interests of its core stakeholders   the individuals and households in the economy.  This is the broad perspective with which I plan to address todays topic. In what follows,  I will address four issues - food, human capital, infrastructure and financial sector  development - in which I believe reforms are critical to the sustainability of the growth  process in the way I have defined it. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. I am  acutely aware that there are many other issues, which have a legitimate claim to be on  anybodys list of reform priorities. I have chosen my list based on my understanding and  knowledge of them and not because I believe they are decisively more important than  others that have been excluded. Nor am I claiming to offer panaceas by way of reform  ideas. Given complex inter-linkages, many solutions that may seem perfectly   ?   Inputs from Bhupal Singh are gratefully acknowledged.  1 reasonable in a limited context break down when the context is widened. However,  despite all these caveats, I will assert that these are all critical reform agendas and it is  worth debating and refining the solutions that emerge.       II. Food  Food inflation is a significant negative feature of todays economic environment. It has a  tremendous impact on quality of life, as people struggle to maintain nutritional standards  that they had previously achieved, or give up some other forms of consumption so as to  keep themselves well-fed. For a country that legitimately believed that it had effectively  dealt with its vulnerability to food shortages in the form of the Green Revolution of the  late 1960s and early 1970s, the current situation comes as a rude reminder that  solutions are rarely permanent.   To place the current developments in context, it must be pointed out that the world  economy is itself facing problems with food prices. As Chart 1 shows, food as a  category has been following global trends in commodity prices over the past couple of  years. There is a view that this is the outcome of the larger trend towards  financialization of commodities, wherein large increases in global liquidity as a response  to the 2008 crisis feed directly into higher asset prices, including commodities. Be that  as it may, the price dynamics of individual food items, also displayed on Chart 1,  suggest that there are also some commodity-specific factors at work, which may either  reinforce or counteract the broader trend. Sugar, for example, shows fluctuations in  response to current supply conditions, while wheat reflects the effect of persistent  drought in some major cultivating areas.   Indias food inflation is certainly linked to global trends, particularly in relatively heavily  traded commodities like sugar and oilseeds, but, given the high degree of self-reliance  in many other commodities, domestic factors play a big role. Chart 2 shows the  significance of food inflation in the overall domestic inflation scenario. As the graph  suggests, although the drivers of inflation in recent months have been energy prices  and demand pressures, as reflected in the non-food manufactured products index, food  prices contributed significantly in the first half of 2010 and remain uncomfortably high.  Apart from the direct impact on the index, it is also likely to feed through into the wider  inflationary process through higher wage demands, of which there is some evidence.   It is generally believed that food prices are highly sensitive to monsoon performance,  but this belief has been tested over the past few years. I think there is sufficient  evidence to suggest that food prices are being driven not by transitory factors, such as  rainfall, but my more fundamental forces. Essentially, a long period of relatively rapid  growth has taken large numbers of households across a threshold at which they begin  2 to look for nutritional diversification. The predominance of cereals in the typical  household diet gives way to greater balance and a consequent increase in the demand  for proteins  pulses, milk, meat, fish and eggs - , vegetables and fruit. It is no surprise  that these items have been the primary causes of food inflation in the recent period.   Further, as Chart 3 clearly shows, as far as proteins are concerned there is a significant  deviation from an earlier trend, with no significant sign of reverting to the more moderate  trend, unlike non-protein items. The implication is that, as long as growth is leading to  rising household incomes, particularly at the lower end of the income distribution, the  pressure on food prices resulting from nutritional diversification will continue.  The enduring solution to persistent demand-supply imbalances in food is to rapidly  increase supply. This is exactly what the Green Revolution did. The combination of  inputs that achieved that success is well-known and some lessons may yet be relevant.  The basic principles, however, are quite clear. Production of the relevant items has to  be increased, mostly by increasing productivity. Cultivation risks have to be mitigated for  farmers to find these products more attractive. Transportation, storage and distribution  efficiency have to be increased to keep losses and distribution margins down. These  may seem obvious points, even clichs, but there is no getting around them. There will  be some generic strategies and some crop-specific ones, which makes it worthwhile to  approach the problem from a wider perspective. A first step has been taken by the  Government in setting up the National Mission on Protein Supplements, from which a  concrete action plan needs to emerge quickly. In its absence, the likely scenario is one  of persistent food inflation and, from the all-important perspective of quality of life,  persistent nutritional imbalances. This is not a recipe for sustainable growth.    III. Human Capital  India is the second most populous country in the world and will become the most  populous in a couple of decades. It is also one of the youngest and will remain so for  some decades to come. At one level, this demographic dividend provides an  enormous opportunity. Chart 4 shows the contrasting demographic transition in India  and China over the next two decades. The Chinese growth story over the past three  decades has been well chronicled and I dont want to go into it here, except to make the  point that a critical input into the sustained high growth was the abundance of labour. Of  course, other policies contributed, but they can all be seen in terms of how they  facilitated the absorption of large numbers of workers from the farms into the factories.   The main point that Chart 4 makes is that the Chinese pool of workers is going to shrink  as the population ages over the next two decades, during which period India will add a  substantial number of workers. While China will lose about 40 million workers between  3 2010 and 2030 as they move past the age of 60, India will actually add 220 million  workers. In terms of competitive advantage, this is an opportunity to take over the  mantle factory to the world, with hundreds of millions of relatively low-cost workers  producing goods that the rest of the world will consume. In fact, as Chart 5 shows very  clearly, India will dominate the global pool of workers as Chinas population ages,  because no other country that is likely to face the same level of labour costs as India, is  anywhere close to having that number of people. If the hub of global manufacturing is to  move from China, realistically speaking, it can only move to India, or to expand the  geographic scope somewhat, South Asia  However, the mere fact that the economy has a large number of potential workers  doesnt guarantee that they will be employed in desirable, relatively high-productive,  well-paying jobs. There is nothing automatic about the process, which is what makes  the other policies that facilitate and support it extremely important. This is where some  questions about Indias ability to replicate the process arise.  A basic concern is the quality of the workforce. Chart 6 provides a comparative picture  of the most basic workforce quality parameter, i.e., whether workers have been through  secondary school. Evidently, despite significant improvements in Indias record, it lags a  long distance behind China and the South-East Asian economies, all of which have  been, or still are, manufacturing powerhouses. Of course, the mere fact of having  finished school does not guarantee that a worker can be productively employed.  Vocational, job-oriented training may be a necessary part of equipping workers to  function. Data on these indicators are sketchy, but anecdotal evidence suggest that this  is not a very large pipeline and, in its current state, can hardly hope to make a dent on  the large numbers of potential workers today, let alone the surge that is anticipated over  the next two decades.   Partly as a result of this, but also due to some other factors, some of which will be  addressed in the next section, Indias record in moving people from farm to factory has  not been very good. As Chart 7 shows, over the 1993-94 period, the structure of  economic activity changed significantly. While the share of agriculture declined, the  share of services increased and that of industry virtually remained the same. The  decline in the share of agriculture is a universal historical pattern, but the transition of  the share predominantly to services is unique to India.  But, that is a separate issue.  What is striking in Chart 7 is that the transition in the workforce has been far less  significant. Over 55 per cent of the workforce remained in agriculture, with the decline in  this sectors share being equally absorbed by industry and services.   In 1993-94,  agriculture, with 30 per cent of GDP, was providing employment and livelihood to 65 per  cent of the workforce. By 2007-08, the same sector accounted for less than 17 per cent  of GDP, but continued to support 55 per cent of the workforce. In short, the workforce  4 did not restructure as rapidly as the economy did, indicating the inability of the non- agricultural sectors to absorb workers.  How much did this impact livelihood and inequality in the economy? A simple  calculation gives some indication. Chart 8 displays the absolute and relative levels of  average labour productivity across the three sectors, agriculture, industry and services.  Although these are very crude measures of productivity differentials, the magnitudes are  suggestive. The graph shows that the average worker in industry or services is about 5  times as productive as the average worker in agriculture, which means that the ratio of  their earnings must be about the same order of magnitude. In other words, in terms of  this simple arithmetic, every worker shifting from agriculture to industry or services  would contribute four more units of GDP, besides spending and saving more out of  higher earnings.   As crude as the arithmetic may be, the point is clear. Accelerating growth in a way that  is sustainable will inevitably involve moving workers from agriculture to industry and  services.  However, the past pace of transition does not provide much reassurance that  the Indian economy does this very well. Facilitating the transition is, therefore, a critical  requirement for sustainable growth. In my view, three things are absolutely necessary  for this to happen.    First, there is evidence to suggest that job security regulations in the manufacturing  deter employers from hiring workers. There are clearly ways around this, but since they  exist, their deterrent effect is probably being felt. Second, if job security is eliminated,  workers must have access to a safety net of unemployment insurance. By all accounts,  the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is  providing a tangible safety net for rural workers. It is time to think of cost-effective ways  to extend safety net access to industrial workers as a concomitant to scaling down job  security regulations. Third, large numbers of workers have to be trained and equipped  to work in modern industrial environments. Whether this is to be done through traditional  schooling or alternative methods is a matter of debate, but the primary objective should  be to move from generic knowledge to work-oriented skills. The numbers involved  indicate that the whole exercise is going to be a huge organizational and financial  challenge, but it must be faced.    IV. Infrastructure  The third critical area for reforms, to my mind, is infrastructure. The problems in most  infrastructure sectors are well-known and can be summarized in a couple of sentences.  Rapid growth has raised demand for infrastructure services far in excess of available  5 capacity. Meanwhile, a combination of policy, regulatory and financial factors has  slowed the pace of investment in infrastructure, leading to a persistence of the gap.   We can look at this basic condition of shortage from a variety of perspectives. Charts 9  and Chart 10 provide some indications of the gaps that currently exist. Chart 9  reinforces the general perception of severe power shortages across the country. The  Northern and Western regions are relatively dynamic in terms of their growth  momentum and the magnitude of shortage that is estimated for them may prove to be  significant drag on growth. Of course, since the deficit has persisted for some time,  most establishments look for alternatives in the form of captive power. However, this is  relatively costly, not to mention more dependent on diesel, which then contributes to an  increase in petroleum demand, which has both fiscal and balance of payments  consequences. The Chart also provides an indication of how much distance there is to  cover in providing the country a comprehensive four-lane highway system, the absence  of which is leading to huge inefficiencies in the national transportation system.  The impact of inadequate supply of power and transport infrastructure on manufacturing  activity is quite significant. This sector, in general, is infrastructure-intensive and any  increase in costs due to unreliable or privately provided infrastructure services tends to  reduce the competitiveness of producers. Since virtually all manufactured goods are  tradable, inefficient domestic cost structures put producers at a disadvantage not only in  global markets but also in their home markets, where they have to compete against  imports. This is a significant reason why the Industrial sector's share of GDP has  virtually remained the same over a long period of time. This is in sharp contrast to  virtually all other economies, particularly those in East Asia, whose industrial sectors  acted as engines of growth, resulting in a large increase in their share of GDP over  comparably long periods.   Chart 10 focuses on parameters that impinge very directly on quality of life, access to  water and sanitation. These statistics suggest that access to water is relatively high, but  sanitation is a different matter altogether. It is no comfort that on this one parameter,  India and China are quite close to each other. Over 45 per cent of India's population is  estimated to be without access to sanitation facilities, a gap that presumably vitiates  many of the quality of life improvements arising from higher earnings and better access  to a range of goods and services.  This leads to a larger point about urban infrastructure. As we look ahead at the country's  population trajectory, apart from the aggregates, it is very important to keep in mind that  there is likely to be a significant shift from rural areas to urban areas. Chart 11 provides  projections of the incremental contribution to the world urban population expected to  come from India and China over the next few decades. Evidently, Indian cities are going  to become the repository of a very large number of the young workers that the country  6 will add to its workforce during this period. In a situation in which cities are already  reeling under enormous pressure on all urban systems because of rapidly increasing  population, their ability to cope with even larger numbers without both more resources  and significant increases in their organizational and managerial capacities is doubtful.  In a nutshell, the infrastructure problem has two dimensions - sectoral and geographic.  Each needs distinct focus in order to arrive at meaningful solutions. As far as sectoral  imbalances are concerned, there are fortunately areas in which significant progress has  been made. Over a period of time, policy clarity has been achieved and appropriate  regulatory structures have been or are being put into place. This, in turn, has created  the space for significant private investment to flow in, typically though not always in  partnership with the public sector. In fact, for the past two years or more, infrastructure  has been the largest contributor to growth in bank credit. This has given rise to some  problems, which I shall address in the next section, but, it is a reassuring sign that new  infrastructure capacity is being created.   As the supply-demand gaps in a variety of sectors close, the stress that they impose on  industrial investment will ease. Conditions will be created for new industrial capacity to  be created, unburdened by uncertain or high-cost infrastructure services. This, in turn,  should facilitate the movement of workers from relatively low-productivity agriculture to  relatively high-productivity manufacturing, provided that the policy framework indicated  in the human capital discussion are put into place.  However, the urbanization scenario raises concerns. If the ultimate goal of sustained  growth is to create enduring improvements in the quality of life of as many people as  possible, this is not going to be achieved if urban systems do not keep pace with the  number of entrants. Fortunately, there are a number of initiatives in place that at least  provide the prospect for the needed improvement. These are both top-down and  bottom-up approaches. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission  (JNNURM) is the primary example of the former, in which the central government  provides resources for urban investments, subject to explicit accountability standards as  well as resource commitments by city governments.   In the bottom-up category, many cities have launched initiatives to digitize their land  records, which immediately enhance the capacity to collect property taxes, always a  significant source of revenue for cities. Simplification of tax formulae and procedures is  another aspect of urban governance reform. Rationalization of user charges for civic  services, the use of private agents to provide some services, e.g., waste management  and so on are all ways in which cities are going about the task of improving service  delivery to their current residents as well as creating the capacity to do so for  newcomers.  7 As reassuring and promising as all these programmes and initiatives are, they do not  seem to be at a scale matching the enormity of the challenge.  A significant  restructuring of urban governance framework, which helps build the capacity to meet  the challenge, is therefore a reform priority in this domain. There is plenty to learn from  the experience of other countries where the quality of urban environment is noticeably  superior to that in India. Some broad guidelines may include, for example, greater  powers to tax with a consequent decrease in the dependence on higher tiers of  government, and the creation of a professional cadre of urban management specialists,  who spend their entire career running the city and can rise to levels of seniority  comparable to other government hierarchies. Of course, cities exist in a socio-cultural  context, so no model is strictly transplantable, but that does not mean that some widely  applicable principles do not exist.  There have been other kinds of suggestions specifically in the Indian context, e.g., to  convert the larger cities into Union Territories to give them some autonomy from political  economy forces at the state level, which also tend to favour rural areas due to simple  electoral arithmetic. Such ideas are worth examining. But certainly, any means of giving  cities both greater autonomy in resource mobilization, along with greater managerial  capability need to be pursued, even if this is to be achieved within the existing federal  framework.    V. The Financial Sector   Looking back over the past 20 years, there have clearly been massive changes in the  financial sector, which have completely changed the nature of intermediation, the range  of products and services available and the intensity of competition. This has clearly  been in sync with the overall development and structural change of the economy. The  financial sector has had the space to service the requirements of an increasing number  of individuals and organizations. However, the process is clearly far from complete. It is  useful to think of financial sector reforms as a perpetual work-in-progress, in which  policy and regulation need to create space for service providers to cater to increasing  and new customer requirements, while ensuring that existing and emerging risks are  monitored and mitigated.  This topic could be the basis of a full-length speech by itself, but I clearly don't want to  do that here. I will confine myself to two sets of issues - financial inclusion and the  development of a corporate bond market.   Expanding the reach of financial services to those individuals who do not currently have  access is an objective that is fully consistent with the people-centric definition of  sustainable growth. Going by the evidence, there is a long way to go in achieving this  8 objective. Chart 12 provides a picture of the current levels of access to different financial  products and services. Bank accounts are relatively widespread, but even in that most  basic of services, the gap is quite large. Other services have very low levels of  penetration. Of course, high penetration depends on demand conditions as well and not  everyone may want or need every kind of product or service, but, as subsequent Charts  will suggest, the unmet demand for some kinds of services may be quite large.  Chart 13 makes the point that a very high proportion of household financial assets are  held in cash, which suggest that the ability of many households to access the financial  system is low. This is, understandably, even higher in rural areas than in the urban  ones. Bank deposits are clearly providing an alternative to cash, which is a positive  development, but the room for improvement is clearly visible in the picture.   The Reserve Bank has been emphasising on expanding the access to the banking  system. The broad objective is to ensure access to all households in villages with a  population over 2000 (as per the 2001 Census) by 2012. The extensive use of  technology facilitates this by allowing banks to operate virtual branches in the form of an  IT-enabled Business Correspondent (BC). This model shows some promise as it rolls  out across the country, and also some limitations. It is reasonably clear that the BC  model is not infinitely scalable. Banks have to innovate in terms of their own  organizational structures and support systems to increase the viability and sustainability  of the model. But, even with all these concerns, it is a good beginning and the generic  model, with appropriate adaptations to local conditions, is the most likely way to achieve  at least minimal access to the financial system through a basic or no-frills  bank  account. This is visualized as the beginning of the process; once the customer is in the  system, it can begin to address his or her other needs by adapting existing products or  designing new ones.  What other products may interest this new pool of financial service customers? One  way to gauge this is to identify the reasons for people to use financial services.        Chart 14, reporting results from a recent survey of households, provides some important  insights on this. Ceremonies or social obligations, old-age security, children's education  and meeting emergency needs are four of the most important motivations for accessing  financial services. Clearly, there is a role for insurance, pension and other long-term  savings instruments in advancing the cause of financial inclusion. It is in these  segments that penetration is extremely low. Chart 15 provides a cross-country  comparison of insurance services. It speaks for itself.  What is needed here is to develop last-mile delivery mechanisms that can take these  products from the large providers in the formal sector to this vast pool of new  customers. Though volumes are potentially large, individual transactions will be small  and geographically scattered, which can play havoc with costs. Organizational  9 structures, whether within the existing providers or independent, have to be developed  to accommodate these specific market conditions. From a regulatory perspective, the  massive expansion of services brings with it risks and these have to be identified and  provided for.   I will now turn to the issue of the corporate bond market. To provide a backdrop,      Chart 16 shows the estimated financial requirements for infrastructure over the 12th  Plan period, 2012-17. Over the next five years, over Rs. 40 lakh crores or $ 1 trillion are  desired to be invested. As I indicated earlier, infrastructure supply is a serious  bottleneck and large, efficiently implemented and well managed projects across sectors  are imperative. Even as these are getting under way, there is an obvious lack of  financial channels for them to mobilize resources. So far, the responsibility for financing  new investments has fallen predominantly on banks. For reasons relating to asset- liability management and sector exposure limits, the capacity of banks to continue to  finance this sector is limited. Therefore, alternative channels have to be quickly put into  place. The corporate bond market is perhaps the most important of these.  For several years, one committee after another has been making recommendations for  actions to develop this market. These cut across regulatory domains and this is perhaps  one reason why, despite the several steps taken, a critical threshold that would make  the market viable was not reached. However, in recent months this is on high priority  with both the regulators and the government addressing the remaining binding  constraints. The 2011-12 Union Budget took a crucial step in exempting bonds issued  by Infrastructure Development Funds from withholding tax. It would be reasonable to  extend this facility to bonds issued directly by infrastructure companies. Another issue  that has been flagged, inter-state differentials in stamp duties, is being addressed by  attempting a harmonization of rates across states. To make a large number of bonds  attractive to a potentially large domestic investor base in the form of insurance and  pension funds,  credit enhancement mechanisms which will allow bonds to meet  minimum rating requirements for a price are being explored. The more efficiently and  reliably this service is delivered, the larger will be the potential pool of investment for  these huge institutions.    Of course, aspirations notwithstanding, the question is whether bond markets can  realistically emerge as an alternative channel of financing, for infrastructure certainly,  but also for investment in other sectors. Chart 17 provides a cross-country comparison.  It would appear that even in the context of emerging economies, Indian bond markets  do have some headroom available.       10   VI. Concluding Remarks  I have addressed four sets of factors, which I believe hold the key to sustainable growth  and tried to articulate my thoughts on what the policy imperatives are. As I have pointed  out, in many areas, reform measures have been taken or are in the pipeline. However,  there are also many in which either action needs to be taken on the basis of credible  supporting evidence or, new approaches and solutions need to be visualized. I also  want to  re-emphasize my caveat that this was not meant to be an exhaustive list of  actions for sustainable growth.    I will not attempt to summarize my thoughts on actions and solutions for each set of  factors. But, I would like to end by emphasizing three key principles that have provided,  explicitly or implicitly, a common thread running through my presentation.   First, policies and strategies for growth have to be welfare-oriented. Placing the well- being or quality of life of the key stakeholders - individuals or households here- at the  centre of strategic thinking is the key to sustainability.   Second, any policy or strategy must give due consideration to the risks involved. High- risk-high-return may be a valid approach to portfolio management by individuals, but is  not so in a policy setting, where it is difficult to justify the large losses to some  stakeholders in terms of large gains to others. "The greatest good for the greatest  number" is certainly a valid premise for policymakers, but it needs to be complemented  with "the least risk for the greatest number". In situations in which heightened risks are  unavoidable for some stakeholders, reliable safety nets need to be an integral part of  the strategy.  Third, a pragmatic, "whatever works" approach is important. There are multiple  environments, multiple economic, social and political contexts in which policies are  made and implemented, even within a single country. No single solution can be  expected to work in all of them. Bottom-up thinking, which draws on local knowledge  and understanding to design appropriate solutions is necessary. At the same time, a  top-down element, which articulates common goals and policy principles, increases  efficiency in resource mobilization and allocation and facilitates learning across  jurisdictions, also plays a critical part. An optimal mix of the two needs to be found.   Let me end by once again thanking the MCCI for inviting me to speak on this special  occasion. I do hope that my presentation met your expectations.           11 Chart 1: Global Food Price Situation 430 300 International Food Prices (FAO)  Global Commodity Prices 380 250 330 200 280 150 230 100 180 50 130 0 80 Crude oil Meat Dairy Cereals Edible Oils Sugar  Metals Food 3 IMF Primary Commodity Price Index Source: IMF and the FAO Chart 2: Domestic Inflation Outlook Key Drivers of WPI Inflation 25 WPI Inflation (Y-o-Y) 12 20 10 15 8 10 6 5 4 0 2 -5 0 -10 -2 -15 Primary Food Articles Fuel and Power Group 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 Manufactured non-food Products 4 12  Index 2005=100 Per cent M1 2007 April M4 2007 May M7 2007 M10 2007 June M1 2008 July M4 2008 M7 2008 August M10 2008 September M1 2009 M4 2009 October M7 2009 November M10 2009 M1 2010 December M4 2010 January M7 2010 M10 2010 February M1 2011 March M4 2011 Y-o-Y, Per cent Index 2002-04=100 Apr-08 Jun-08 Apr-08 Aug-08 Jun-08 Oct-08 Aug-08 Dec-08 Oct-08 Dec-08 Feb-09 Feb-09 Apr-09 Apr-09 Jun-09 Jun-09 Aug-09 Aug-09 Oct-09 Oct-09 Dec-09 Dec-09 Feb-10 Feb-10 Apr-10 Apr-10 Jun-10 Jun-10 Aug-10 Aug-10 Oct-10 Oct-10 Dec-10 Dec-10 Feb-11 Feb-11 Apr-11 Apr-11Chart 3: Food Inflation: Nutrient  Differences 210 Trend in Primary Food Prices 190 170 150 130 110 90 Food Articles Excluding Protein Based items  Protein Based Food Food Articles Excluding Protein Based items (trend 2004-09) 5 Protein based food (trend 2004-09) Chart 4: Demographic Transitions 150 120 104 100 100 60 53 43 50 19 0 -50 -62 -100 Working Age Working Age Senior Citizen Senior Citizen  Population: Population: Population: Population:  2010-2020 2020-2030 2010-2020 2020-2030 India China 7 Source: World Bank 13  Increments in million WPI 2004-05=100 Apr-04 Aug-04 Dec-04 Apr-05 Aug-05 Dec-05 Apr-06 Aug-06 Dec-06 Apr-07 Aug-07 Dec-07 Apr-08 Aug-08 Dec-08 Apr-09 Aug-09 Dec-09 Apr-10 Aug-10 Dec-10 Apr-11Chart 5: Distribution of Working Age  Population (Share in total World Population Aged between 15-59 years) 50 Thailand 40 Philippines Pakistan 30 Malaysia Korea 20 Indonesia India 10 China Bangladesh 0 8 Source: UN Population Statistics Chart 6: Skill Levels SchoolEnrolment,secondary(%gross) 1975 1980 1990 2001 2007 Bangladesh 19 17 18 45 44 China ..51386374 India 2629414657 Indonesia 21 .. 48 58 76 Korea,Rep. 54 77 93 94 97 Malaysia 46 48 56 65 68 Pakistan 18 17 20 .. 32 Philippines 5465717581 Thailand 23 27 29 63 75 9 Source: World Bank 14  Per cent 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050Chart 7: Slow Employment Transition Transition in Employment (Usual  Transition in Growth Principal & Subsidiary Status) 100 100 90 90 21.2 24.8 25.4 80 80 50.6 14.3 70 60.8 70 62.6 18.2 18.7 60 60 50 50 40 19.4 40 64.5 30 30 20.2 57.0 55.9 20.6 20 20 30.0 10 10 19.0 16.8 0 0 1993-94 2004-05 2007-08 1993-94 2004-05 2007-08 Primary Secondary Agriculture Industry 10 Source: CSO and Economic Survey, Govt. of India.
