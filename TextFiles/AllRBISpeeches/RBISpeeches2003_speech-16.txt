         32ndAsian Clearing Union    Board Meetingnd32 ACU Board Meeting –Governor’s Welcome Address on June 16, 2003Honourable Governors and distinguished Delegates, Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:ndIt is a great privilege for me to welcome you to this 32 Board meeting of the Asian ClearingUnion (ACU). I am happy that this meeting is being held in the city of Bangalore, known as the‘City of Gardens’ , with a great tradition in music, literature, architecture, science and technology.The city is now known even more as India’s leading city for information technology.2.  Before proceeding further, I should mention with immense grief that Dr. Mohsen Nourbaksh,the Governor of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is no more with us. He was oneof the finest and leading personalities of the ACU fraternity. I request this House to stand insilence and  pay our humble respect to the memory of Dr. Nourbaksh.3.  The ACU Board meeting is being held in India after a gap of seven years – the previous onewas held in May 1996 at Mumbai. I am sure that this meeting, as was the case with all the earlieroccasions, will also prove to be a fruitful one and would be an important landmark in theconsolidation and further strengthening of the ACU.4.   The Asian Clearing Union (ACU), which started functioning in November 1975, has completed27 years of successful operations. It has proved to be a strong and purposeful regionalarrangement benefiting its members by optimizing the use of their foreign exchange resources.From a humble beginning of trade worth USD 51.4 million during the first year of its operations,the Union has grown into a reasonably powerful entity for regional co-operation in Asia.  Duringthe year 2002 it clocked a turnover of almost USD 7 billion.Benefits of ACU5.   We may recall that ACU was formed at a time when the countries in the region were facingacute shortage of foreign exchange and, therefore, had stringent exchange controls.  The Unionprovided the member countries with the twin advantages of economizing on the use of foreignexchange and also availing of short term credits during the period of the settlement cycle.  In theprocess, the governments of the member countries, their monetary authorities and central bankshave established close and purposeful relationships.  Further, the bankers and traders in themember countries benefited from lower transaction costs.  The ACU has established a creditablesettlement record in that there has been no default at all since the Union started functioning.6.  A significant contributory factor for the success of the ACU was the switching over of theunion’s accounting unit from AMU (Asian Monetary Unit) to the ACU dollar.  Under the current16th & 17th JUNE 2003 - BANGALORE, INDIA1         32ndAsian Clearing Union    Board Meetingsystem, in vogue since 1996, traders are being allowed not only to invoice their documents inUS dollars but also to make and receive payments in dollars.  Commercial banks in membercountries are allowed to open nostro accounts in ACU dollars to facilitate all receipts andpayments.  Further the central banks are arranging to fund as well as absorb excess liquidityfrom these accounts.7.   The switchover has facilitated the application of real time rates and up-gradation of the entireACU mechanism to be in tune with the rapid changes in the international forex markets due tothe revolutionary changes in satellite communications and wide ranging financial sectorliberalization in the developing economies.  As a result, the transactions are now being settledexpeditiously and in true reflection of the market value of the currencies of member countries.8.    Further, the switchover to ACU dollar for accounting of all the transactions of the Union hasfacilitated market participants in member countries to get forward cover for their transactions andalso made them eligible to get pre-shipment and post-shipment credit denominated in foreigncurrencies.9.  It is heartening to note that India has been playing a key role in the success of the ACUmechanism, topping the turnover table year after year.  Its share in the volume of transactionshas been around 40% followed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and Bangladesh at 23 per centand 17 per cent respectively on an average, during the last three years.10. In the last Board meeting my distinguished colleague from Sri Lanka, GovernorJayawardena rightly described ACU as the oldest institution for regional co-operation in Asia.Having been set up at a time of severe shortage of foreign exchange and having served themember countries well, the Union has reached a stage where there is a need to evaluate thefuture role of the ACU to adjust to new realities.  In this context, Governor Jayawardena hadsuggested that the terms of reference of the ACU needs to be revisited, and I am glad that atechnical team with the help of ESCAP has gone into this aspect.Future role of ACU11. For the evolution of ACU in the coming years the recommendations of the TechnicalCommittee, which examined `The Future role of ACU’ and related issues are important.  TheCommittee felt that the Union should continue in its present form and should continue to focuson the facility to settle, on a multilateral basis, payments for current international transactionsand thus economise on the use of foreign exchange reserves.  It has, however, highlighted thatthe ACU mechanism needs to demonstrate the tangible benefits it could provide to its members.16th & 17th JUNE 2003 - BANGALORE, INDIA2         32ndAsian Clearing Union    Board MeetingOn the expansion of ACU, the Committee has pointed out that neighbouring countries would jointhe mechanism only if they are convinced of the benefits they could derive from the membership.It is, therefore, necessary to make the ACU mechanism more efficient in the first instance andenhance the volume of trade routed through the arrangement.  In this context, the Committeehas noted that administrative bottlenecks have been hampering the progress of use of themechanism to some extent.  If ACU mechanism has to become popular, these bottlenecks haveto be removed.12.   Keeping the need of efficient telecommunication facilities among member countries in view,the Committee has also recommended that all the member countries could introduce SWIFTsystem for transmitting messages to facilitate faster settlement of transactions especially in viewof the fact that use of telex is being discontinued by most countries.  Introduction of the RealTime Gross Settlement System (RTGS), although expensive, could be thought of as a mediumterm objective by member countries.13.  Apart from improving upon the existing operational mechanism of ACU to enhanceefficiency of the Union it could now be used as a forum for free exchange of views among themembers.  The Union could become a strong and non-political forum of central banks in theregion to discuss issues relating to economic co-operation among member countries within theACU mechanism on the one hand, and other areas like exchange rate management and foreignexchange reserve management with a view to evolving appropriate approaches to resolvingtechnical issues on the other.  The forum could also facilitate exchange of experiences ondevelopments taking place in the respective economies, problems faced by individual membercountries etc.  The Board may like to deliberate on the details of the recommendations of theTechnical Committee when its Report is presented, later during the day.Other issues14. Besides the issues concerning the ACU mechanism which I have just mentioned, perhapsthis august gathering can deliberate on other issues like the overall economic development ofthe region.  The global economy is clouded by uncertainties.  The major economies of the worldare plagued by sluggish growth and are searching for ways to improve their performance.Compared to the industrialized nations, developing countries are faring better.  Within the ACU,most of the member countries recorded annual growths in excess of 4% during 2000-2001.  Thisaugurs well for the ACU.  However, there is need for better volumes of trade amongst themember countries so that the system of ACU could be utilized to the full extent for the maximumbenefit of each of them.16th & 17th JUNE 2003 - BANGALORE, INDIA3         32ndAsian Clearing Union    Board Meeting15.  There is need for further efforts at increasing economic co-operation among members andcloser relationships among the banking systems of the countries.  In the scenario of fastemerging developments, prompted by technology and deeper integration of global markets, it isimperative that ACU members should continuously update themselves technologically and bequick in adopting new and more efficient methods of operations.  As recommended by theTechnical Committee, members who are yet to switch over to SWIFT, should do soexpeditiously, in order to enable ACU to aim for and achieve `real time’ settlements as soon aspossible.16.  There is also a strong need to expand the membership.  Besides Maldives, the possibilitiesof bringing in Thailand, China, Malaysia and countries like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and othersshould be explored.  The expanded membership will help in better utilization of this importantmechanism for the benefit of all the members.17.  It is in this context that we have invited Thailand to attend this meeting.  I extend a warmwelcome to the representatives from the Bank of Thailand.  After this meeting, they will bevisiting our office in Mumbai to study in detail the working of the ACU mechanism and its utilityfor the member countries.  I earnestly hope that they will be convinced about the benefits ofmembership of the ACU.18.  Before I conclude, on your behalf and mine, I would like to pay a special tribute to thecontribution of Dr. Mohammad Firouzdor, Secretary General, to the work of ACU.  I have beeninformed that he proposes to retire from his position next week.  As you are aware he has beenthe guiding spirit behind the ACU Secretariat for the last six years.  Through his excellent efforts,among many other matters, Dr. Firouzdor has ensured that the switchover to ACU clearingmechanism is smooth and efficient. He was also instrumental in bringing the settlementmechanism to best international standards.  All of us are grateful to him for the valuablecontribution he has made to the success of ACU and wish him a healthy and happy retired life.19.  A successor to Dr. Firouzdor would also need to be elected at this meeting.  I propose wetake up this item under our last agenda on `any other business’.20.  We earnestly hope that your stay during this Board Meeting will be comfortable andenjoyable.  Once again, let me say how happy I personally, and the Reserve Bank are towelcome you to our country and to the City of Bangalore.Thank you,16th & 17th JUNE 2003 - BANGALORE, INDIA4
