Financial Stability : The Indian ExperienceSAARCFINANCE  Governors’ Symposium Shyamala Gopinath1FINANCIAL STABILITY AT THE CENTRE STAGEFinancial stabilityCame to the fore in the wake of the global crisisRecognition of a need to pursue financial stability as an explicit policy objectiveInternational policy initiatives to ensure financial stabilityG20, the Financial Stability Board, Basel Committee, IMF and other international institutionsIncreasing the resilience of financial institutions and infrastructure A macroprudential approach to regulation and supervision International cooperationInstitutional arrangements for financial stabilityCouncils for a collegial approach to preserving financial stabilityCentral banks being increasingly called upon to shoulder the 2greater burden of managing systemic risks FINANCIAL STABILITY IN INDIA: EARLY BEGINNINGSThough not an explicitly defined mandate for the Reserve Bank, pursuance of financial stability has been the critical policy driver.The broader macro-policy context overarches the policy frameworks for:Monetary managementInstitutional regulation – banks as well as non-banksExternal accountMarket development and regulation Financing of sovereign liabilities 3THE INDIAN APPROACH TO FINANCIAL STABILITYPrudential framework for banks is comprehensive and addresses Interconnectedness prudential limits on aggregate inter-bank liabilities for banks as a proportion of their net worth. The overnight un-collateralised funding market is restricted only to banks and primary dealers and there are ceilings for both lending as well as borrowingInvestment by banks in subordinated debt of other banks is assigned 100% risk weight for capital adequacy purpose. Banks’ aggregate investment in Tier II bonds issued by other banks and financial institutions is limited to 10 % of the investing bank's total capital.4Exposure of banks to any single NBFC is capped as a percentage of banks’ capital fundsTHE INDIAN APPROACH TO FINANCIAL STABILITYPrudential framework for banks addresses Excessive dollarisation of bank balance sheetsLimits on the proportion of wholesale foreign currency liabilities intermediated through the banking system.Retail foreign currency deposits from non-residents are subject to minimum maturity requirements and interest rate caps.Countercyclical approach to regulationVarying risk weights and provisioning norms – sectoral approachImposition of LTV ratiosIntroduced requirement of investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) of a minimum 5 % of the investment portfolio as a buffer for 5interest rate risk during a low interest rate regime.  THE INDIAN APPROACH TO FINANCIAL STABILITYCapital Account Management FrameworkSubstantially large freedom to equity flows – both FDI as well as portfolio flowsRegulatory framework for External Debt flows with a combination of administrative, quantitative and price based measures. Management of sovereign borrowingsBanks permitted to hold  stipulated 25 % investment in Government securities as ‘held to maturity’.Limited  dependence on foreign investors in respect of domestic currency debtStrong domestic investor base, apart from banks, in the form of 6insurance and pension/provident funds, which has enabled India to elongate the maturity of its domestic debt. THE INDIAN APPROACH TO FINANCIAL STABILITYNBFCs -Shadow bankingRegulatory perimeter extends to large NBFCs identified as systemically important engaged in credit intermediation.  Subject to capital adequacy and other prudential norms. SPVs exist but do not undertake significant liquidity and maturity transformation. Conservative securitisation guidelines.Hedge funds and private equity not within regulatory perimeter. Currently not highly leveraged. The issue of regulation of such entities being addressed.7MMFs - liquidity transformation issues need to be addressedTHE INDIAN APPROACH TO FINANCIAL STABILITYRegulation of financial marketsCalibrated approach to liberalisationExotic derivatives have not been allowedRegulatory framework for all OTC derivative markets, unlike mostadvanced countries Repo markets, which were at the heart of the crisis, are well regulated.Foreign participation in these markets is under a regulated framework   – part of capital account management Conservative prudential and accounting guidelines for banks –capital, liquidity, leverage8Shift towards CCPs much before the crisis THE INDIAN APPROACH TO FINANCIAL STABILITYMonitoring large financial conglomerates Consolidated regulationTwo-pronged structured process in the nature of off-site surveillance and the periodic interface with the conglomeratesArrangement for supervisory information sharing amongst the regulators to address specific issues in the monitoring of the identified conglomerate  Steps underway to tighten the capital adequacy norms for these conglomerates. 9PRE CRISIS INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTSA well defined regulatory framework for the Indian financial systemThe Reserve Bank regulates the banking sector and the NBFCs SEBI, IRDA and PFRDA are the other sectoral regulatorsA High Level Co-ordination Committee on Financial MarketsFor inter-regulatory coordinationCommittees of Reserve Bank’s Central Board – Board for Financial Supervision and Board for Payment and Settlement SystemsFocused regulation of financial institutions and infrastructure Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation10An effective safety net arrangement POST CRISIS INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTSFinancial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) and its Sub-Committee – a collegial approach to financial stabilityThe FSDC – headed by the Union Finance Minister -providing broad oversightThe Sub-Committee – headed by the Governor, Reserve Bank – the operating arm for financial stability in peace timesA multi-disciplinary department – the Financial Stability Unit  within the Reserve Bank Conducting ongoing macroprudential surveillance of the financial system11Bi-annual Financial Stability ReportsInitiatives to gauge stresses in the financial system BANKING STABILITY INDEX AND FINANCIAL STRESS INDICATORTo gauge build up of excesses/vulnerabilities in the banking sector and in financial markets Banking Stability Map Financial Stress Indicator 43210-1-212-3Apr-07Jul-07Oct-07Jan-08Apr-08Jul-08Oct-08Jan-09Apr-09Jul-09Oct-09Jan-10Apr-10Jul-10Oct-10Jan-11Apr-11Jul-11NETWORK ANALYSISAnalytical models which help identify, monitor and address systemic risksThe network of the Indian Contagion analysis of an Banking Sector idiosyncratic failure of an Indian bank 13BANKING STABILITY MEASURESA set of stability measures which take into account the distress dependence amongst banks  Joint probability of default and Banking Stability Index (probability of all banks in the system experiencing large losses simultaneously and the expected number of banks under distress when at least one bank is distressed)Toxicity and Vulnerability Index – the probability of a bank causing distress to another bank and of coming under distress if another bank in the system failsThe Toxicity Index The Vulnerability Index0.60.60.50.50.40.40.30.30.20.20.1 0.1140010/10/2007 10/10/2008 10/10/2009 10/10/201010/10/2007 10/10/2008 10/10/2009 10/10/2010MACRO-FINANCIAL STRESS TESTING A model based methodology to assess the impact of macroeconomic variables on the performance of the financial systemNon-performing advances under stress scenarios15INITIATIVES FOR MAINTAINING FINANCIAL STABILITYThe Indian approach to financial stability has stood the test of timeContagion impact of global crises were managed with relative equanimityPreventing crisis through ex ante actions has been our approach.Going forward, there are many challengesCrisis prevention - each crisis will be different. Anticipating and taking timely action essential. Growing complexities in the financial sector – domestically and internationally.16Addressing financial stability issues arising from operations ofIndian banks overseas  and globalisation of Indian corporates.EMERGING CHALLENGES Gaps in the availability of data and its integrityAbsence of Data in respect of risks concentrations, interconnections in the financial sector  New techniques and analytical methods a sine quo non for financial stability assessmentCommunication of risks to financial stabilityCoordination with all agenciesWith other functional arms within the Reserve BankWith other regulators  and with the government 17Developing skill sets SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE EMERGING CONTOURSThere is still no coherent framework emerging for regulation of financial markets from a stability perspective. In the area of reforming markets, the singular area of action has been to address counterparty risks and non-transparency in the OTC market by taking all such markets on to central clearing platforms. Entity regulation - higher capital charge for trading and securitization transactions. Role of banks and other entities in providing liquidity and leverage to financial market participants not addressed adequately 18In search of the holy grail of “level playing field” -counterproductive for financial stabilitySOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE EMERGING CONTOURS Continuing disconnect between the financial sector and the real sector?Post-crisis risk containment measures, in fact, pose the danger of perpetuating the dominance of trading activities in a bank – by making them uber-safe through CCPs, now considered a SIFI It is the traditional lending activities that may be forced to shoulder much of the burden of increased capital19SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE EMERGING CONTOURS An issue which will be of critical importance to the EMEs from a stability perspective is the nature of presence of foreign financial institutions - exposure of the domestic financial systems to the risk of proxy contamination with problems in global marketsEffectiveness and intensity of supervisory process - the decision making framework and space for the regulators given that dynamic judgement is necessary to deal  with system risk that is constantly changing. Rating agencies continue to rate SIFIs on the basis of 20implicit support from GovernmentSOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE EMERGING CONTOURS Macro-prudential regulation Macroprudential regulation is an inexact science and needs to be used in conjunction with other policies to be effective. Important to acknowledge what macroprudential regulation cannot do: It cannot manage economic cycles and  or target asset prices. It can only provide instruments to respond to these developments to cushion the financial system from stressesMistaking Articulation for Action (MAFA) phenomenon 21THANK YOU22
