Development of Bond Market in India
(Mohammad Tahir, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India)
Introduction
Bond markets link issuers, i.e., governments, state owned institutions, local bodies and
corporates having financing needs, with investors having investible surplus. An efficient bond
market is one where the requirements of both issuers and investors are met effectively at a price
(interest rates) determined competitively, and where price adjustment to new information is
seamless. For this purpose, the basic pre-requisites are: stable macro-economic environment,
absence or minimal presence of administered rates, a wide issuer and investor base (which
ensures adequate size and activity in the market), intermediaries, infrastructure for smooth and
safe trading and settlement of trades, and an enabling regulatory and legal environment.
Government bond markets play an important role insofar as they provide the benchmark
yield curve, on the basis of which most other debt instruments are priced. This paper presents the
development of the bond markets in India. I will also briefly deal with the corporate debt market.
An Overview of Debt Market in India
There are three main segments of debt market in India, viz., Government securities,
Public Sector Units (PSU) bonds and private sector corporate bonds.
India being a federal state, Government securities are issued by Central Government and
all the provincial Governments (India has 28 states), although in case of the latter such securities
constitute a relatively small portion of their fiscal deficits. In India, banks are required to
maintain statutorily a certain percentage of their liabilities in Government securities and other
specified liquid assets which creates a captive demand for Government securities. At present, the
Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) for banks is 25 per cent. Similar statutory requirements in
varying degrees are there for other type of financial institutions, viz., insurance companies,
provident funds, non-banking financial institutions etc.
The PSU bonds are generally treated as surrogates of sovereign paper, sometimes due to
explicit guarantee of Government, and often due to the comfort of public ownership.  Some of
the PSU bonds are tax free, a status not enjoyed even by Government securities.
Corporate bonds and debentures have maturities beyond 1 year and generally up to 10
years. Corporates also issue short-term commercial paper with maturity ranging from 15 days to
one year.
The matrix of issuers, investors, instruments in the debt market and their maturities are
presented in Table 1.

Size of Debt Market
In India, Government securities market is the overwhelming part of the overall debt
market, in terms of both outstanding securities, and trading volumes. The total outstanding debt
*
amounts to Rs.8,500 billion and forms 37% of GDP.  Of this, Central Government dated
securities as on March 31, 2002 amounted to Rs.5,363 billion (23 per cent of GDP) and that of
State governments to Rs.1,040 billion (4.5 per cent of GDP). According to informed estimates,
PSU Bonds/Private Corporate bonds amount to about Rs.2,000 billion (9 per cent of GDP). Thus,
nearly three-fourth of debt instruments is accounted for by Government.  Incidentally, the
#
present market capitalization of corporate equities is placed at Rs. 6,300 billion . Of the PSU/
Corporate debt estimated at Rs. 2,000 billion, about 30 per cent is listed on stock exchanges and
about 30 per cent held by banks. During 2001-02, the Central Government raised gross market
borrowings of Rs.1,142 billion (4.9 per cent of GDP) through marketable dated securities, while
State Governments raised Rs.187 billion.

The dominance of the Government securities in the secondary market is even more as it
accounts for more than 90% of the transactions. Average daily transaction volume in the
secondary market for government securities during 2001-02 is about Rs.40 billion whereas that
for corporate securities including PSUs is only about Rs. 2 to 4 billion. Among the government
securities, a very large bulk of volume is accounted for by Central government securities. The
turnover ratio (total transaction volume during the year as a multiple of outstanding stock) was
about 2.7 for the year 2001-02, as compared with 1.6 in 2000-01 and 0.8 in 1995-96 (Table 3).

*Transactions to Outstanding Volume
While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the issuance of government securities,
corporate debt securities fall under the regulatory purview of Securities and Exchange Board of
India (SEBI). Coordination with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is ensured both
at a policy level and at operational level. In particular, at a policy level, coordination is ensured
through a High Level Committee on Capital Markets presided by Governor, RBI, and consisting
of Chairman, SEBI, Chairman, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and
Finance Secretary, Government of India. The Deputy Governor of RBI is on the Board of
Directors of SEBI. Further, the Standing RBI – SEBI Technical Committee consisting of
officials from RBI and SEBI assists the HLCC at an operational level. Currently, amongst other
things, RBI and SEBI are working together to devise a regulating mechanism for the issuers of
private placements which will address issues of quality, transparency, end-use of funds and
listing of such bonds.
The trading of government securities on the Stock exchanges is currently through
negotiated dealing using members of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)/National Stock Exchange
(NSE) and these trades are required to be reported to the exchange. All the 23 stock exchanges in
the country provide facility for trading in corporate debt instruments. The bulk of the corporate
bonds, being privately placed, are, however, not listed on stock exchanges. Two Depositories,
National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited
(CDSL) maintain records of holding of securities in a dematerialised form. Records of holding of4
government securities for wholesale dealers like banks/PDs and other financial institutions are
1
maintained at the RBI .
Government Securities Market
Pre-Reform period Government Securities Market
In India, fiscal policy compulsions rendered internal debt management before 1991-92
passive. To keep government borrowing costs down, low coupon rates were offered on
government securities, which made real rates of return negative for several years till the mid-
1980s. During the 1980s, the volume of debt expanded considerably, particularly short-term
debt, due to automatic accommodation to Central government by the Central Bank (RBI),
through the mechanism of ad hoc Treasury Bills. With a captive investor base [through Statutory
Liquidity Ratio (SLR) prescription, mostly] and interest below the market rate, secondary market
for government bonds remained dormant. Artificial yields on government securities affected the
yield structure of financial assets in the system, and led to higher lending rates. Driven by these
compulsions, Reserve Bank’s monetary management was dominated by a regime of administered
interest rates, and rising Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and SLR prescriptions. High CRR and SLR
left little room for monetary maneuvering. It is against this backdrop, and in the context of the
overall economic reforms, that development of the government securities markets was initiated,
in the 1990s.
Post-Reforms Developments
The development of government securities market reflects a transition from passive to
active debt management by the RBI. The reforms undertaken by the Reserve Bank since 1990s
can be briefly viewed as a systematic exercise for the development of the debt market as well as
integration of the entire financial markets by making it deep, wide and transparent.
The reforms aimed at increasing the operational autonomy of the RBI by measures, such
as, abolition of automatic monetization through ad-hoc Treasury Bills (in 1997) and its
replacement by Ways and Means Advances facility, with limits, to meet temporary cash flow
mismatches for the Central Government. The elimination of automatic monetisation was
considered critical in the stabilization policy.
Secondly, government borrowing was made market based through the introduction of
auction system in primary issues.
Thirdly, improvements in institutional infrastructure were sought to be achieved through
the setting up of system of Primary Dealers.
Fourthly, the breadth and depth of markets were sought to be improved by introduction of
a variety of new instruments viz., Zero Coupon Bonds, Capital Indexed Bonds, Floating Rate
Bonds, Call and Put Option Bonds, etc.  However, plain vanilla bonds remain the mainstay.
Fifthly, since April 1999, the Reserve Bank has been actively pursuing the consolidation
of debt through reissuance/reopenings through price based auctions. This has greatly improved
the market liquidity and helped the emergence of benchmark securities.
                                                5
Sixthly, trading and settlement systems have been improved through introduction of
2
Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) system and operationalisation of Negotiated Dealing System
3
(NDS) and Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) .
 Finally, a retail market in government securities is sought to be promoted through a
system of non-competitive bidding at primary auctions.
Investor Base
Traditionally, the investor base for government securities in India has been banks,
financial institutions, PFs, insurance and pension funds- commercial banks (at present 63.5 per
cent) and LIC (18.3 per cent) being the largest holders (Table 4). Most of the holdings of these
investors are in the nature of statutorily mandated investments. This category has been further
diversified by the entry of co-operative banks, regional rural banks, mutual funds and non-
banking finance companies in recent periods. In addition, the entry of 100% Gilt Mutual Funds
has broadened the retail investor base. The thrust of policy initiatives in this direction is focused
on developing the retail segment of the market. Towards this end, several initiatives have been
taken.

In the primary market, to enable small and medium sized investors to participate in the
primary auction of Government securities, a Scheme of Non Competitive Bidding has been
introduced in January 2002. The Scheme is open to any person including firms, companies,
corporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity prescribed by RBI.
                                                6
The scheme provides for allocation of up to 5 per cent of the notified amount at the weighted
average rate of accepted bids. Investors can bid, through banks or PDs, a minimum of Rs.10,000
and maximum of Rs.10 million. To improve liquidity for retail investors in the secondary
market, RBI has been encouraging banks/PDs to offer two-way prices to retail investors. A few
PDs have already introduced Schemes for retail marketing of Government securities using the
network of bank branches/Post offices. Another measure to promote retailing currently under
consideration is a Scheme for screen based order-driven trading on the stock exchanges.
Instruments
Prior to the 1990s, most of the government bond issuance was in the form of plain
vanilla, fixed coupon securities. For a market to meet the diverse funding and hedging needs of
its participants, a wide array of instruments needs to be available. Through the 1990s, various
types of instruments have been introduced, like zero coupon bonds, capital indexed bonds,
floating rate bonds and bonds with call and put option. But, plain vanilla bonds remain the
mainstay. The introduction of STRIPs is being envisaged. These instruments would serve the
need of asset-liability management of participants.
Market Intermediaries
The system of Primary Dealers was introduced in 1996. The PDs underwrite as well as
bid in auctions of primary issuances of government securities.  They are also expected to provide
two-way quotes in the secondary market, and thereby help develop the retail market. The
Reserve Bank extends concessional finance to PDs. There are currently 18 PDs in operation. Of
these, 9 are promoted by public sector banks and public financial institutions, 5 by foreign banks
and 2 with the collaboration of foreign security houses and 2 by local non-banking finance
companies (NBFCs). RBI has prescribed guidelines to improve the risk management system of
PDs. The capital adequacy requirements of PDs take into account both credit risk and market
risk. They are required to maintain a minimum capital of 15 per cent of aggregate risk weighted
assets, including market risk capital (arrived at using the Value at Risk method). ALM discipline
has been extended to PDs. Offsite surveillance of PDs is done on the basis of daily, monthly and
quarterly returns. RBI is also vested with the responsibility of on-site inspection of primary
dealers. A satellite dealer system was introduced in 1996 to act as a second tier to the Primary
Dealers in developing the market. The system, which was in operation for more than six years,
was discontinued effective May 2002, as it did not yield the desired results.
Measures to Deepen the Government Securities Markets
To cater to the differing requirements of investors, Reserve Bank has been issuing
Government securities of varying tenors ranging up to 30 years. For most part of the 1990s, the
maturity of Central government issuance ranged up to 10 years. This has led to redemption
pressure and refinancing risk. This factor, as also the need to develop the yield curve for longer
tenors, has necessitated elongation of maturity of government bond issuance. Thus, the weighted
average maturity of bonds issued during a year, which was around 5.5 years in 1996-97,
increased to 14.3 years in 2001-02. As a debt manager, Reserve Bank has the obligation of
minimizing the cost of borrowing to the Government. Normally, with an upward sloping yield
curve, longer the maturity of the security, higher is the cost; thus there is a trade-off between
tenor of borrowing and its cost.  However, the falling interest rate scenario in the last two years,
has helped Reserve Bank to achieve the twin objectives of elongating the maturity profile of new7
debt, and reducing the cost of borrowing at the same time. The average cost of issuance of dated
securities issued during 2001-02 has come down substantially to 9.44 per cent from 10.95 per
cent in 2000-01 and 11.77 per cent in 1999-2000. The weighted average yield and weighted
average maturity of the GOI dated securities issued during the current year so far works out to
7.53 per cent and 13.3 years, respectively (Table 5).

With a view to improving fungibility amongst the securities and facilitate consolidation
of debt, a policy of passive consolidation through reissuance/ reopenings was started in 1999.
The larger stock size of securities in question has greatly improved market liquidity, and helped
the emergence of benchmark securities in the market. Active consolidation - by merging debts -
has not been resorted to so far, in view of administrative costs and legal considerations. The
process of passive consolidation itself has helped in more or less containing the number of bonds
to a level that was prevailing at the end of 1998-99. Of the 25 loans issued (excluding private
placements) during 2001-02, 12 were new loans and the remaining were reissues of existing
loans. This ability to 'reissue' or 'reopen' loans is limited by the maximum outstanding amount
that is perceived as 'manageable' from the viewpoint of redemption in the year of maturity.
However, the drop in yields and resultant steep premia, in many cases, deters 'buy and hold'
investors from subscribing to existing securities. As at the end of March 2002, there are 111
Central Government securities with outstanding amount of Rs.5363 billion.  Of these, 23
securities with minimum outstanding issues of Rs.100 billion or more account for 50 per cent of
the total outstanding amount. The maturity profile of Government of India market loans is
presented in Table 6.

An additional source of demand for government securities has evolved with the
introduction of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), fully collateralised against government
securities. Repo and Reverse Repo operations between RBI and banks under LAF, have
developed into the primary mechanism of managing short-term liquidity in the system (Repo for
1 day and 14 days, reverse repo for 1 day). The system is also used for maintaining orderly
conditions in money market.
In respect of T-Bills, a pre-announced issuance calendar for auctions is being provided
since 1998-99.  Further, in an effort to provide further transparency and stability in the
Government securities market as well as to enable institutional and retail investors to plan their
investments in a better manner, Reserve Bank has started the practice of announcing a half-
yearly calendars for issuance of Government of India dated securities in the current fiscal year
2002-03.
Developments in Market Infrastructure
Securities Settlement System: Settlement of government securities and funds is being done on a
gross trade-by-trade Delivery vs. Payments (DvP) basis in the books of Reserve Bank, since
1995. A Special Funds Facility from Reserve Bank for securities settlement has also been in
operation since October 2000 for breaking gridlock situations arising in the course of DvP
settlement.
With the introduction of Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) in February 2002,
which acts as clearing house and a central counterparty, the problem of gridlock of settlements
has been reduced. To enable Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL) account holders to
avail of the benefits of dematerialised holding through their bankers, detailed guidelines have
been issued to ensure that entities providing custodial services for their constituents employ
appropriate accounting practices and safekeeping procedures.
Negotiated Dealing System : A Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) (Phase I) has been
operationalised effective from February 15, 2002.  In Phase I, the NDS provides on line
electronic bidding facility in primary auctions, daily LAF auctions, screen based electronic
dealing and reporting of transactions in money market instruments, facilitates secondary market
transactions in Government securities and dissemination of information on trades with minimal
time lag.  In addition, the NDS enables “paperless” settlement of transactions in government
securities with electronic connectivity to CCIL and the DvP settlement system at the Public Debt
Office through electronic SGL transfer form.9
Clearing Corporation of India Limited : The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL)
commenced its operations in clearing and settlement of transactions in Government securities
(including repos) with effect from February 15, 2002.  Acting as a central counterparty through
novation, the CCIL provides guaranteed settlement and has in place risk management systems to
limit settlement risk and operates a settlement guarantee fund backed by lines of credit from
commercial banks. All repo transactions have to be necessarily put through the CCIL, while all
outright transactions up to Rs.200 million have to be settled through CCIL ( Transactions
involving larger amounts are settled directly in RBI).
Transparency and Data Dissemination
To enable both institutional and retail investors to plan their investments better and also
to providing further transparency and stability in the Government securities market, an indicative
calendar for issuance of dated securities has been introduced in 2002. To improve the
information flow to the market Reserve Bank announces auction results on the day of auction
itself and all transactions settled through SGL accounts are released on the same day by way of
press releases/on RBI website. Statistical information relating to both primary and secondary
market for Government securities is disseminated at regular interval to ensure transparency of
debt management operations as well as of secondary market activity. This is done through either
press releases or Bank’s publications viz., (e.g., RBI monthly Bulletin, Weekly Statistical
Supplement, Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, Report on Currency and Finance and
Annual Report).
The Reserve Bank is the initial signatory of Special Data Dissemination Standards of
IMF and places substantial information and statistics on its website. The data on trades
negotiated/reported on NDS will also be available shortly on RBI’s website.
Corporate Bond Markets
The Reserve Bank’s role in the development of corporate bond markets is indirect and is
governed by its interest in monetary policy transmission and in the stability and efficiency of the
financial sector as a whole. Besides, banks, whose financial health is the responsibility of the
central bank, have a large exposure to the corporate bond market with more than 80 per cent of
such investments being in privately placed corporate securities. Activity in the secondary market
is thus rather thin.  As the non-transparent practices in this market is a matter of concern,
Reserve Bank issued guidelines in June 2001 specifying the due diligence to be undertaken,
disclosures to be obtained and credit appraisal to be made by investing banks. Subsequently a
Working Group set up by RBI (February 2002) went into the detailed disclosure norms and data
collection measures on private placements.  Currently, RBI and SEBI are working together to
devise a regulating mechanism for the issuers of private placements which will address issues of
quality, transparency, end-use of funds and listing of such bonds.
There is no comprehensive database source for outstanding stock of corporate debt
issuance in India. An analysis of the flow data (issuances) in recent period indicates dominance
of private placement (Table 7).

The trends in the issuance pattern of privately placed debt during the last three years is presented
in Table 8, which reveals the following trend-
i) The share of the private sector in total private placement market has been growing vis-
à-vis the public sector.
ii) The share of financial entities, both public and private has come down partly because of
the limit imposed on raising of Tier 2 capital by banks.
iii) Of late, there appears to be an increase in private placements by the private non-
financial sector.

A very large proportion of the debt being issued of late is being rated. In the year 2000-
01, 80% of the debt (in volume terms) was rated, while the proportion of rated debt rose to 91%
during 2001-02 (April-September). From the rating distribution, it emerges that more than half of
the total issuance (52 to 53%) in this period is rated AAA, while another 15% is having a rating
of AA+ in 2001-02 as against 2% in 2000-01, a pointer perhaps that a growing number of
investors are beginning to factor the rating rationale as a key input into their investment
decisions. Currently, about 75 per cent of privately placed corporate issuance is AA rated or
better.11
Until 1992, interest rate on corporate bond issuances was regulated and was uniform
across credit categories. In the initial years, corporate bonds were issued with "sweeteners" in the
form of debt-equity convertibility clause, or equity warrants. Most corporate bonds were plain
coupon paying bonds, though a few variations in the form of zero coupon securities, deep
discount bonds and secured promissory notes were issued. After the deregulation of interest rates
on corporate bonds in 1992, a variety of instruments in the corporate bond markets have been
introduced, including bond strips, floating rate instruments with floors and caps. In recent years,
there has been an increase in issuance of corporate bonds with embedded put and call option.
Other aspects for development of corporate bond markets which are under consideration
are- availability of information and transparency of the market, increased securitization and
increased dematerialisation in corporate bonds and consideration of Repo for corporate bonds
Institutional Issues
Role of Self-Regulatory Organisations
In the context of Indian debt market, self-regulatory bodies like the Fixed Income Money
Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) and the Primary Dealers Association of
India (PDAI) have been encouraged in the recent past, as part of reform process to give an
impetus to the development of the bond and money markets in India. These bodies have served
as crucial layers between the regulator and market and have contributed to developing new
benchmarks and products besides providing training and development support to participants.
They have formulated guidelines for dispute resolution mechanisms and are also involved in the
process of developing standard practices and codes of conduct.  Both PDAI and FIMMDA are
represented in the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of the Reserve Bank of India meant for
deliberating and advising RBI, on issues pertaining to Government Securities and Money
Markets. TAC is constituted by Reserve Bank and includes, apart from RBI officials, important
market participants, academicians and policy makers.  FIMMDA is involved in the task of
valuation of all Central Government Securities. The daily FIMMDA yield curve of Central
Government bonds is fast emerging as an accepted benchmark to price securities. In addition to
this, FIMMDA has also been contributing to developing guidelines for documentation of repo,
securitised debt and several other debt market instruments.
Banks and Bond Markets
In India, the banking system which incidentally has been dominated by the public sector,
played a pioneering role in initiating growth of mutual funds, merchant banking and other
financial services.  Structurally, banks have been permitted to operate through subsidiaries as
asset management companies, PDs, merchant banks and mutual funds.  The Development
Financial Institutions also played a role but they dominated in promoting credit rating agencies,
sponsoring national stock exchanges, depositories, etc.  In regard to Government Securities
segment of the market, which accounts for about 75 per cent of the stock, about 60 per cent of
the stock is held by the banking system.  As regards the corporate debt segment, both private
placement and public issue, over half of the issuance is by banks and financial institutions.
Role of Credit Rating Agencies12
+
In India, there are four Credit Rating Agencies ( CRAs) and each of them has
collaboration with internationally renowned CRAs to supplement the local knowledge and skills.
The RBI prescribes a number of regulatory uses of ratings.  Of those related to the money and
debt markets, a corporate must get an issue of Commercial Paper rated and may issue such paper
subject to a minimum rating.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which is the
regulator of CRAs has stipulated that ratings are compulsory on all public issues of debentures
with maturity exceeding 18 months.  Pension funds can only invest in debt securities that have
high ratings, as per the stipulations of Government.
Tax Regime and Debt Markets
The removal of tax deduction at source (TDS) on Government Securities resulted in
ending the practice of voucher trading in the Government Securities market and thus removing
pricing distortions in the market.  The amendments to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 have
exempted debt instruments dealt in demat form from the applicability of stamp duty
(Government Securities as such are exempted from the stamp duty).  This encouraged demat
holding/transactions in debt instruments, as also trading in debt instruments.
The recent amendments to Section 47 of the IT Act, facilitating securities lending and
borrowing operations will ensure safe and smooth settlement through the recently established
CCIL.
The recent notification issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Government of
India in bringing about rationalisation in the tax treatment for the deep discount bonds (where
marked-to-market gains are to be reckoned for tax purpose), apart from removing the distortions
will keep the market in readiness for the development of STRIPS in Government Securities and
facilitate a zero coupon yield curve.
For the financial system as a whole, the Expert Committee to Review the System of
4
Administered Interest Rates (2002) and other related Committees have made certain
recommendations on the tax regime, which if implemented would remove some distortions and
ensure a level playing field among participants and instruments in the financial markets.  These
measures coupled with the decision to align the administered interest rates with market rates of
interest should pave the way for significant improvement in the environment for debt markets.
Road Ahead for Indian Debt Markets
Debt management in India has clearly come a long way from a passive system to a
market driven exercise with developed institutions, instruments and markets.
In terms of international benchmarks, India ranks on par with some of the developed
countries in areas like institutional framework, risk management set-up, market development,
clearing and settlement procedures and transparency in debt management operations

The artificially administered interest rate system of government securities market has
transformed into a market determined one, and an inactive thin secondary market has grown into
an actively traded and reasonably liquid market.
Settlement systems have already developed significantly. RBI is also working towards
the development of a system for Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), which is expected to be
operational in about a years' time.
Some of the major issues relating to Government debt need to be highlighted:
Firstly, separation of Government debt management from RBI has been, in principle,
considered desirable. However, this would be dependent on the fulfilment of three pre-
conditions, viz., development of financial markets, reasonable control over fiscal deficit and
necessary legislative changes. The feasibility and further steps for separation of government debt
management from Reserve Bank is proposed to be taken up once Fiscal Responsibility Bill
(which is pending before Parliament) is enacted.
Secondly, measures to widen the base of the repo market including extending it to CSGL
account holders, introduction of longer term repo, rollover of repos, taxation and standardised
accounting are the major areas to be focussed in the near future.
Thirdly, the feasibility of a "When Issued" market for Government securities, which
would help efficient price discovery in the primary auctions, is being examined.
Fourthly, operational modalities are being finalised for the introduction of STRIPS.
Fifthly, order driven screen based anonymous trading in government securities on the
stock exchanges is under consideration.
Sixthly, dematerialised holding of all bonds, corporate as well as government bonds, is
sought to be achieved.
Finally, the implementation of the next phase of the PDO-NDS project involving
integration with security settlement system and primary markets operations, automation and
inter-connectivity of PDOs, electronic maintenance of record of ownership, etc. is under way.
