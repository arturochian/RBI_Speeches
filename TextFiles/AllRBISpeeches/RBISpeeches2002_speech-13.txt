Co-Operative Banks in India :Strengthening through Corporate GovernancebyVepa KamesamDeputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India 1I deem it a privilege to have been invited to address this gathering on a topic of tremendousrelevance, focus and significance in today’s context. Needless to say, for the co-operativebanks in India these are transitional times. Never before has the need for restoring customerconfidence in the co-operative sector been felt so much. Never before has the issue of goodgovernance in the co-operative banks assumed such criticality. The literature on corporategovernance in its wider connotation covers a range of issues such as protection ofshareholders’ rights, enhancing shareholders’ value, Board issues including its compositionand role, disclosure requirements, integrity of accounting practices, the control systems, inparticular internal control systems. Corporate governance especially in the co-operativesector has come into sharp focus because more and more co-operative banks in India, both inurban and rural areas, have experienced grave problems in recent times which has in a waythreatened the profile and identity of the entire co-operative system. These problems includemismanagement, financial impropriety, poor investment decisions and the growing distancebetween members and their co-operative society.2. The purpose and objectives of co-operatives provide the framework for co-operativecorporate governance. Co-operatives are organized groups of people and jointly managed anddemocratically controlled enterprises. They exist to serve their members and depositors andproduce benefits for them. Co-operative corporate governance is therefore about ensuring co-operative relevance and performance by connecting members, management and theemployees to the policy, strategy and decision-making processes.3. In fact, the very definition of corporate governance stems from its organic link withthe entire gamut of activities having direct or indirect influence on the financial health ofcorporate entities. For the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, who was one ofthe first to attempt a definition, corporate governance is to conduct business in accordancewith owner or shareholders’ desires which generally will be to make as much money aspossible while conforming to the basic rules of the society embodied in law and localcustoms. In subsequent definitions, the scope of corporate governance has got expanded.While some experts say corporate governance means doing everything better, to improverelations between companies and their shareholders, to encourage people to think long-term,to ensure that information needs of all shareholders are met and to ensure that executivemanagement is monitored properly in the interest of shareholders, the Former President ofWorld Bank, Mr. James Wolfensohn had said that corporate governance is about promotingcorporate fairness, transparency and accountability. A more comprehensive definition hascome from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation & Development <OECD> whichidentifies corporate governance as the system by which business corporations are directedand controlled. Here the corporate governance structure specifies the distribution of rightsand responsibilities among different participants in the corporation, such as the Board,managers, shareholders and other stakeholders and spells out the rules and procedures formaking decisions on corporate affairs. By doing this, not only does it provide the structurethrough which the company objectives are set, it also provides the means of attaining theseobjectives and monitoring performance.         24. It will certainly not be out of place here to recount how issues relating to corporategovernance and corporate control have come to the fore the world over in the recent past. Theseeds of modern corporate governance were probably sown by the Watergate scandal in theUSA. Subsequent investigations by US regulatory and legislative bodies highlighted controlfailures that had allowed several major corporations to make illegal political contributionsand bribe government officials. While these developments in the US stimulated debate in theUK, a spate of scandals and collapses in that country in the late 1980s and early 1990s ledshareholders and banks to worry about their investments. Several companies in UK whichsaw explosive growth in earnings in the ’80s ended the decade in a memorably disastrousmanner. Importantly, such spectacular corporate failures arose primarily out of poorlymanaged business practices.5. This debate was driven partly by the subsequent enquiries into corporate governance(most notably the Cadbury Report) and partly by extensive changes in corporate structure. InMay 1991, the London Stock Exchange set up a Committee under the chairmanship of SirArian Cadbury to help raise the standards of corporate governance and the level ofconfidence in financial reporting and auditing by setting out clearly what it sees as therespective responsibilities of those involved and what it believes is expected of them. TheCommittee investigated accountability of the Board of Directors to shareholders and to thesociety. It submitted its report and associated ‘code of best practices’ in December 1992wherein it spelt out the methods of governance needed to achieve a balance between theessential powers of the Board of Directors and their proper accountability. Being a pioneeringreport on corporate governance, it would perhaps be in order to make a brief reference to itsrecommendations which are in the nature of guidelines relating to, among other things, theBoard of Directors and Reporting & Control.6. The Cadbury Report stipulated that the Board of Directors should meet regularly,retain full and effective control over the company and monitor the executive management.There should be a clearly accepted division of responsibilities at the head of the companywhich will ensure balance of power and authority so that no individual has unfettered powersof decision. The Board should have a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it fordecisions to ensure that the direction and control of the company is firmly in its hands. Thereshould also be an agreed procedure for Directors in the furtherance of their duties to takeindependent professional advice.7. On Reporting & Control, the Cadbury Report recommended that the Board shouldensure that an objective and professional relationship is maintained with the auditors. It is theBoard’s duty to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s position,the report said. The Board should establish an Audit Committee with written terms ofreference which deal clearly with its authority and duties. The Directors should explain theirresponsibility for preparing the accounts next to a statement by the auditors about theirreporting responsibilities. The Directors should also report on the effectiveness of thecompany’s system of internal control. The report also stipulated that the Directors shouldreport that the business is a going concern with supporting assumptions or qualifications asnecessary.8. The Cadbury Report generated a lot of interest in India. The issue of corporategovernance was studied in depth and dealt with by the Confederation of Indian Industries(CII), Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ASSOCHAM) and Securities andExchange Board of India (SEBI). These studies reinforced the Cadbury Report’s focus on thecrucial role of the Board and the need for it to observe a Code of Best Practices. Co-operativebanks as corporate entities possess certain unique characteristics. Paradoxical as it may3sound, evolution of co-operatives in India as peoples’ organizations rather than businessenterprises adopting professional managerial systems has hindered growth of professionalismin co-operatives and proved to be a neglected area in their evolution.9. Professionalism reflects the co-existence of high level of skills and standards inperforming duties entrusted to an individual. The absence of a proper system of placementand skill upgradation inputs constrain professional management in co-operative banks.Though there is a system of training in place in many co-operative banks, attempts areseldom made to match them with the current and future staff requirements. It is desirable thatthe training programmes encompass skill upgradation and aptitude development in fullmeasure. It is also necessary to keep the staff sufficiently motivated through periodic jobrotation, job enrichment and recognition of performance. The co-operative banks shouldindeed work like professional organizations on sound managerial systems in tune with theneeds of the time taking care of future projections of requirements to retain and improve theirmarket share and identity in the long run. It is in this context that professionalism andaccountability of the banks’ boards assume such critical significance.10. Regulators are external pressure points for good corporate governance. Merecompliance with regulatory requirements is not however an ideal situation in itself. In fact,mere compliance with regulatory pressures is a minimum requirement of good corporategovernance and what are required are internal pressures, peer pressures and market pressuresto reach higher than minimum standards prescribed by regulatory agencies. RBI’s approachto regulation in recent times has some features that would enhance the need for andusefulness of good corporate governance in the co-operative sector. The transparency aspecthas been emphasized by expanding the coverage of information and timeliness of suchinformation and analytical content. Importantly, deregulation and operational freedom mustgo hand in hand with operational transparency. In fact, the RBI Governor’s April 2002Monetary & Credit Policy announcements have made it clear that with the abolition ofminimum lending rates for co-operative banks, it will be incumbent on these banks to makethe interest rates charged by them transparent and known to all customers. Banks havetherefore been asked to publish the minimum and maximum interest rates charged by themand display this information in every branch. Disclosure and transparency are thus key pillarsof a corporate governance framework because they provide all the stakeholders with theinformation necessary to judge whether their interests are being taken care of. We in RBI seetransparency and disclosure as an important adjunct to the supervisory process as theyfacilitate market discipline of banks.11. Another area which requires focused attention is greater transparency in the balancesheets of co-operative banks. The commercial banks in India are now required to discloseaccounting ratios relating to operating profit, return on assets, business per employee, NPAs,etc. as also maturity profile of loans, advances, investments, borrowings and deposits. Theissue before us now is how to adapt similar disclosures suitably to be captured in the auditreports of co-operative banks. RBI had advised Registrars of Co-operative Societies of theState Governments in 1996 that the balance sheet and profit & loss account should beprepared based on prudential norms introduced as a sequel to Financial Sector Reforms andthat the statutory/departmental auditors of co-operative banks should look into thecompliance with these norms. Auditors are therefore expected to be well-versed with allaspects of the new guidelines issued by RBI and ensure that the profit & loss account andbalance sheet of co-operative banks are prepared in a transparent manner and reflect the truestate of affairs. Auditors should also ensure that other necessary statutory provisions and4appropriations out of profits are made as required in terms of Co-operative Societies Act /Rules of the state concerned and the bye-laws of the respective institutions.12. Appropriate internal control systems become even more critical in the context of thegrowing emphasis on diversification of business products as the prime need at all levels inco-operative credit institutions.  It is indeed necessary for co-operative banks to devoteadequate attention to maximizing their returns on every unit of resources through an effectivefunds management strategy and mechanism. One prime component of the investmentportfolio of the co-operative banks which has attracted a lot of attention - unfortunately for allthe wrong reasons - is their transaction in government securities. So much so that it has eventriggered the holding of today’s Convention.13. The financial sector reforms in India have sought to achieve, among other things,improvement in the financial health and competitive capabilities by means of prescription ofprudential norms. The co-operative banks have also thus been put under the prudential normsregime to bring about the desirable level of transparency in their balance sheets. While urbanco-operative banks have been subjected to income recognition, asset classification,provisioning and other related norms in a phased manner beginning April 1992, theseprudential norms including asset classification and provisioning (excluding the capitaladequacy ratio) were made applicable to the SCBs and DCCBs from the year 1996-97 andextended to ARDBs from 1997-98.14. RBI had also issued comprehensive guidelines transactions in securities to all co-operative banks - both urban and rural - as early as in September 1992. Detailed guidelineshave been given therein on transactions through brokers, Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL)facility, issue of Bank Receipts, internal control systems, audit and review systems, etc. Asper the guidelines in force, each bank is required to formulate an investment policy, with theapproval of its Board. Banks have been advised that all transactions in Government Securitiesfor which SGL facility is available should be put through SGL accounts only. Certaindiscipline has also been introduced for transactions through SGL accounts for minimizingsettlement risks through a framework for penal action against bouncing of SGL transferforms for want of sufficient balance in the SGL account or current account.15. Banks were advised that only brokers registered with NSE or BSE or OTCEI shouldbe utilized for acting as intermediary. If the deal is put through a broker, the role of the brokershould be restricted to that of bringing the two parties to the transaction together. Thesettlement of the transaction, namely, both funds settlement and security settlement should bemade directly between the counter parties. With a view to ensuring that a disproportionatevolume of transactions is not routed through one or a few broker, a prudential ceiling of 5%of the total transactions (both purchases and sales) has been prescribed for routingtransactions through an individual broker. In case any bank is required to exceed theprudential ceiling of 5% for any broker, the bank is required to inform the Board indicatingthe reasons therefor post-facto.  Banks have also been advised to have proper internal controlmeasures for monitoring the transactions in government securities.16. Regulatory policy can however only set the broad contours of an appropriateinvestment strategy. It is no guarantee for articulation and implementation of commerciallysound investment decisions by lending institution(s). Even the most comprehensiveregulatory framework and effective supervisory system need not be a foolproof mechanismagainst a pliant management acting in collusion with unscrupulous clients. Supervision isonly periodic and therefore it cannot be a substitute for effective and continuous internalcontrol backed by an independent and efficacious audit system. Towards this, it is imperativeto have in place Audit Committees of the Board independent of the management in co-5operative banks. It may well be recalled that with the extension of the Banking RegulationsAct to the urban co-operative banks in 1966 and deposit insurance in 1971, people’sconfidence in the co-operative sector had taken a big leap forward. So much so that today thenon-member deposits in urban banks far exceed member deposits. Nothing would be moretragic if we fritter away these advantages and allow indiscipline and lack of commitment inthese banks make people’s trust in the co-operative sector a casualty.17. One important issue that has engaged much attention in the recent past is the dualityof control over co-operative banks. In terms of the Co-operative Societies Acts of respectiveStates, the Registrar of Co-operative Societies was the sole regulator and supervisor of all thesocieties registered in his State including societies carrying on banking business. With theapplication of BR Act, 1949 (AACS) to co-operative banks, this position has since changed.While RBI now regulates and supervises banking activities carried on by urban co-operativesocieties, supervision of State Co-operative Banks and District Central Co-operative Banks iscarried out by NABARD.  The core principles of supervision in relation to co-operativebanks have thus to be formulated and implemented by RBI in respect of UCBs and byNABARD in respect of SCBs & DCCBs and there is an emergent need to constantly beef upthe supervisory system through proper on-site monitoring and adequate off-site surveillance.We also need to analyse and pick up early warning signals, if any, in respect of any suchirregularities in the investment portfolio of these banks from the periodic review reports onsuch transactions which are received from them. There is also an urgent need for clarity indefining the roles of various control institutions by streamlining processes, procedures, etc.for removing overlapping of controls over cooperative banks presently vested with StateGovts., RBI and NABARD, as the may be. It is in this context that the Governor’s Monetary& Credit Policy announcement in April 2001 had stressed the need for a separate regulatoryagency for the co-operative banks. This issue is being debated in various quarters.18. Credit institutions are linked to each other through a complex chain of inter-bankrelationships which - as recent instances have showed - in any event of difficulty becomemechanisms for spread of the contagion effect. Signs of financial mismanagement in aninstitution or a group of institutions regardless of the reasons is liable to set off similarproblems in other institutions and open serious risks in the financial system. It is in thiscontext that good corporate governance assumes critical importance. Power and decision-making in co-operative banks are all too often concentrated at the top in too few hands. Co-operative performance has therefore been for a long time characterized by lack ofparticipation and sense of involvement. Active members who feel that they are part of anorganization that has goals in harmony with their own and clear roles for constructivelyengaged, competent governing bodies and management would be a powerful force to buildco-operative identity and excellence. It is perhaps time that the State Governmentsrefashioned management in co-operative banks by picking up threads of good corporategovernance.19. Success of economic decisions depends after all on the human resources at thedisposal of any organization. A change is needed today in the co-operative banks which isbuilt on confidence in human capital - the most important of all resources - in commitment,creativity and innovation brought about by proactive management, membership andemployees. Strong corporate governance that takes its obligations seriously can truly be asource of strength to the management. The ability to capture knowledge and wisdom givesco-operative banks their competitive advantage. A prerequisite is that participants from allparts of a co-operative organization know and understand its purpose, core values andvisions.620. In the years to come, the Indian financial system will grow not only in size but also incomplexity as the forces of competition gain further momentum and financial marketsacquire greater depth. I can assure you that the policy environment will remain supportive ofhealthy growth and development with accent on more operational flexibility as well asgreater prudential regulation and supervision. The real success of our financial sector reformswill however depend primarily on the organizational effectiveness of the banks, including co-operative banks, for which initiatives will have to come from the banks themselves. It is forthe co-operative banks themselves to build on the synergy inherent in the co-operativestructure and stand up for their unique qualities. With elements of good corporategovernance, sound investment policy, appropriate internal control systems, better credit riskmanagement, focus on newly-emerging business areas like micro finance, commitment tobetter customer service, adequate mechanisation and proactive policies on house-keepingissues, co-operative banks will definitely be able to grapple with these challenges and convertthem into opportunities. I am sure all of you will bring your experience and knowledge tobear upon the afore-discussed issues in course of the deliberations in the next two days.1 Inaugural Address delivered on July 5, 2002 by Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of Indiaat the National Convention of Urban Co-operative Banks : Strengthening through Corporate Governance atMumbai, organized by Academy of Corporate Governance, Hyderabad supported by Administrative StaffCollege of India, Hyderbad.
