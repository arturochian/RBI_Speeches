1 Banking Transactions in the Next Decade: Faster, Cheaper and Easier Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.  It is a pleasure and privilege to be here today at this ninth Annual Conference on  Global Banking: Paradigm shift jointly organised by Federation of Indian Chambers  of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Indian Banks Association (IBA). The theme  of this years Conference is Banking 2020: Making the Decades Promise Come  True. Let me begin by asking to whom are we making this promise.  We are making  this promise to the customers, especially the small and retail customers. Let me  explain in brief the importance and relevance of this promise. We stand today at a  point of inflexion as far banking is concerned both globally as well as in India.  Globally, the financial crisis has offered us a number of insights into the ways in  which the existing banking system needs to be revamped. India, unlike its developed  counterparts, has been far less affected by the recent turmoil but still has a long way  to go in terms of achieving a sustained higher and inclusive growth. And for the  Indian economy to achieve this goal, banking sector would undoubtedly need to play  an extremely critical role. But, for that to happen, banks need to optimally leverage  technology to increase penetration, improve their productivity and efficiency, deliver  cost-effective products and services, provide faster, efficient and convenient  customer service, and, thereby, contribute to the overall growth and development of  the country. And in order to make the dream of growth coupled with inclusion a  reality, Indian banking sector today needs to make a promise, a promise to the  customer, especially the small and retail customer, and to the society at large, to  make banking transactions faster, cheaper and easier in the next decade.  This then  brings me to the topic of my address today which is Banking Transactions in the  Next Decade: Faster, Cheaper and Easier.     2. Why banking sector should and can make such a promise now? First of all,  because we have not been able to fully realise the promise of the last decade.  We  were constrained by our ability as, till a few years ago, appropriate banking  technology was not available. But, now, with the availability of appropriate banking                                                    1  Special address by Dr K. C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, RBI at a Panel Session on   Transactions in the next decade: Faster, Cheaper and Easier at the ninth FICCI-IBA Conference on  Global Banking: Paradigm Shift, Sep 8, 2010 at Mumbai    1   technology, the time has come when the Indian banking system can make and  deliver on that promise.     3. Technology enables increased penetration of the banking system, increases cost  effectiveness and makes small value transactions viable. Besides making banking  products and services affordable and accessible; it simultaneously ensures viability  and profitability of providers. Increased penetration brings further reduction in costs,  which, in turn, attracts more people to avail the services. Technology allows  transactions to take place faster and offers unparalleled convenience through  various delivery channels. Technology enhances choices, creates new markets, and  improves productivity and efficiency. Effective use of technology has a multiplier  effect on growth and development.     4. The question then arises, have we not developed banking technology and delivery  models over the last two decades since we embarked on economic reforms. The  answer undoubtedly is in affirmative. There are a number of achievements that can  be highlighted in the field of banking technology and banking transactions during the  last decade.   Achievements of the last decade  5. One of the major objectives of banking sector reforms in India was to promote  flexibility, operational autonomy and competition in the system and to raise the  banking standards in India to the international best practices (Reddy, 2002). There  has been an all-round improvement in the health of the banking sector in the post- reform period especially during the last decade.    6. The adoption of technology has changed the face of the banking sector which can  be seen from various transformational developments in the recent past. Core  Banking Solution enables banks to extend the full benefits of ATM, mobile banking,  tele-banking, internet banking, and card banking, etc. to all customers. It allows  banks to offer a multitude of services on a 24x7 basis from a single location as well  as all possible delivery channels existing and proposed. The centralisation thus  makes a one-stop shop for financial services a possibility. Using CBS, customers  can access their accounts from any branch, anywhere, irrespective of where they  have physically opened their accounts.   2   7. In the area of payment and settlement system, where technology impacts the  customer transactions most, there have been significant advancements. We are one  of the countries that has effectively tackled huge volumes of paper instruments in a  cost effective manner. The MICR cheque clearing system processes a staggering  4.5 million cheques on a single day! The Cheque Truncation System (CTS) is  another innovative solution that has been developed to enhance the efficiency of  paper based clearing system. CTS has eliminated the need for physical movements  of cheques. Speed clearing has been introduced by the Reserve Bank to reduce the  time taken in clearing up-country cheques and take advantage of and leverage the  core banking technology adopted by banks.     8. The advent of electronic payment modes has speeded up transaction processing  and settlement. The NECS, with its centralised processing capability coupled with  the implementation of Core Banking Solutions (CBS) has brought down the clearing  and settlement cycle to its current T+1 basis. Electronic Fund Transfer  (EFT)/National EFT (NEFT) is another illustration, where better process re- engineering coupled with CBS and strict adherence to NEFT procedural guidelines  has made this product offer fund transfer service on a near real time basis to  customers. Apart from these retail payment systems, we have the Real Time Gross  Settlement (RTGS) for large value transactions. Thus what technology has done is  provided speedier clearing and settlement of transactions, i.e. it has helped us in  achieving to traverse a portion of the existing path faster.  9. Given this background, let me pose a few questions.    How far has technology enabled us to provide faster transactions to our  limited pool of customers?    Has technology driven down costs for banks and customers?    Have we been successful in using technology to make things easier or  convenient for the customer?   10. Let me admit that much of what I would say is based on anecdotal evidence and  there is a paucity of empirical evidence backed by hard data to conclusively answer  these questions. Detailed research is needed in this area. Also, let us by definition  not restrict a transaction to just clearing and settlement transaction but a wider term  3   to denote a complete transaction from a customers perspective. This would typically  include not only the time to complete the transaction but also the dispute resolution  in case of failure. Then let us try to answer if technology has enabled faster  transactions. The answer would be a yes as far as bigger customers are concerned.  But, what about small and retail customers especially when there is a problem? If we  take the average time of the successful, semi-successful and failed transactions, I  am afraid that the answer to this question may well be no.  To illustrate, I would  recall complaints related to ATM transactions when account is debited and cash is  not dispensed. As you would be aware, charged with numerous complaints by  customers and the inordinate delays faced by them for the banks to re-credit their  accounts, the Reserve Bank has now imposed a mandatory timeframe of 12 days  within which the customers account has to be credited, failing which a penalty of  Rs.100 per day is payable by the bank to the customer. In a CBS environment, why  should reconciliation take such a long time leading to customer inconvenience and  regulatory intervention on behalf of the customer?   11. I will illustrate with another example. Technology has provided us the comfort of  internet banking from our desk tops. As a prudent security measure, the customer is  logged out of his account after entering his password incorrectly three times. He then  either goes to the branch or contacts the toll-free number for issue of a new  password. But why does it take ten days to issue a new password to the customer  and a further additional two days to activate the password after the customer duly  authenticates and acknowledges receipt of the password? Is it not necessary that  the whole process is speeded up substantially to enable the customer to start  operating his internet banking facility at the earliest?   12. Has technology driven down costs for banks and customers? In order to provide  various services banks have had to incur capital costs for various technology  solutions. These include the implementation of the Core Banking Solution, putting up  ATMs, providing connectivity between branches, etc. But with the implementation of  state-of-the-art technological solutions, have the operating costs of banks come  down? Logically, they should have over a period of time and then the banks should  start deriving a return on the asset. Has this come about?  4   13. The Net Interest Margin of banks has not reduced much; especially when the  structure of business has not changed. The Net Interest Margin (NIM), which reflects  the difference between the interest earned and interest expended (as per cent of  total assets), which stood at 3.37 per cent in 1992 declined to 2.95 per cent in 2000  and was slightly lower at 2.63 per cent in 2009 (Table 1).  The ratio of urban and  metro to total business has been increasing signifying that the structure of the  business has remained same.  During the period, the operating costs to total assets  has come down gradually but not as drastically as one would have expected due to  the introduction of technology. The intermediation costs of banks in India still tend to  be higher than those in developed banking markets.

Yet, the question remains how far has the customer benefited from this increase  in income of banks. I would like to say that very little of the benefits earned by banks  in todays liberalised environment have been passed on to the customers. There is  enough empirical evidence to show that the cost of small transactions has not gone  down. I will give only one example of low value draft issuance charges. Unless low- value transactions are cost-effectively done, it is not going to impact efficiency  drastically.  15. As regards actual measurement of transaction costs, there are almost no studies  which actually quantify in a systematic way the exact level of costs in financial  transactions from a customers point of view. Incidentally, I would like the IBA to look  into this issue and initiate studies on a regular basis for understanding the cost of  transactions for small and retail customers.   5   16. Have we been successful in using technology to make things easier or  convenient for the customer?  No doubt, technology has the potential to extend in a  cost effective manner the penetrative reach of banking services and products to a  large section of the excluded society. But let us look at some of the critical indicators  for access to finance and performance and efficiency of banks in India along with  benchmark indicators for selected high-income OECD member countries that are  given in annex table 1. The penetration indicators reveal that there have been  improvements during 2001-08 but is still very adverse as compared to OECD  economies.  17. Is it any easier to open a deposit account? Can a person get a loan easily and  quickly? I have numerous anecdotal evidences including the one by my domestic  help who in a metropolis like Mumbai, spent two days of her labour time running  around completing formalities to open a basic savings account with a renowned  bank.   18. We all talk about single window operation in banks but has it really happened?  Here, I would again to like to bring in my favourite example of the Indian Railways, a  public sector organisation, which has managed to provide its customers with a single  window service facility related to all transactions such as ticketing, cancellation,  enquiry, etc. for any train, destination or class. Let us introspect and answer, have  we as bankers come any closer to that?   19. I shall also draw your attention towards another aspect of customer convenience  evidenced in the number of rising complaints. Data from the Banking Ombudsman  offices show that number of complaints excluding credit card related complaints per  1 million accounts rose from 75 complaints in 2006-07 to 245 complaints in 2008-09.  What is even more noteworthy is that if public sector banks had about 165  complaints per 1 million accounts in 2008-09, the corresponding figures for private  sector banks was more than double at 377 (406 for new generation private sector  banks) and 851 for foreign banks in 2008-09. Moreover, we have all the reason to  believe that many of these complaints are received at urban and metropolitan  centres, where the common persons are much more aware of such mechanisms of  expressing their grievances. It is needless to stress that to make banking  6   transactions more convenient for the customer, a quick and effective grievance  redressal system is essential.  20. Thus, it can be summarized that the opportunities presented by adoption of  technology could not be fully exploited and the customer still has not been able to  enjoy faster, cheaper, and easier banking services. The obvious question then to ask  is why this has not happened. I will draw upon my address last week at the  Economic Times Banking Technology Conclave 2010 where I have identified the  following reasons:  a)  Absence of a strategic vision and action plan  For a plan to succeed there must be a vision and strategy driving  implementation. There is clearly an absence of vision of how technology is  going to drive business and customer relationship.  Thus technology adoption  in banks is a result of external pressures rather than a vision shared by the  bank staff percolating right down from right up or a corporate vision of the  positive externalities that will result. Consequently, this lack of long-term  vision and strategy has impacted the way technology has been utilised.   b) Technology focus was not customer-centric  Technology must be implemented with the customer in focus. Technology  must enable customer facilitation in terms of cost, time and convenience. It  should be dovetailed to customer needs and expectations. In sharp contrast,  technology implementation in our public sector banks appears to be more for  regulatory and policy compliance. This has oriented the banking technology to  be more employee-friendly rather than customer-friendly.   c)   Business Process Re-engineering was not done  Business process re-engineering integral to leverage manpower for business  growth and increased profitability, and cetirus paribus to derive optimum  benefits of technology up gradation, has not happened at the desired pace.  Globally, post technology adoption, only 10 per cent of the banking staff is  involved in back office jobs and the remaining 90 per cent of the banking  staff are freed for performing front office jobs of customer acquisition,  servicing and retention by ensuring customer loyalty. The net result was  tinkering with parts rather than the needed systemic overhaul that could have  7   been achieved had the banks adopted a planned transformational  management system.   d) Absence of simple cost effective delivery model  We are yet to put in place a cost- effective, decentralised and realistic delivery  model. Fledgling delivery models are being tried out experimentally. Fixing a  problem / glitch when it happens is the weakest link. This issue is even more  important considering that increasingly larger number of hitherto un-banked  people will interface with the banks through hand-held/ mobile front-end  devices. The credibility of the entire system will be at stake and take a hit if  the problems are not promptly resolved as they arise and real time solutions  are not proffered.   e) Information and Technology was segregated   There was no business and IT plan to leverage technology for increasing  business and profits. IT should help banks not just to deliver robust and  reliable services to their customers at a lower cost, but also generate and  manage information effectively. Information comprises data collected based  on principles of integrity, reliability, and accuracy. Banks are collecting  humungous quantities and warehousing volumes of data relating to customers  and transactions. The information is not subjected to meaningful analysis,  usage and creation of a database with an objective to meet not only the  diversified internal and external MIS requirements but also using this  information to increase the volume of profitable business using unique  techniques of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). It would not be  wrong to say that Information from Information Technology is missing.   f) Non-availability of Infrastructure  Banking penetration through ICT models or otherwise requires some basic  infrastructure to be in place. There needs to be robust digital and physical  infrastructure for banking services to reach un-banked and inaccessible  areas.     g) Lack of collaborative efforts  Since, the challenge is huge, a planned, strategic and massive concerted  effort is needed from all stakeholders which was not well appreciated earlier.  It is now well recognized that taking banking to the masses and providing  8   cheaper, easier and faster service requires a greater collaborative effort which  was lacking earlier.    19. So what then is the way ahead and what should we do? I have five major  observations to make about the way we need to envisage banking or financial  technology in the years to come. This naturally draws upon the reasons that I have  just narrated above which in my opinion have hampered the full benefits of  technology being leveraged by banks for fuelling growth and development.   a) An integrated IT plan and Business Plan and an integrated IT and Business  strategy is a must. A long-term vision and strategy on how technology can be  harnessed to deliver on business goals needs to be framed and percolated  down the organisation.  b) Appropriate technology and efficient Delivery Model:  All our efforts would not  bear fruit if technology issues are not addressed first. Till today, not all  commercial bank and regional rural bank branches are under CBS.  Scalable  financial inclusion cannot happen without stable and reliable Information and  Communications Technology (ICT) based models. The transactions through  the hand held front end-devices should be seamlessly integrated with banks  back-end servers. In our interaction with the banks, we are stressing that the  technology aspects deserves our immediate attention. We need to closely  analyse whether any technology/vendor/systems shortcomings is hindering  the optimal beneficial utilisation of CBS both for centralisation of the back-end  processes and information processing capabilities.  Banks must refine their  Delivery Models for greater effectiveness and efficiency. BC based delivery  model has been made more flexible and inclusive.  c) Technology has to be customer-centric in every sense of the term. It has to be  a technology driven towards drawing in the entire mass of small and retail  customers into the banking system. As we know that globally 90 per cent of  the banking staff is involved in front office jobs of enhancing customer base  and ensuring customer loyalty. In India, however, the situation is exactly the  reverse.   d) Proper IT Governance structure: Technology should not only reduce cost of  transactions and improve the delivery model but also help banks generate  and manage information effectively. In order to strengthen the delivery  channel, banks need a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management  (CRM) solution which would enable them to access the entire customer  details and provide a unified view across channels and products to enhance  9   service quality. For CRM to function well, we need to develop IT governance  structure, which can provide effective control on the existing IT infrastructure  created by banks. This would ultimately result in enabling better alignment  between IT and Business, create efficiencies, enhance conformity to  internationally accepted best practices and improve overall IT performance of  banks. An important aspect of IT governance is the need to address  enhanced security concerns associated with technology. We need to ensure  that information and technology are integrated.  e) Collaborative efforts by all stakeholders: It is essential to create shared  interests and proactive involvement of all the players. Even after all these  efforts, banks alone will not be able to do it if all stakeholders like  Governments, both Central and State, Regulators, NGOs, Technology  Vendors, Industry Associations, Insurance and Mutual Fund Companies, and  society at large are not involved. Big technology players have to come forward  to facilitate this process and develop hardware and software appropriate to  our country.   Conclusion:  20. In conclusion, I would like to say that the progress made by banks during the last  decade is commendable. The health of the banking system is strong, they have  adopted technology, and are making efforts at increasing penetration. However, the  benefit of technology has not percolated to common people. As a result, banking  transactions have not become cheaper, easier and faster due to deficiency in  delivery model, absence of BPR, as also lack of infrastructure.  What is needed at  this stage is a planned, strategic and massive collaborative effort from all  stakeholders to leverage technology in an effective way, bringing more people into  banking fold, reducing costs and, thereby, ensuring benefits of technology indeed  results in cheaper, easier and faster transactions, particularly for our small and retail  customers. I hope the deliberations of this conference will identify the issues, work  out an action plan and implement them so that the banking system can truly deliver  on its promise for the year 2020. This will go a long way in ensuring a sustainable  and inclusive growth in the society.    Thank you for inviting me here to share my thoughts with you all.          10     Select References:   1.
