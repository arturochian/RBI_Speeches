•Development of Debt Markets in IndiaMr. Chairman, Honourable Finance Minister Yashwant Sinhaji, Mr.Lim and friends,At the outset, I would like to thank The World Bank for organising this high-level wellattended, interactive, business-like seminar on a subject of high priority for India. Mypresentation would start with features and magnitudes of debt market in India and briefly touchon policy developments since 1991-92. Significant reforms in debt markets undertaken since lastyear will then be recalled, I will conclude by placing before you, what we consider to be theagenda for further action. I trust that this would facilitate your appreciating both the currentstatus of debt markets and our intentions for the immediate future, and thus assist in making yourbusiness plans. We also hope to benefit from your comments and advice on these matters.• Address by Dr.Y.V.Reddy, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at Conference on Private Investment inInfrastructure in India, at Paris, on November 2, 1998.* I am grateful to Dr.A.Prasad for his valuable assistance.Features and MagnitudesThe debt markets in India comprise basically three segments, viz., Government SecuritiesMarket, which is oldest and most dominant; PSU Bonds Market, which is basically adevelopment since late `eighties; and Corporate Securities Market, which is growing fast afterliberalisation, especially in the last two years. The major focus in the development of debtmarkets has been the Government Securities Market for three reasons. First, it constitutes theprincipal segment of our debt market. Second, as a market for sovereign paper, it has a role insetting benchmarks in the financial markets as a whole. Third, it is critical in bringing about aneffective and reliable transmission channel for the use of indirect instruments of monetarycontrol.The outstanding securities of the Central and State Governments as on March 31, 1998amounted to over Rs. 4,000 billion and a significant part of it is held by commercial banks whohave statutory obligations in holding such securities in their portfolio. Reflecting the increasingdepth in the Government Securities market, the aggregate volume of transactions in Central andState Government securities and Treasury Bills (outright and repos) was significantly higher atRs.1,857 billion in 1997-98 as compared with Rs.1,229 billion in 1996-97. The average monthlyvolume of outright transactions in Government dated securities during 1997-98 was higher atRs.100 billion than that of Rs.50 billion during 1996-97.Outstanding corporate debt as at end March 1998 (inclusive of private placement) isestimated to be around Rs.1,100 billion. The Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) at National StockExchange (NSE) continued to witness sharp expansion during 1997-98 as the number ofsecurities listed on the WDM segment rose to 418 from 307 during 1996-97. The number ofactive securities rose from 525 to 719 while the number of active participants also increased to79 from 73 during 1996-97. The average daily turnover during 1997-98 was Rs.4 billion ascompared with Rs.1.5 billion during 1996-97.                                            ..1Several new instruments such as deep discount bond, securitised debt, PSU infrastructurebond, Government index bond, corporate floating rate bond and institutional tax free bonds wereadded to the debt segment in the recent past.Early Policy Developments in Debt MarketSince the ‘sixties and until the ‘nineties, the Government Securities market remaineddormant since the Government was borrowing at preannounced coupon rates from basically acaptive group of investors, such as banks. So, we had a passive internal debt management policy.This, coupled with automatic monetisation of budget deficit prevented a deep and vibrantGovernment Securities market. Internal debt management became an active instrument of policysince economic reform of the ‘nineties, with the main objectives of smoothening the maturitystructure of debt, enabling debt to be raised at close-to market rates, and improving liquidity bydevelopment of an active secondary market. Reforms instituted by the RBI, in close coordinationwith Government of India included the selling of Government Securities through auctions,introduction of new instruments such as zero coupon bonds, floating rate bonds and capital indexbonds, introduction of Treasury Bills of varying maturities, conversion of Treasury Bills intodated securities, establishment of specialised institutions such as DFHI and STCI, institution ofsystem of Primary Dealers in Government Securities, operationalising the Delivery VersusPayment System for settlement, transparency in dissemination of information relating to volumesand yields, prescribing standard valuation norms, etc.Significant reforms in the non-Government debt market should also be recognised.National and local stock exchanges have been established where trading in corporate andGovernment debt is done on the exchanges through screen based systems. Securities andExchange Board of India (SEBI) was established, which regulates the primary issuances incapital and debt markets other than Government securities and ensures sound trading practices inthe secondary market through stock exchanges. Depositories have been set up for equity and debtto facilitate dematerialisation and easier and safer transfer and settlement. Also, there is completetransparency in trades in Government Securities settled through the book entry system ofSubsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounts by the Reserve Bank of India and other debttransacted through the National Stock Exchange. Information on trades settled through thecentral depository with RBI is disseminated to market participants to enable them to have accessto data on volumes and prices in the secondary markets.Reform in Debt Markets since 1997-98Since April 1997, a number of structural and institutional changes in the differentsegments of financial markets have been brought about, and these include debt markets,especially the Government Securities and money markets.2Introduction of Scheme of Ways and Means Advances to Central GovernmentAs long as automatic monetisation existed, it was difficult to assure a framework forGovernment securities market in terms of matching demand and supply through pricemechanism. Hence, the most significant development during 1997-98 has been the elimination ofthe practice of automatic monetisation of the Central Government budget deficit through ad hocTreasury Bills with effect from April 1, 1997 and the introduction of a new scheme of Ways andMeans Advances (WMA). The Government can avail of WMA within prescribed limits(currently Rs. 11,000 crore for the first half of the year i.e., April-September and Rs.7,000 crorefor the second half of the year, i.e., October-March). The rate of interest on WMA is linked tothe Bank Rate. Consequent upon this, the outstanding ad hoc and tap Treasury Bills (T-Bills)were converted and added to the stock of special securities with RBI, without any specifiedmaturity, at an interest rate of 4.6 per cent. During 1997-98, special securities to the tune ofRs.20,000 crore were converted into marketable securities of varying maturities, in order toaugment the stock of marketable securities for active open market operations. It may be pointedout that during the early part of 1997-98, the RBI had to resort to sterilised intervention in themanagement of capital inflows. Also, a scheme of 14-Day Intermediate Treasury Bills wasintroduced in the place of 91-Day tap Treasury Bills to enable State Governments, foreigncentral banks and special bodies to invest their temporary cash surpluses.Introduction of 14-Day Auction of Treasury Bills14-Day Treasury Bills were introduced in June 1997 on a weekly auction basis with aview to developing the Treasury Bills market further and providing investors with financialinstruments of varying short-term maturities and to facilitate the cash management requirementof various financial market participants. Thus, investors now have the option to invest in 14-Day,91-Day and 364-Day Treasury Bills.A few announcements such as the introduction of 28-Day Treasury Bills, reintroductionof 182-Day Treasury Bills and changes in the frequency of Treasury Bills auctions were put onhold since there was reduced investor interest in Treasury Bills due to unprecedented marketdevelopments. Uniform price auction in respect of 91-Day Treasury Bills is proposed to beintroduced soon as an experimental measure. Uniform price auction method is expected toeliminate the problem of winner’s curse and encourage more aggressive bidding in the primarymarket.Pre-announcing Notified Amounts in AuctionsFor enhancing the credibility of the auction process and the development of secondarymarkets, a transparent auction system and market clearing yields through the primary auctionsare significant preconditions. To foster market clearing rates in the primary market and bringingabout more transparency in auctions, the RBI is now pre-announcing notified amounts inauctions of Treasury Bills (14-Day, 91-Day and 364-Day) and dated securities.3Currently, fifty per cent of the notified amounts in auctions are being offered to PrimaryDealers for underwriting, thus reducing the scope for devolvement on RBI, though there is somecost in terms of underwriting fee. In order to minimise the possibility of devolvement on theRBI, the notified amounts are also varied from time to time to reflect the market demand.Non-Competitive BidsAs another measure towards more efficient market clearing pricing in auctions, non-competitive bids are now kept outside the notified amounts. Until the current financial year, non-competitive bids in 14-Day and 91-Day Treasury Bills auctions were being allocated bidamounts within the notified amount and this practice was found to distort the auction process.Country practices do show that non-competitive bids are made allocation within the notifiedamount, but in those countries, the bidders comprise essentially small and retail investors. InIndia, however, State Governments are major non-competitive bidders who have large andvolatile surplus funds positions and these render the pricing pattern and allotment of bidsuncertain for competitive bidders.Retailing of Government SecuritiesAs I mentioned earlier, since the ‘sixties, a retail market for Government securitiesceased to exist. However, since the beginning of reform, it has been recognised that a strongretail segment for Government securities needs to be developed. The Reserve Bank of India hasbeen actively trying to promote this objective. First, one of the major objectives of setting up theprimary dealers and satellite dealers systems was to enhance the distribution channels andencourage voluntary holding of Government securities among a wider investor base. Further, inorder to facilitate the Satellite Dealers (SDs) in their objectives of trading and distribution ofGovernment Securities, a scheme for availing liquidity support from the RBI has been madeavailable to them. Secondly, the RBI announced special liquidity support for dedicated giltfunds. However, not much interest has been evinced in this channel so far. Thirdly, banks arenow allowed to freely buy and sell Government Securities on an outright basis and retailGovernment securities to non-bank clients, without any restriction on the period between saleand purchase. This is meant to promote the retail market segment and to provide greater liquidityto retail investors. Fourthly, with a view to enabling dematerialisation of securities of retailholders, institutions such as National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL), Stock HoldingCorporation of India Limited (SHCIL) and National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd.(NSCCL) have been allowed to open SGL Accounts with the RBI. Furthermore, SDs have alsobeen extended the facility of repo transactions (as lenders) since March 1998.Strengthening Dealers SystemIn order to make the Government securities market vibrant, liquid and broadbased and to ensuredevelopment of underwriting and market making capabilities outside the RBI, a system ofPrimary Dealers was established. The Primary Dealers’ presence in the Government Securitiesmarket has brought about an element of dynamism, both in the primary and secondary segments.The RBI has been facilitating the operation of Primary Dealers through a variety of measures.4Liquidity support is being provided to PDs by the RBI.Since some operational problems were observed in the form of liquidity support throughrepos, the RBI dispensed with the practice of reverse repos with Primary Dealers in specifiedsecurities and instead agreed to provide liquidity support against the security of holdings in SGLaccounts. The PDs are in the process of switching over to the new system.A system of payment of underwriting fees on the amounts underwritten by them throughcompetitive bids is in place. In order to facilitate their continued presence in auctions, the RBIinvites bids for underwriting in respect of all auctions. Routing operations in the call moneymarket are allowed through PDs. In order to facilitate ease of operations, PDs have been allowedto open a current account and two SGL accounts (one for their own investments and the other forclients) with the RBI. Further, they are allowed the facility of transfer of funds from one centreto another under the RBI’s Remittance Facility Scheme. Recently, the Primary DealersAssociation of India was formed as a self-regulatory organisation. The PDs are in activecoordination with the RBI on various aspects of financial markets.The RBI has recently enlarged the number of PDs from 6 to 13 by announcing in-principle agreement to register 7 PDs. The addition of 7 more PDs (DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd.,Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd., Ceat Financial Services Ltd., Tata Finance SecuritiesLtd., JP Morgan Securities India Pvt. Ltd., ABN Amro Bank Subsidiary and Deutsche BankSubsidiary), is expected to increase activities in terms of liquidity and depth both in the primaryand secondary markets.Investment in Central Government Securities by FIIsTo widen the participants in the debt market, including Government securities, it was feltthat foreign institutional investors should also be permitted to operate, though such participationhad to be consistent with overall ceilings on external commercial borrowings.FIIs were, however, allowed to operate only in dated Government Securities in theprimary and secondary markets, including those with remaining maturities of less than one yearuntil April 1998. Their entry in Treasury Bills market was deferred pending rationalisation ofauction procedures. With the commencement of pre-announcement of notified amounts inrespect of Treasury Bills auctions and exclusion of non-competitive bids from the notifiedamounts, FIIs are now permitted to purchase/sell Treasury Bills within the overall approved debtceilings. FIIs’  investments in debt instruments are permitted to be fully covered in the forwardforeign exchange market.Ready Forward TransactionsIn our market, two types of repos are currently in operation – inter bank repo includingPDs and the RBI repo which is used for absorption/injection of liquidity. After the irregularitiesin securities transactions in 1992, interbank repos are permitted under regulated conditions witheligible participants and instruments being generally restricted and expanded gradually.5In order to further expand the base in the interbank repos market, the participation wasextended to non-bank entities that had already access to call money market as lenders. Reposhave also been permitted in PSU bonds and private corporate debt securities provided they areheld in dematerialised form in a depository and the transactions are done in recognised stockexchanges.  This will be operationalised after Government issues a clarification regardingapplicability of stamp duties on dematerialised instruments.In the most recent monetary and credit policy, the RBI removed the restriction of aminimum period of 3 days for inter bank repo transactions. This would further enable banks andother participants in the repo market to adjust their liquidity in a more flexible manner.In recent months, open market operations of the RBI, both through outright sales ofGovernment Securities and repo operations have gained considerable momentum. At present, theRBI conducts three-day and four-day repos in the market. The primary objective of theseoperations is to absorb or provide liquidity from/to the market, though under certaincircumstances, repos have also been used to signal changes in interest rates. The monetary andcredit policy for the first half of 1998-99 proposed to use both fixed interest and auction basedrepos, as appropriate. It also stated that in addition to the current three-day and four-day repos,RBI will, in due course, use one-day repos (including reverse repos) to absorb (or infuse)liquidity into the system. With the continuous availability of fixed rate repos for absorption ofliquidity, the proposal to use one-day repos/reverse repos for liquidity adjustment has beendeferred. In view of the current market conditions, the fixed rate repos will be continued forsome more time. Use of auction repos will have to be considered at an appropriate stage.Agenda for Further ActionSince the introduction of the reform measures, the various segments of the financialmarket have responded favourably and become increasingly integrated. Although significantprogress has been made in the debt markets also, a number of rigidities persist and major issuesstill need to be tackled keeping in view a consistent framework. The framework that shouldcontinue to govern our agenda for further action may be summarised as under :• Establish a transparent and credible price discovery process in the primary market• Develop a vibrant, liquid and broadbased secondary market• Evolve standard procedures, documentation and code of conduct for transactions in securities• Improve the institutional infrastructure by further strengthening the primary and satellitedealers systems• Support and encourage self regulatory bodies• Develop wide retail network• Ensure a smooth, well functioning and efficient settlement system• Upgrade technology and set up an electronic dealing system• Create an enabling legal structure• Establish a strong regulatory framework• Ensure transparency in operations, proper disclosure and quick information dissemination. The actions required for this purpose may be classified into areas relating to legal, technology,regulatory and market microstructure, retailing, standardisation and risk management.6Legal IssuesRepeal and Replacement of Public Debt ActThe Government Securities and their management by the Reserve Bank of India isgoverned by the Public Debt Act, 1944. The procedures prescribed are archaic and some of theprovisions have ceased to be of relevance in the present context. A new legislation titled theGovernment Securities Act proposes to repeal and replace the Public Debt Act. The GovernmentSecurities Bill has already been approved by the Cabinet and is awaiting Parliament clearance.However, since the Public Debt Act, 1944, is applicable for marketable loans raised by the RBIon behalf of both the Central and State Governments, the proposal requires consent of all StateGovernments. The State Governments have to pass a Resolution for the purpose either prior toenactment by the Centre or subsequently adopt the same by passing a Resolution. Once the newAct is enacted, the RBI will have substantive powers to design and introduce an instrument oftransfer suited to computer environment. The new Act will also give flexibility to allowGovernment Securities to be held in Depositories while at the same time specifically excludingGovernment Securities from the purview of Depositories Act, 1996.Amendments to Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956In order to curb certain unhealthy trends that had developed in the securities market andto prevent undesirable speculation, the Government had prohibited forward trading in securitiesin June 1969 through a Notification. It is held that rescinding this Notification is now necessaryfor the development of the securities market. Simultaneously, there is a proposal to amend theSCRA to add an enabling provision to provide jurisdiction to the RBI also in the regulation ofthe debt markets. With this, the respective regulatory roles of SEBI and RBI in the debt marketwill be formalised. The proposed changes in the SCRA will pave way for a more active reposmarket and introduction of new market features like when-issued trading.Stamp Duty ReformDevelopment of financial markets is being inhibited by multiple prescriptions of stampduty which is creating friction in active secondary market trading by increasing the transactioncost and administrative hassles. Although the State Governments claim right to levy stamp duty,exemption of financial instruments from stamp duty is advocated in the interest of developmentof efficient financial markets. Repos in private corporate securities in dematerialised formthrough a depository have stalled on this count. In regard to instruments which fall within thejurisdiction of Central Government, such as promissory note and transfer of shares, they havealready been granted remission by Central Government. State Governments may be finding itdifficult to grant remission to financial transactions since for the purpose of stamp duty almostall items fall within the description of financial transactions excepting a couple of items.7A Group is actively monitoring the progress on Stamp Duty Reform. This is a matter ofcrucial importance and exemption of debt instruments from stamp duty or alternativelyrationalisation of the procedures by imposing a flat fee would go a long way in increasingsecondary market activity and liquidity in debt instruments. The suggestion that the Indian StampAct be amended to enact a specific provision exempting transactions of all securities inDepository in dematerialised form from stamp duty also needs to be seriously considered.TechnologyTechnological upgradation in Debt MarketDevelopment of technology is an integral part of reforming the debt market, especially inthe context of providing a technologically superior dealing and settlement system. Hence, theRBI has embarked upon the technological upgradation of debt market. This includes screen-based trade reporting system with the use of VSAT communication network complemented by acentralised Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounting system. It will be integrated with theregional current account system. The existing system provides paper based DVP system at theoffices of RBI. The operationalisation of trade reporting will facilitate logging bids in theauctions of dated securities and treasury bills to other parts of the country which is presentlyavailable at Mumbai. This will broaden the participation in the auction system, help enlarging theinvestor’s base and increase the competitiveness in the auction system. The centralised SGLaccounting system will improve the speed of settlement of secondary market transactions.The operationalisation of VSAT by end of December 1998 will provide on- line linkagesbetween offices of RBI, Central Government (Ministry of Finance), monitoring of Governmentfinance (receipts and expenditures) and also among other participants (banks/primarydealers/satellite dealers/financial institutions). This will open new areas in technologicaldevelopment of payment systems.Y2K Compliance by Primary Dealers and Satellite Dealers (System Software andHardware) with the target date December 1998 are also being monitored.Electronic Dealing SystemElectronic dealing systems lend transparency and efficiency to market operations. Ideally,the screen could cover OTC deals in money market instruments like call and notice money, termmoney, repos, as also Government Securities including Treasury Bills. Besides banks, PDs,financial institutions and other market participants, the RBI could use the screen in the conductof its open market operations as also for monitoring money/securities market activity.The RBI is actively coordinating with the Primary Dealers Association in developing anElectronic Dealing System to facilitate dealing in call, notice and term money, Treasury Bills,Government Securities and repos. This is expected to be operationalised by March 1999.8Regulation of Private PlacementIn the PSU and corporate bonds market, a crucial issue relates to large resources raisedthrough private placement. For instance, private placements increased by as much as 80 per centduring 1997-98 to Rs.27,069 crore, accounting for 85 per cent of the resources mobilised fromthe primary market. The share of public sector in total private placements remained high at 68per cent of total private placements but much lower than its share of 83 per cent in 1996-97. Thispopularity of private placement may be attributed to the low issuance cost, ease of structuringinstruments, saving on time lag in issuance. Notwithstanding these benefits, healthy developmentof the private placement market calls for more transparency, better disclosure and protection ofinvestors’ interest.An Informal Group on Primary Market under the Chairmanship of Dr. Shankar Acharyaalso looked at the issue of private placement. The Group has recommended that the facility ofprivate placement should be restricted to not more than 99 qualified institutional investors andshould be tradable on OTCEI. The Group also recommended that financialinstitutions/banks/mutual funds which participate in private placement should mandatorily giveinformation on a regular basis to SEBI and the RBI.Market MicrostructureAs pointed out earlier, a number of measures have been implemented to develop theprimary and secondary markets. A number of suggestions have been recently received towardsfurther development of the markets and these are listed here though they are yet to be examined.a) At present, PDs underwrite a sizeable proportion of the market loans and quote anunderwriting commission. In case of a devolvement, PDs are allotted at the cut-off rate.There is a suggestion that PDs should be required to ensure that in each auction they putin a minimum percentage of the notified amount and with the increase in the number ofPDs, the minimum bids of all PDs taken together should be 100 per cent of the notifiedamount. The point that is stressed is that PDs should be given allocations only at the priceor yield at which they have bid and should not be given a forced allocation at an artificialcut off.b) RBI should not participate in the primary auctions, but in the transition it could take up to20 per cent of the notified amount, subject to a pre-announced policy. If, after the 20 percent devolvement, the issue is not fully subscribed, the RBI should have the option ofcancelling the entire auction.c) Initially, the RBI should move out of 14-Day and 91-Day primary auctions and then the364-Day auctions. Thereafter, it could gradually phase out its presence from the datedsecurities auctions.d) With the withdrawal from the primary market, the RBI would need to establish a strongpresence in the secondary market with two-way quotes.e) The RBI could consider price-based bidding at auctions.9f) Preparatory work towards introduction of Futures/STRIPS and other value-added featuresshould commence.Retailing of Government SecuritiesAs I alluded earlier, there is an imperative need to generate a strong retail segment of thegilt market. The RBI has already established the institutional infrastructure for retailing bysetting up the system of Primary Dealers and Satellite Dealers in Government securities market.PDs and SDs should take up this task earnestly and move ahead in building awareness amongretail investors about Government securities. There is a view that the capital of PDs need to beenhanced not only to accommodate the increasing size of Government securities market but alsoto further increase the commitment of PDs to fresh issuances, market making and distributioncapabilities.Another eminent way of retailing Government securities is through the gilt fund route.Currently, the tax concession for gilt funds is clubbed with other 80L instruments and a case hasbeen made out for giving exclusive tax exemptions for income earned from gilts and gilt funds.Also, there have been suggestions that investment in the units of dedicated gilt funds should betreated as SLR securities. These suggestions need further examination.The opening of SGL account with NSDL was also expected to increase the retail segmentof the Government Securities Market. This will become operational once SEBI issues necessaryclarifications exempting Government Securities from their jurisdiction.Standardisation of PracticesStandard practices in the market need to be evolved with regard to the manner of quotes,conclusion of deals, etc. Code of best practices has to be evolved for repo transactions. It isproposed to ensure that the Primary Dealers Association and FIMMDAI quickly set up a timeframe for standardising the documentation and market practices and if need be the RBI willcome forward and indicate a time frame. Most importantly, the code of conduct will have to becompatible with the contemplated dealing screen and the technological upgradation.10Risk ManagementInvestors in debt instruments face three major types of risk, viz., credit risk, interest raterisk and foreign currency risk. In case of Government bonds, credit risk is zero. Non-residentinvestors like FIIs who are prone to currency risk have already been permitted to take forwardcover to enable them to hedge their currency risk. Investment in all debt instruments is exposedto interest rate risk. Introduction of rupee derivatives will go a long way in providing instrumentsfor investors to hedge their exposures. The Reserve Bank has decided in principle to create anenvironment that would facilitate introduction of interest rate swaps. The RBI proposes toexamine in consultation with market participants, relevant aspects such as standarddocumentation, benchmark rate, prudential prescriptions, etc. before allowing the product in themarket.ConclusionIn conclusion, significant progress has been made with regard to the development of debtmarkets in India. The RBI is taking active interest in creating legal and institutional framework,evolve standardised procedures and code of conduct, upgrade technology and establish a strongregulatory framework. As you would have noted, the agenda that was just set out is complex.Successful completion of the agenda would require close coordination between the RBI andGovernment and cooperation from the market participants.I solicit your suggestions and advice.Thank you.11
