1Global Imbalances- An Indian PerspectiveHonourable Under Secretary General, Mr. Ocampo, Ambassador Nirupam Senand Distinguished Guests,It is a privilege and an honor to be invited at the United Nations to delivera talk on 'Global Imbalances: an Indian Perspective". I would like to thankProfessor Jose Antonio Ocampo, Under Secretary General, for inviting me todeliver this talk.  In my presentation today, I hope to capture the debate amongthe policy makers as well as academics; though I must be humble in thepresence of Mr. Ocampo who has been a Minister, and a Professor and currentlyinternational civil servant of eminence. To benefit from the discussions that areexpected to follow, I will restrict my presentation to about 30 to 40 minutes.First, I would like to reflect upon the international perspective on globalimbalances by raising three issues: (a) the essential features of the globalimbalances as they stand today, (b) possible causes of these imbalances, and(c) the emerging consensus on policy responses.Second, I will attempt to highlight India’s perspective on the globalimbalances. While doing so, I would try to cover the following aspects: (a) India’srole in global imbalances, (b) approach to global consensus on causes and policyresponses, (c) possible impact of global imbalances on India, and (d) theemergence of oil as a new factor in theThird, I shall explore a possible agenda for analysis to enable betterunderstanding of global imbalances.I. Global Perspective on Global Imbalances(a)  Essential Feature of the Global ImbalancesIt is useful to understand that in different countries the existence of acurrent account surplus or deficit is inevitable among economies at any giventime.  In particular, one of the arguments in favor of global integration is that                                                1 Key Note Address by Dr.Y.V.Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at The Financing forDevelopment (FFD) Office, Department of Economic and Social Office (DESA), United Nations, NewYork on May 11, 2006.capital may flow from developed economies to the capital starved developingeconomies which implies that there would be current account deficits in the latter.The problem is not the existence of current account deficits or surpluses per se,but it is persistence of large current account deficit and large current accountsurplus, particularly in large and systemically important economies, which giverise to fears of unsustainabilty and disruptive unwinding.(b) Possible Causes of Global ImbalancesThe current global imbalance is reflected in large mismatches in thecurrent account positions in some countries and its mirror image in the form ofdomestic saving-investment mismatches. For instance, the US current accountdeficit was 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2005 and stood at US $ 805 billion. While thecurrent account surplus of Japan and emerging Asia accounted for about 60 percent of the current account deficit of the US. Now, with rising oil prices, the oilexporting countries also exhibit large current account surpluses. It is argued by some that since the late 1990s, the growth processes inmany emerging market economies (EMEs), especially those from Asia, havecome to rely heavily on external demand. Under such a scenario, it has been felt,many of these countries tried to maintain their external price competitiveness bykeeping their currencies undervalued. The process, it is stated, in turn, led tolarge trade and current account surplus for the Asian EMEs and large trade andcurrent deficits elsewhere in the world, most noticeably in the US.It is also clear that the sharp deterioration in the saving-investmentbalance in the US in the recent years along with sustained rise in consumptiondemand, could only be met by rising imports; hence rising large current accountdeficits in the US. The adverse shift in saving-investment balance in the US isreflected both in the high budget deficit since 2002 and the deterioration in netpersonal saving since 1998.(c) The Emerging Consensus on Policy Responses.The global imbalance as it stands today may get corrected on its own andperhaps there could be chances of a less favorable outcome of disorderly2correction. It is held that one scenario could be that an orderly private sector ledadjustment in imbalances could materialize even without policy action. It isargued that, however slim the chances of a disorderly adjustment, in view ofhuge cost of disorderly adjustments, public policy cannot afford but strive forrelatively orderly adjustment. In any case, it is felt that there is a need for betterunderstanding of policy issues with a view to take appropriate policy actions asalso to minimize the cost of adjustments if it were to take place in not very orderlyfashion.We have viewed, like many others here, that the sustained and increasingimbalances in the current account positions across the globe could entail seriousrisks for the functioning of the international monetary system. Rebalancing is bestseen as a process with many moving parts that involve all the major actors in theglobal economy. The successful execution of rebalancing will require a carefulapplication of traditional macro policies — monetary, fiscal, and currency policies— as well as implementation of comprehensive micro agenda of structuralreforms.A significant part of the debate seems to be on relative weights to beaccorded by each country to the various elements of the package and theaspects of coordination among the countries that are appropriate.  As regards thecurrent global initiatives to correct global imbalances, the Communiqué issued bythe International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) released on April 22,2006 highlights that action for orderly medium-term resolution of globalimbalances is a shared responsibility, and will bring greater benefit to membersand the international community than actions taken individually by countries. Keyelements of the strategy towards orderly resolution of the global imbalancesuggested in the Communiqué are as follows:• Raising national saving in the United States—with measures toreduce the budget deficit and spur private saving;• implementing structural reforms to sustain growth potential andboost domestic demand in the euro area and several othercountries;•  further structural reforms, including fiscal consolidation, in Japan;3• allowing greater exchange rate flexibility in a number of surpluscountries in emerging Asia; and• promoting efficient absorption of higher oil revenues in oil-exportingcountries with strong macroeconomic policies.In the light of the above, the adjustments that are generally advocated inthe individual economies and regions may be summarized as follows:(i) A major challenge for US authorities could be to seek policies that balancebetween measures to boost personal saving coupled with measures to cutconsumption. However, US policies would need to delicately balance agradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus without hurting the recovery. It shouldbe noted that demand compression could result in another recession,which would not be in the interest of the global economy. A gradualrealignment of the real exchange rate of the US dollar coupled withmeasures targeted towards fiscal consolidation is generally advocated.Having said that, proper calibration would hold the key to the success ofsuch a policy mix and this is an important public policy issue.(ii) The Euro area, which continues to depend largely on external demand,could pursue some structural reforms, especially product and labor marketpolicies, to boost domestic demand and broad-base the recovery. Whilethere are signs of recovery in investment, it is recognized by many thatfurther progress would be helpful to foster better integration of labor,health care, product, pension and financial market reforms. It isrecognized that structural reforms by their nature are complex and theirimpact at best could be only over the medium term.(iii) We are already witnessing that the Japanese economy is on the way torecovery; the current account surplus has begun to narrow against thebackground of strengthening domestic demand, which is critical. Thus, theJapanese economy is expected to continue to take some concretemeasures to strengthen its financial system, restructure the corporatesector, and reduce large fiscal imbalances.(iv) As for the emerging economies, especially in Asia, some experts suggestthat the growth strategy could be reoriented towards domestic demand tooffset possible declines in exports to the US. There are already somesigns of strengthening in domestic demand in this region. It is felt thatimprovement in the investment climate to support higher privateinvestment in the emerging economies is important. It is argued by somethat the exchange rate policy may require some attention of the policymakers in the region. However, some others consider that exchange rateadjustments may not serve the interests of output and employment inthese countries, while effectiveness of such exchange rate adjustments bythemselves in unwinding the imbalances is not conclusive.4(v)  The oil exporting countries have recorded large trade surpluses, theinvestment of which in the domestic market and abroad would helprebalancing global demand. It is suggested that these countries couldboost expenditures to some extent in areas where social returns are highlike education, health, infrastructure and social security. It is felt thatstructural policies to strengthen legal and economic infrastructure in thesecountries may help promoting investment. However, it is also argued thatin many oil exporting countries scope for domestic absorption is limited inthe short run.II. India’s Perspective on Global Imbalances(a) India’s Role in Global ImbalancesSince Independence, India has moved from a moderate growth path of thefirst three decades (1950 to 1980) to a higher growth trajectory since the 1980s.Over the last two and a half decades, India has emerged as one of the fastestgrowing economies of the world, averaging about 6 per cent growth rate perannum and the ranking of the country in terms of size of the economy, especiallyin purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, has improved. In the last three years, wehave averaged a growth rate of 8 per cent. Apart from registering impressivegrowth rate over the last two and a half decades, India’s growth process hasbeen stable. Studies indicate that the yearly variation in growth in India has beenone of the lowest. During this period, we have faced only one crisis in 1991. Thecrisis was followed by a credible macroeconomic structural and stabilizationprogramme encompassing trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate,public finance and the financial sector. The Indian economy in later years, couldsuccessfully avoid any adverse contagion impact of shocks from the East Asiancrisis, the Russian crisis during 1997-98, sanction like situation in post-Pokhranscenario, and border conflict during May-June 1999. In this context, it is appropriate to view the evidence that the policiesfollowed by India have not in any way contributed to the widening of the currentglobal imbalances:5(i) Between 2001-02 and 2003-04, India registered modest currentaccount surpluses, but this was more of a reflection of phase ofbusiness cycle, and with the turn around in the business cycle, Indiahas registered a modest current account deficit in the last two years. Infact, going by the current indication and the projections of the tenthFive Year Plan, India is likely to maintain a modest and sustainablecurrent account  deficit in the near future.(ii) It is observed that generally current account surplus accounted for aconsiderable proportion of reserve accumulation in most of the AsianEMEs and Japan during 2000-05. For India, current account surplushas been a minor source of reserve accretion. In our case, capitalflows, as opposed to current account surpluses, played an increasinglyimportant role in the accumulation of reserves.(iii) Our approach aimed at market determined exchange rate with nopredetermined target along with market interventions essentially tomanage volatility has served us well. At the empirical level, theflexibility of Indian exchange rate policy is captured by marked two-waymovement of Indian rupee against the major currencies including USdollar. Recent international research on viable exchange ratestrategies in emerging markets has lent considerable support to theexchange rate policy followed by India.(iv) The main driver of growth in India has been domestic demand.Impressive growth in exports and imports does strengthen theeconomy but the ratio of exports to GDP in India is lower than mostEMEs.(v) The overall improvement in GDP growth during the reform period hasalso been facilitated by improvement in the rate of aggregate domesticsaving. For instance, in the high growth phase of last three years, thesaving rate rose by 5.5 percentage points from 23.5 per cent in 2001-02 to 29.1 per cent in 2004-05. Gross domestic investment rate, for thefirst time, remained above 30 per cent in 2004-05, mainly on accountof private investment growing at 19.7 per cent. With the FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management Act in place, the fiscalsituation in India has shown improvement in the recent years. Thefiscal consolidation process envisages phased reduction in the keydeficit indicators.  Monetary policy, while being supportive ofinvestment demand places emphasis on price and financial stabilityand has succeeded in containing inflation expectations. These factorsgive confidence to the possibility of sustaining the present growthmomentum – GDP growth of close to 8 per cent per annum.6India has, thus, been following policies which not only served it well butalso contributed to global stability. As mentioned by our Finance Minister, Mr. P.Chidambaram, we do not expect any change in the basic framework of ourpolicies both in terms of growth based on efficient use of capital and stabilityassured by sound macroeconomic policies.(b) Approach to Global Consensus on Causes and Policy ResponsesWe view that global developments, particularly those in the world financialmarkets, have the most direct and serious impact on the financing conditions inthe emerging markets. Any abrupt and disorderly adjustment to globalimbalances may have serious adverse implications. Recognising thesedevelopments, Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh in his welcomeaddress to the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at theth39 Annual General Meeting in Hyderabad, a couple of weeks ago, highlightedthe importance of correcting these imbalances. I quote  from his address:“While to some extent mismatches in current account positions are to beexpected - and even desirable - in the global economy, large disparitiesraise concerns about unsustainability and hard landings. The process ofcorrecting imbalances can be disruptive if it is sudden and unexpected.The present level of global imbalance cannot be sustained forever. It callsfor action both from countries having current account surpluses and thosehaving current account deficits. A coordinated effort is necessary tocorrect the imbalances to prevent a sudden down turn. Internationalfinancial institutions need to play a proactive role in this regard”.During the same Annual Meeting of the ADB in Hyderabad our FinanceMinister Mr. P. Chidambaram while dwelling at length on the issue of globalimbalances highlighted that we have to address the global imbalance in such amanner so that the benefits of global integration continue in an uninterruptedfashion. He pointed out that Asia has an important role to play in conjunction withother countries in the process of unwinding of global imbalance. I quote from hisaddress:“I must reiterate that to sustain the recovery process and to correct theglobal imbalances in an orderly manner, there is an imperative need for acooperative approach.”7We had raised the issue of global imbalances in the Reserve Bank ofIndia’s Annual Report of the 2002-03 realizing at that time that this problem hasthe potential to occupy the attention of the global economies in future. TheReport observed:“Although growing imbalances may seem to be an integral feature ofglobalization, there are nonetheless limits to the accumulation of netclaims against an economy that are implied by persistent current accountdeficits. The cost of servicing such claims adds to the current accountdeficit and, under certain circumstances, can be destabilizing”The apprehensions expressed, in retrospect, proved to be warranted. At this juncture, it is appropriate to list some important considerations thatshould govern initiatives in regard to resolution of global imbalances recognizingthat such policy initiatives may be broadly in consonance with emergingconsensus described earlier in the address.First, it is necessary for multilateral institutions like IMF to be seen assymmetrical in their analysis of national economies and their relative positions inthe global economy.  This would add credibility to the policy advice that could beconsidered by each country.Second, at the same time, action by each country will be governed byenlightened national interest. It is necessary for multilateral institutions toanalyze, explore and convince how the policy actions would serve the long termnational interest.Third, it is desirable to convince the policy makers in each country thatactions considered appropriate are in the long term interest of the country itself.In this regard, the contextual challenges for each economy should be given dueweight.  For example, in countries like India, employment and poverty reductionneed to be given highest priority.Fourth, it is essential to recognize that co-ordination is necessary giventhe complex situation where neither the causes nor the solutions are clear-cut.As a first step, there could, however, be a broad agreement on the directions andthe first principles that are most appropriate.  Emphasis on harmony in policiesand search for co-operative solutions appears appropriate.8 (c) Possible Impact of Global Imbalances on IndiaAs highlighted by our Finance Minister during the recent ADB annualmeetings that apart from the impact on the real and external sectors, it is felt thatthe developments in the currency and capital market are intrinsically intertwinedwith the global imbalance and, therefore, in the eventuality of a disorderlycorrection, disruption in these markets in the form of large cross-currencyvolatility and sharp rise in interest rates are likely in the global economy. Whatcould be the possible impact of less than orderly adjustment of global imbalanceson the Indian economy?India does not depend on the international capital market for financing thefiscal deficit and consequently to some extent adverse consequences of theglobal developments would be muted. However, there could be a spill-over effectof global developments on domestic interest rates and thus on fisc also. Thefiscal position of the Government could also be indirectly impacted through thenature of management of foreign exchange reserves held by the Reserve Bank.Similarly, any abrupt adjustment in global imbalances may affectcorporates, banks and households in India though the impact may be less thansome other emerging economies.With respect to the impact on corporates, if there is widening of spreadsdue to a shift in investor confidence in the international markets, those corporateswhich have borrowed at variable rates may possibly suffer more than those,which have taken loans on a fixed rate basis. Corporates which have hedgedagainst currency and interest rate risks may escape the adverse effects. It maybe noted that the Reserve Bank has been urging banks to encourage corporatesto hedge their foreign currency exposures. Further, exposure of the corporatesector as a whole to the external debt is limited by indicative ceilings on externalcommercial borrowings imposed by the Government and the Reserve Bank ofIndia. The level of total external debt of India is currently less than the foreignexchange reserves.9 Although banks in India have their deposit base predominately in rupeesand their investment in foreign currency assets is not large, they have beenfinancing investment in assets, home loans and the retail market as well asequities. Like in many EMEs, asset prices have risen sharply in India too. Shouldthere be a reversal of capital flows, asset prices may decline but the banksexposure to the risky assets have been severely restricted by Reserve Bank’sregulatory actions. Likewise, the equity market has also seen a sustaineduptrend but efforts have been made by the Reserve Bank to cap the banks’exposures.  Further, banks in India have invested significantly in governmentdebt and other fixed income securities. If a rise in international rates getsreflected in domestic interest rates, banks will have to mark down the value oftheir investment portfolio. To the extent a rise in international interest ratesimpacts the domestic interest rates, it would entail marked-to-market losses onthe investment portfolios. However, the banking sector has acquired some addedstrength to absorb such probable shocks, largely aided by regulatory actions. As regards impact on the households, there is a risk that rises in interestrates in general could impact the housing market and expose the balance sheetof the households to interest rate risk, increasing the risk of loan losses forbanks. The overall banking sector’s exposure to housing loans being relativelysmall, adverse developments may not have any systemic implications on thebanking sector.(d) The Emergence of Oil as a New FactorThe emergence of large current account surpluses among the oilexporting countries is an important recent development. The current accountsurplus of the oil exporting countries increased from 6.2 per cent of their GDP in2001 to 19.1 per cent in 2005. Less than third of the combined current accountsurplus of the oil exporting countries has been reflected in their foreign exchangereserves which rose by US $ 90 billion in 2005. The IMF (World EconomicOutlook, April 2006) has highlighted that to the extent that higher net savings byoil exporters have driven down global interest rates, and that these lower rateshave boosted demand in economies with market based financial systems, such10as the United States, the oil price shock may also have had an additionalnegative effect on the US external position.The fact remains that the rising oil prices would result in further wideningof global current account imbalances as according to consensus forecast thecurrent account balance of the US is projected to deteriorate further in 2006.Other industrialized economies are projected to run a combined surplus ledmainly by Japan and Germany. The aggregate current account surplus of themajor oil  exporting countries is expected to increase further in the near term.  In this regard, it may be noted that India’s oil import bill amounted to 2.9per cent of GDP in 2001-02, but the bill climbed to 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2005-06, though in volume terms the increase has been marginal.III.  Agenda for AnalysisIn view of complex nature of global imbalances and the way forward tominimize the risks of disorderly adjustments, it may be useful to explore possibleagenda for further analysis.First, national balance sheets, as mentioned by Governor Mervyn King,could be given special attention to get a fuller picture of financial claims thatcountries have against other countries. Looking at the national balance sheetswould also be useful to acquire a sense about the potential for adjustment, andthey will give a sense of the possible impact of relative price changes on thevalue of assets and liabilities. The composition and size of the liabilities andassets of the national balance sheets are crucial as by viewing them together wecould get a global picture. However, we should look deeper into the balancesheets in terms of disaggregating them into public and private sector componentsand the incomes generated in the process. A relevant observation here is theperceived higher returns to external assets held by US relative to US assets heldby the rest of the world. A disaggregation enables  analysis of the role of privateand public sector in perpetuation as well as the resolution of imbalances. Therecould be dominance of bilateral claims of the private sector of one country to thepublic or the private sector of other country. Could such dominant bilateral claimsbecome a noticeable force allowing, at times, non-economic factors to play a rolein the whole process of engagement?11Second, following the experience of the East Asian crisis of 1997-98,where private sector vulnerabilities rather than public sector imbalances played akey role in precipitating the crisis, the third generation models have explicitlybrought to the fore the role of balance sheet mismatches in causing financialcrises. A country’s balance sheet as evident from traditional macroeconomicaggregate could be quite sound, yet, analysis of composition and size of theliabilities and assets of the balance sheets of domestic entities may be useful inassessing vulnerability to the manner of unwinding of imbalances. It wouldtherefore be useful to analyze the impact of global imbalances on variousbalance sheets within the country such as the government sector, financial sectorincluding banks and financial institutions, non-financial private sector includingcorporates and households.Third, as mentioned earlier, surplus of oil exporting countries has emergedas a new factor in the debate on the global imbalance.  There are someindications that the oil surpluses are being deployed in more diversified avenuesthan official reserves. Oil exporters appear to have taken advantage of emerginginvestment opportunity in stock markets and real estate. Such inflows could havehelped to keep long-term interest rates as also emerging market bond spreadslow, even as policy rates are rising. An interesting issue would be the nature oftheir responses to unwinding of global imbalances.Fourth, in a way global imbalance is a reflection of incompleteglobalization. If there were complete globalization, the surplus in saving of onecountry could be utilized by a country which has deficit in saving as it happensamong different States in India or the US. It could be argued that as the globaleconomy integrates further, the resolution of the global imbalances might besmoother.Fifth, what is the evolving role of viewing exchange rate regimes ininfluencing domestic economy? It is argued by some that the emerging evidenceindicates that domestic price movements remain somewhat immune toconsiderable exchange rate movements. If so, the possibility of bringing aboutglobal rebalancing through exchange rate adjustment by itself may not be veryencouraging. No doubt exchange rate would have an important role to play in12global rebalancing, but the issue is its relationship with other components of thewhole package like saving–investment, fiscal deficit, raising investment,structural reforms and domestic output as well as employment. The linkagesamong the various components described here could be very country specific.Sixth, there is wide diversity among the Asian economies in terms ofsaving and investment rates, fiscal deficit, drivers of growth (domestic versusexternal demand) and the degree of flexibility in their exchange rates. Thus, itmay be difficult to treat all of them as contributing to global financial imbalances,in the same manner, nor would all the Asian economies be identically affected bythe adjustment of global financial imbalances. Correspondingly, the policyresponse of each country to the issue would be tailored to the circumstances.More importantly, with growing integration among Asian economies, how wouldthe process of rebalancing affect them depending on the manner in whichdominant economies in Asia manage the process?Seventh, our Prime Minister, Professor Manmohan Singh has suggestedthat given the potential for investment demand in the region, we must find waysof making better use of savings and finding investment avenues within theregion. In this regard, an important issue would be generation of demand withinthe region so that the aggregate current account surpluses are absorbed in theregion itself. This process of demand generation would help in orderly correctionof the global imbalancesEighth, one wonders whether there is a dissonance between theperception of financial markets and that of the policy makers in regard to globalimbalances. The policy makers appear to give some signals of concern, but theresponse of the financial markets is often out of alignment with the signals.Interestingly, anecdotal evidence shows that analysts in financial intermediariesare sensitive to the downside risk of imbalances, but the conduct of theparticipants does not reflect the awareness. No doubt, this sense of dissonanceis not new, as for example, stock markets went up after Mr. Alan Greenspan’sstatement regarding irrational exuberance. If such dissonance is true, andpersists, what would be the effectiveness of public policy initiatives?13Ninth, is there an advantage in assessing the non-quantifiable factors toexplain the persistence of what has been stated as a stable disequilibrium todescribe the current status of the global economy?  For example, signature valueof United States in terms of confidence of financial markets as a lasting safe-haven status could be a factor, though the issue is whether it will be validinterminably. The perception of continuing productivity gains in the US due to itsproven flexibilities could be another. Lack of alternatives to deploy globalsavings, which are expanding may also be relevant. No doubt, these are notquantifiable, but do not cease to be relevant for analysis and assessment.Finally, is it possible that there are several intermediate scenariosbetween orderly adjustments and disruptive or disorderly adjustments? A seriesof marginal adjustments, often in spurts, could take place which may appearrandom, but move towards gradual lessening of imbalances through aninteractive and iterative processes encompassing markets, national policies andglobal cooperation. The agenda for analysis proposed here may facilitateexploration of such intermediate scenarios of unwinding global imbalances.IV. ConclusionTo conclude, the performance of the Indian economy since 1980, and inparticular since the reforms in the 1990s, is in many ways an impressive successstory both in terms of growth and stability. The Indian economy has respondedwell to the rising global competition with gradually increasing integration with theworld economy. The current high growth phase of the Indian economy is alsocoinciding with rising domestic saving rates. While India by itself hardlycontributes to the current global financial imbalances, any large and rapidadjustments in major currencies and related interest rates or current accounts oftrading partners could indirectly, but significantly, impact the Indian economy. Wetherefore have a large stake in the process of unwinding of global imbalances,and we are willing to play our part in ensuring successful outcomes from currentinitiatives.Thank you14
