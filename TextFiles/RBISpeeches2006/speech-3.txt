URBAN COOPERATIVE BANKS -
Evolution of the banks, current issues in Corporate Governance and
*
 challenges in their Regulation and Supervision 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy and honoured to be here today to deliver the “Late Shri. R. N.
Godbole memorial lecture” this year. My thanks to the Shivaji University,
Kolhapur for extending me the invitation to deliver this lecture
I have chosen to speak today on Urban Cooperative Banks - a key sector
in the Indian Banking scene, which in the recent years has gone through a lot of
turmoil. While the ordeal is not as yet over for some banks, the sector on the
whole is showing signs of looking up. It is encouraging to note that the Reserve
Bank’s initiatives towards the revival of this sector – a unique sector blending
banking and cooperation – are bearing fruit. Talking of cooperation, one cannot
but recollect the glory of this wonderful district that we are in today – Kolhapur, a
leading district in the cooperative movement in Maharashtra, famous for its
cooperatives.
Indeed, it is a good time and place to have a detailed discussion on the
evolution of the UCBs, governance issues observed in them and the challenges
in the regulation and supervision of the sector.
I would like to begin with a brief note on the historical perspective on
cooperative movement in India and the origin of UCBs, and then move on to the
current issues.
Historical perspective
The cooperative movement in India started a century ago with the
enactment of Cooperative Societies Act in 1904. Interestingly, legal status was
conferred on credit societies keeping in view, in particular, the needs of the
agricultural sector. Nevertheless, Sir Ibbetson, who piloted the legislation

Late Shri R.N.Godbole Memorial Lecture (2006) delivered by Smt. Usha Thorat, Deputy
Governor, Reserve Bank of India on December 6, 2006 at Shivaji University, Kolhapur2
observed: “We recognize that artisans, employees on small pay and other
persons in towns may very properly be admitted to the benefits of our legislation”.
Although joint stock banks opened branches in urban and semi-urban
areas, they did not find it advantageous to cater to the banking and credit
requirements of the urban middle/lower class comprising small traders/
businessmen, artisans, factory workers, salaried persons with limited incomes
etc. The inability of joint stock banks to appreciate and cater to the needs of this
class of clientele with limited means effectively drove them to money-lenders and
similar agencies for loans at exorbitant rates of interest - this situation was the
prime mover for non-agricultural credit cooperatives coming into being in India.
The main objectives of such cooperatives were to meet the banking and credit
requirements of this section of people and to protect them from exploitation.
Thus, urban cooperative banks’ emergence was a result of local response to an
enabling legislative environment, unlike rural cooperative movement that was
largely State-driven. The origin of cooperative banks can be traced to a small
town in South India, called Conjivaram, where in 1904, the Conjivaram Urban
Cooperative Bank was set up, to cater to the needs of small businessmen as an
alternative to moneylenders.
Little attention had been paid to the development of the urban credit
movement until the Maclagan Committee (1914) drew attention to its potentials.
Interestingly, a banking crisis in India in 1913-14, when no fewer than 57 joint
stock banks collapsed, led to a flight of deposits from joint stock banks to urban
cooperative banks. The Maclagan Committee investigating the crisis stated ‘As a
matter of fact, the crisis had a contrary effect and in most provinces there was a
movement to withdraw deposits from non cooperatives and place them in
cooperative institutions, the distinction between the two classes of security being
well appreciated and preference being given to latter owing partly to the local
character and publicity of cooperative institutions but mainly we think, to the
connection of Government with the cooperative movement’.3
Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)
Urban cooperative banks, also referred to as primary co-operative banks,
play an important role in meeting the growing credit needs of urban and semi-
urban areas of the country. They mobilise savings from the middle and lower
income groups and purvey credit to small borrowers, including weaker sections of
the society. These banks in India are financial cooperatives akin to credit unions
found abroad, except that they can also accept deposits from non-members and
form a part of the payments systems.
Market share of UCBs
As on March 31, 2006 there were 1853 UCBs, 84 scheduled commercial
banks, 133 Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and 398 Rural Cooperative Banks
(including 31 State Cooperative Banks and 367 District Cooperative Banks) in
India. An analysis of market share of various bank groups indicates that the share
of UCBs in total bank deposits is relatively low. Nevertheless, their market share
grew steadily from 3.3% in 1990-91 to a high of 6.6% in 1999-2000, but thereafter
gradually declined to 4.8% (provisional) in 2005-06, as shown in the following
Table.

Growth of UCBs4
In 1966 when the Banking Regulation Act was made applicable to UCBs,
there were about 1100 UCBs with deposits and advances of Rs.167 crore and
Rs.153 crore respectively. As at the end of 1996, the number of UCBs increased
to 1501 and their deposits and advances rose significantly to Rs.24,161 crore
and Rs.17,927 crore. The UCBs continued to grow at a fast pace till 2003, when
their number increased to 1941 and their deposits and advances to Rs.1,01,546
crore and Rs.64,880 crore respectively. Subsequently, the number of UCBs
declined in 2006 to 1853 with total deposits of Rs.1,12,237 crore and advances of
Rs.70,379 crore. An overview of their growth since the 1990s is given in Table 2
below.

The spectacular growth of UCBs in the late nineties and up to 2003, which
had resulted in increasing their penetration, ironically, also led to certain
weaknesses in the sector that adversely affected public perception and thereby,
their competitiveness. A major reason for the decline in public confidence was the
crisis faced in 2001 by a large multi-state bank in the state of Gujarat, when the
bank witnessed a sudden ‘run’ on its branches, following rumours of its large
exposure to a leading broker who had suffered huge losses in the share market.
The large-scale withdrawal of deposits within short time had resulted in severe
liquidity problems for the bank. The bank was also holding about Rs.800 crore of
inter-bank deposits from a large number of UCBs in the State and from other
States, which posed a systemic risk. In order to protect the interests of the
general public and also that of the other co-operative banks, RBI had issued5
directions to the bank restricting certain operations (acceptance of fresh deposits,
restricting payments to any single depositor to Rs.1000 and ban on fresh lending)
and requisitioned the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies, New Delhi to
supersede the Board of Directors and appoint an Administrator. An order of
moratorium was also enforced on the bank by the Central Government for a short
period. The bank was subsequently placed under a scheme of reconstruction
with the approval of Reserve Bank of India.
The Gujarat episode was followed by another major crisis in the state of
Andhra Pradesh in 2002, when one of the largest banks in the state faced a run,
following a newspaper report regarding an inquiry instituted into the affairs of the
bank by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The bank was in a weak
position, and ultimately, after attempts for its revival failed, its license was
cancelled by the Reserve Bank in 2004.
The decline is public confidence in the UCB sector deepened in the
aftermath of the crisis in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh and concomitantly, the
position of UCBs generally deteriorated. As on June 30, 2004, 732 out of 1919
UCBs were categorised in Grade III or IV signifying weakness and sickness.
Recognising the systemic risks and keeping in view the needs of its clientele,
Reserve Bank reviewed the entire gamut of legislative, regulatory and
supervisory framework for these banks, and in March 2005, brought out a draft
‘Vision Document for UCBs’. The vision document, which was drawn with the
main objective of maintaining the viability and competitiveness of the UCBs,
discussed the characteristics of the sector, analysed the problems afflicting the
banks and proposed strategies for dealing with problems affecting the sector.
I would first dwell upon the salient features of the UCB sector and,
thereafter, elaborate on the vision document and other initiatives of the Reserve
Bank for ensuring viability and competitiveness of the banks in this sector.6
Salient features of the UCB sector
The UCB sector is unique in that there is significant degree of
heterogeneity among the banks in this sector in terms of size, geographical
distribution, performance and financial strength. There is also diversity among the
urban cooperative banks in the levels of professionalism, standards of corporate
governance and access to advanced technology. Most importantly, the banks in
this sector are under dual control, with a part of the powers vested in the State
Government and a part with Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank is, therefore,
continuously evolving the regulatory and supervisory framework for UCBs to
ensure their soundness without sacrificing their competitiveness. But before,
stepping into the realm of regulation/ supervision, I would like to elaborate further
on the aspect of heterogeneity of UCBs, which would help in better
understanding of the sector.
Heterogeneity
 While on the one hand, there are a number of small neighbourhood banks
functioning for mutual interest of their members, on the other, there are several
large UCBs with a wide network of branches, large number of depositors and
borrowers, many of whom are medium/large corporates. In the latter kind of
UCBs, the cooperative structure remains only as an organizational arrangement
and their business model and goals are more akin to commercial banks. The
extent of heterogeneity can be gauged by size-wise, region-wise and grading-
wise analysis of the UCBs.
Size-wise distribution
The frequency distribution of UCBs in terms of deposits and advances
their relative share is shown in Table 3. It is observed that at the lower end of the
spectrum, 36.2% of the UCBs have a deposit base of less than Rs.10 crore and
account for only 3.0% of deposits. At the same time, at the top end, only 14
banks had a share of 23% in the total deposits. More than 50% of the UCBs (9627
banks) fell in the deposit base range of Rs.10 crore to Rs.100 crore and
accounted for 29.5% of total deposits.

Region- wise distribution
The distribution of urban cooperative banks across the country is skewed,
with significant concentration in southern and western regions. Table 4 gives the
region-wise distribution of number of UCBs and share of deposits of each region.

*Provisional Data submitted by banks
Grade-wise distribution
As part of its on-site inspection exercise, Reserve Bank has a system of
categorizing banks into four grades based on objective parameters relating to
capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, compliance with CRR/SLR8
requirements and adherence to RBI guidelines and/ directives. While Grade I
covers banks with no major supervisory concerns, the other three grades would
indicate existence of supervisory concerns in increasing degree.  Table 5 gives
the grading-wise distribution of banks as on March 31, 2006 (as per provisional
data). It is seen that 37% of UCBs in the country, accounting for 25.60% of total
deposits, were in Grades-III and IV signifying weakness/and sickness, while the
remaining major portion (63%) of UCBs, accounting for 74.40% of total deposits,
were in Grades-I and II, indicating good/satisfactory performance/ financials

Dual Control
Urban co-operative banks are regulated and supervised by both, the State
Governments, through the Registrars of Co-operative Societies, and by the
Reserve Bank of India. The Registrars exercise powers in regard to
incorporation, registration, management, amalgamation, reconstruction or
liquidation. In case of banks having presence in more than one state, the Central
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, on behalf of the Central Government,
exercises such powers. The banking related functions such as issue of license to
start new banks or branches, matters relating to interest rates, policies on loans
and investments, prudential norms etc. are regulated and supervised by the
Reserve Bank of India. Duality of command is not unique to India, and requires
delicate coordination for obtaining synergies in regulatory and supervisory
functions.
Competition and UCBs9
Market scenario
Since 1991, the financial system has seen several reforms. The process of
liberalization was set in motion with gradual removal of restrictions on the
operation of the pricing mechanism, especially interest rates and statutory
liquidity and reserve requirements – a process which is still underway. Enhanced
competition in both banking and non-banking financial sectors has been gradually
introduced – through a dynamic mix of public and private as well as domestic and
foreign ownership – along with deregulation or adaptive regulations.
Simultaneously, regulation and supervision of banks, financial markets and
infrastructure were improved to increasingly align them with international
standards and best practices. The market driven economy, through deployment
of more capital, advanced technology and skilled human resources, is posing stiff
and increasing competition to all traditional institutions.
UCBs position
Market competition and the need to retain good clientele are affecting the
UCBs too leading to squeezing of the margins on many banks, especially the
larger ones. The larger private sector commercial banks, with their ability to
invest more in technology and offer better remuneration to attract skilled persons,
are better off in fending competition. Understandably, therefore, the UCBs that
are competing in the same space, especially in cities and towns, are also being
aggressively targeted by the commercial banks and face tough competition. The
smaller unit banks on the other hand, by and large, manage to retain their niche
role through personalized service and informal approach.
Corporate Governance issues in UCBs
Most of the problems faced by the UCBs are due to governance issues
and connected lending. In UCBs borrowers have a significant say in the
managements of the banks. This has the potential of influencing the Boards to
take decisions that may not always be in the interest of the depositors who
constitute the most important stakeholders of a bank. Also, unlike the case of10
institutions the shares of which can be listed in a stock exchange and can change
hands without affecting the capital base, in case of UCBs, the shareholders can
withdraw their contribution to capital and shrink the capital of the bank and
thereby limit its ability to increase risk weighted assets and expand business.
On this crucial aspect of corporate governance, I would like to, therefore,
discuss a little about the international best practices.
Corporate Governance – international best practices for credit unions
As best practices guide, the World Council of Credit Unions has
1
enunciated ideal governance principles for credit unions , which are financial
cooperatives similar to our urban cooperative banks. These principles address
the challenges of organizational power within credit unions at three separate
levels viz. External Governance, Internal Governance and Individual Governance.
External Governance
All financial institutions, regardless of type, are expected to comply with
the following basic standards of transparency, auditing and financial reporting.
Transparency
• The board should commit to regular, honest communication of its activities
with members, regulators and the general public in the spirit of full
disclosure.
• Financial statements, compliant with generally accepted accounting
principles and local regulatory standards, should be made available to
members and the public.
Compliance
• The board is expected to comply in both the letter and spirit of regulation,
to cooperate fully with its regulatory body and to comply with national laws.
• The board should ensure that the credit union meets or exceeds the
International Credit Union Safety and Soundness Principles as well as any
other relevant standards for financial institutions.11
• The credit union should undergo annual external audits within 90 days of
the end of each fiscal year.
• The audit relationship should be reexamined frequently and consideration
be given to changing the auditor at least every 3-5 years in a competitive
bidding process.
Public Accountability
• The board of directors and management must be constantly cognizant of
responsibilities to governmental structures, including but not limited to
regulators, legislative bodies, the media, the community and the public.
Internal Governance
Unlike for-profit entities, credit unions exist to serve their members. Thus,
credit unions must address this additional layer of governance related to their
democratic, member-driven nature. This includes a commitment to “one member,
one vote,” as well as adherence to the International Credit Union Operating
Principles and the role of the general assembly as the highest governing body.
Structure
• The board of directors should be composed of an odd number, no less
than five and no greater than nine.
• Consideration should be given to the rotation of directors.
• Interested general members who comply with the standards of individual
governance can stand for nomination.
• The board should encourage dialogue with general members at the annual
general meeting.
• The annual general meeting of the general assembly of members should
be adequately promoted to ensure sufficient member participation.
Continuity
• The board should create strategies to maintain the competitiveness and
sustainability of the credit union.12
• The board should create succession plans for both directors and
management that ensure the continued existence of the credit union.
• The board should approve a disaster management and recovery plan.
Balance
• The composition of the board should aim to adequately reflect the
demographic make up of its members and balance the financial service
demands of members.
• The board should seek to balance diversity and experience, but all
directors must meet the standards of individual governance.
Accountability
• The board is formally accountable to the general assembly of members,
which is the highest governing body.
• The roles and responsibilities of the board, committees and managers
should be established clearly in the bye-laws or other policies.
• It is the duty of the board to establish strategic direction, approve policies
and monitor management’s implementation of these policies and
achievement of targets.
• It is the duty of management to prepare the plan and budget, undertake
operations, implement the policies approved by the board and achieve the
targets set forth.
Individual Governance
In order to perform their collective duties, the individual board members
and managers have an obligation to maintain ethical conduct and professionalism
and to speak with a single voice once board decisions have been made. Board
members are also expected to possess the skills and technical capacity
necessary to fulfill their duties.13
Integrity
• The credit union should adopt a standardized code of conduct clearly
explaining proper behavior.
• Directors or managers must not have criminal backgrounds, recent
bankruptcies or penal backgrounds.
• Immediate family members should not serve on the board or in
management at the same time.
• Board members must excuse themselves from participating in discussions
and voting on matters from which they or their family have a potential
conflict of interest.
• The board must approve loans to directors or management. All such
insider loans must be made within the approved credit policy parameters
and will be reported on a regular basis to the full board.
• Directors with delinquent loans more than three months will be removed
from their position.
Competence
• All members of the board should have basic financial literacy, including the
ability to interpret financial statements and standards, or commit to
acquiring these skills through education or training within the first year of
service.
• Individual members should have specialized financial or business skills
and/or a member-focused viewpoint.
Commitment
• Directors should be willing and able to commit the necessary time to the
credit union. Failure to attend board meetings may result in dismissal.
• Directors must respect the decisions of the board, adhering to all policies
that have been adopted, regardless of personal opinion.
The board and managers, as a cohesive unit, would have to ensure the
credit union’s compliance with issues related to external and internal governance.14
In order to achieve this goal, each board member has a duty to adhere to the
principles of individual governance.
Competence of directors
In the context of urban cooperative banks in India, the first issue of
importance is whether there is collective expertise on the Board available to meet
the competitive challenges before the bank to ensure growth while maintaining
soundness? In today’s context, some of the areas where expertise at the Board
level is very useful is HR, IT and risk management. This enables the Board to get
unbiased advice from such members on the Board on managerial decisions and
on matters referred to the Board. Chairman and members of the Board should
ensure that the Board has a broad based talent in the Board in the areas of
accountancy and audit, IT, HR and other expertise and experience from industry,
trade and agriculture. Domain knowledge of the Board members enormously
increases the quality of governance and the Chairman should be able to tap this
talent to the advantage of the bank.
The other aspect relating to the composition of the Board relates to
‘fit and proper’ criteria for directors. Internationally, the best principles of
banking regulation require that regulators who give banks licenses ensure
banks are owned, controlled and managed by ‘fit and proper’ shareholders,
directors and senior managers. In most countries this is done through
ensuring that all significant shareholders fulfill the fit and proper tests, all
directors adhere to “fit and proper” criteria and appointments by the Board
of CEOs of banks and key functionaries like CFO, COO and the auditors
are approved by the regulator.
Role of bank directors
An important aspect of corporate governance is the role of directors. It
2
would be interesting to note that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has
spelt out the following principles that should guide the bank director:15
• Understand their oversight role and their fiduciary “duty of loyalty” and
“duty of care” to the bank and its shareholders;
•  Avoid conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts, in their activities
with, and commitments to, other organisations;
• Recuse themselves from decisions when they have conflicts of interest
that make them incapable of properly fulfilling their fiduciary duties;
• Are able to commit sufficient time and energy to fulfilling their
responsibilities;
• Are of a size that allows for efficiency and real strategic discussion;
• Continue to develop and maintain an appropriate level of collective
expertise as the bank grows in size and complexity;
• Periodically assess the effectiveness of their own governance practices,
including nomination and election of board members, determine where
weaknesses exist, and make changes as necessary;
• Select, monitor and, where necessary, replace key executives, while
ensuring that the bank has an appropriate plan for executive succession,
and determining that any intended successor(s) are qualified, fit and
proper to manage the affairs of the bank;
• Serve as a checks and balances function vis-à-vis the senior management
of the bank by exercising their duty and authority to question and insist
upon straight forward explanations from management, and receive on a
timely basis sufficient information to judge the performance of
management;
• Meet regularly with senior management and internal audit to establish and
approve policies, establish communication lines and monitor progress
toward corporate objectives;
• Promote bank safety and soundness, understand the regulatory
environment and ensure the bank maintains an effective relationship with
supervisors;
• Provide sound and objective advice, and recommend sound practices
gleaned from other situations;16
• Contribute special expertise in overseeing a bank’s activities which might
not be available in the rest of the parent or group;
• Do not participate as the board of directors in day-to-day management of
the bank;
• Exercise due diligence in the hiring and oversight of external auditors in
jurisdictions where this is the responsibility of the board (in some
jurisdictions, external auditors are hired directly by shareholders).
Policy initiatives of Reserve Bank of India
          Now, let us now take a look at various initiatives taken by the Reserve
Bank for stabilising and strengthening the Urban Cooperative Banks
Taking a view on the crisis faced by the sector time and again, the
Reserve Bank, in the annual policy for the year 2004-05, announced its decision
to stop granting fresh licenses for formation of new UCBs.  This was followed up
with a decision not to grant any fresh branch license as well.  It was made clear
that this was necessitated pending a comprehensive review of the legislative and
regulatory framework governing the sector. It was in this background that a
decision was taken to draft a vision document for the sector to outline a
framework that would facilitate the strengthening of the sector and enable it play
the assigned role of providing credit to the economically weaker sections.
Vision Document for UCBs
The Reserve Bank eventually formulated a draft vision document, placed it
in the public domain in March 2005 and finalised it thereafter, with the following
objectives:
(i) To rationalize the existing regulatory and supervisory approach keeping in
view the heterogeneous character of entities in the sector
(ii) To facilitate a focused and continuous system of supervision through
enhanced use of technology.17
(iii) To enhance professionalism and improve the quality of governance in
UCBs by providing training for skill up-gradation as also by including large
depositors in the decision making process / management of banks.
(iv) To put in place a mechanism that addresses the problems of dual control,
given the present legal framework, and the time consuming process in
bringing requisite legislative changes
(v) To put in place a consultative arrangement for identifying weak but
potentially viable entities in the sector and provide a framework for their
being nurtured back to health including, if necessary, through a process of
consolidation
(vi) To identify the unviable entities in the sector and provide an exit path for
such entities.
MOU with State Governments and constitution of TAFCUBs
In pursuance of the proposals in the draft vision document, state
governments having a large number of UCBs were approached for signing
memorandum of understanding (MOU). Some of these state governments have
since signed MOUs. The memorandum, in fact, provides the basis for the
constitution of Task Force for Urban Co-op. Banks (TAFCUB) in each State,
which is the forum for the consultative decision making process. The TAFCUB
has, apart from the representatives of the RBI and the State Government, those
of the UCBs sector as well. The MOU also provides for professionalising the audit
and the Reserve Bank's role in improving IT and HR levels in the UCBs.
The combined access to information from local and national level
federations of the banks, as also from the regulators and supervisors, has made
the TAFCUB effective instruments for consolidating the sector through quick and
non-disruptive exit of unviable entities and revival of the viable ones.
Recommendations of the TAFCUBs have the consent of all stakeholders
including Reserve Bank of India and, therefore, can be implemented speedily by18
all concerned. In states where TAFCUBs have not yet been constituted, pending
signing of MOU, the potentially viable and non-viable banks do not have the
benefit of coordinated deliberations on their future set-up, by both
regulators/supervisors. In such states, Reserve Bank directly initiates supervisory
action as per a graded supervisory action framework, which suggests specific
and objective course of action for the banks that are in different stages of
weakness. In keeping with the consultative process initiated with the state
governments, the Reserve Bank has sought to extend the arrangement to the
UCBs functioning in more than one state, through a MOU with the Central
Registrar and enlarging the scope of the TAFCUBs to cover the Scheduled
UCBs, which are systemically even more significant. Further, the consultative
approach is sought to be extended to the liquidation stage to facilitate early
lodging and settlement of insurance claims.
Arsing out of the comfort of coordinated supervision/regulation of banks in
the states that have signed the MOU, certain facilities have been extended to the
banks in such states. Requests from eligible banks in such states for additional
business opportunities, like setting up currency Chests, selling mutual funds,
providing forex services, opening of new ATMs etc. are also considered.
Strengthening of Regulatory/ Supervisory framework
The RBI recognized that there is a need to mitigate the risk to which the
system is exposed by providing a regulatory and supervisory framework that will
appropriately address the problems of the sector as also the shortcomings of dual
control. Significant features of the current regulatory/supervisory framework are
outlined below.
Dispensing with the one-size-fits-all approach
In order to achieve the objectives set out in the Vision document, Reserve
Bank of India is implementing a two-tiered regulatory and supervisory regime.
Banks with deposits under Rs.100 crore and whose operations are limited to a
single district, are considered to be more closely epitomizing the spirit of19
cooperative banking and as such are placed under simplified regulations to
enable them to gradually gain in strength, such that, over a period of 3 years they
can be brought at par with all other banks in term of performance, strength and
regulatory prescriptions.
As a step in this direction, recently Reserve Bank of India has allowed the
smaller banks to adopt 180 days delinquency norms for classification of assets as
non-performing, instead of the 90 days norm which is applicable for the larger
cooperative and all commercial banks in India. This is intended to provide a
measure of relief to the small UCBs and improve their financial performance
through lower Non Performing Advances requiring lower provisioning, which in
turn would translate into higher profits that could be used to shore up the capital
base of these banks. Incidentally, about a thousand UCBs stand to gain from
such differential regulatory regime.
Further, in view of the market risks associated with investments made in
Government securities, the smaller UCBs have been given exemption (upto 15
percent of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities) from the prescribed SLR of
25% required to be maintained in the form of government securities, to the extent
of funds placed in interest bearing deposits with the public sector banks. Another,
regulatory relaxation available to the small banks is in terms of provisioning
requirement for 'standard advances' which has recently been enhanced for UCBs
from 0.25% to 0.40%, but this enhancement has not been made applicable to
banks having deposits below Rs.100 crore and whose operations are confined to
a single district.
Supervision through enhanced use of technology
With regard to the mechanism for supervision, the smaller banks, which
are limited by their size and type of operations, pose lower systemic risks and
therefore it is envisaged that they would be supervised by a combination of
simplified off-site surveillance system of the RBI and on-site audit by the state
governments. The dependence on off-site surveillance and on-site supervision by
state agencies in respect of small (unit) banks, in addition to lowering the20
supervisory burden of the small entities, would also provide increased flexibility to
the RBI to deploy its supervisory resources to the larger and more risky banks.
Emphasis on corporate governance and professionalism
It is being increasingly highlighted that depositors are the most important
stakeholders in a bank and therefore inclusion of depositors as shareholders,
particularly the large depositors, is an agenda that is being actively pursued
independently as also through coordination with state governments. In order to
enhance professionalism, Reserve Bank insists on inclusion of at least two
professional directors on the board of each bank, which otherwise is essentially
an elected body comprising mainly of persons from the field of cooperation rather
than banking. In this direction, 'Fit and Proper' criteria for CEOs is also being
formulated for implementation through the state governments. Market discipline is
gradually being increased through rigorous disclosure norms and initiatives like
public disclosure of penal action taken against a bank by the RBI. Also in case of
gross violation of RBI guidelines / directives where complicity of a director or of
the Board is noticed, Reserve Bank of India approaches the Registrar of
Cooperatives of the concerned state for removing the director or even for
superceding the entire Board, depending upon the nature of violation. If
necessary, RBI also files police complaints for taking criminal action against
officials and directors of banks wherever criminal complicity is suspected by the
supervisory departments of the RBI. State Governments through the MOU, agree
to take immediate action on requisitions of RBI for super session of the Board of
Directors or for winding up a bank.
In order to ensure that 'arms length distance' is maintained between the
Board and the day-to-day operations of the bank, connected lending in terms of
loans to directors, and relatives of directors and to firms in which any director
may be 'interested', has been banned in India.  Further, as the quality of audit is
an important aspect of corporate governance, efforts have been made to ensure
that statutory audit of banks is conducted by professionals. As per the MOU, the
states agree to conduct statutory audit only through Chartered Accountants in21
respect of banks with deposits over Rs.25 crore, institute special audit by
Chartered Accountants at the behest of RBI and enhance the quality of statutory
audit by aligning their system of rating banks with that of Reserve Bank.
Consultative Approach to Regulation
In order to remain sensitive to developments in the marketplace as also for
ensuring better coordination between the agencies entrusted with supervision
and regulation of UCBs viz. Central and State Governments and Reserve Bank of
India, certain processes and platforms for regular and structured consultation
have been established by us. A Standing Advisory Committee comprising senior
representatives of Central and state Governments and Federation of UCBs has
been constituted, which meets the top and senior management of Reserve Bank
once or twice a year and reviews past policies and also gives responses on
important policy proposals and other issues of immediate concern. The
committee also serves as a platform for the representative of the regulated
entities to express their views in respect of any regulatory and supervisory issue.
This also enables RBI to get a pulse on all emerging issues of the sector.
Non-disruptive exit route for non-viable banks
The Reserve Bank’s experience with the UCB sector clearly underscored
the necessity for providing a non-disruptive exit route for non-viable banks.
Accordingly, this aspect has been incorporated in the vision document.
TAFCUBs constituted in the states that have signed MOU have been entrusted
with the task of identifying potentially viable and non-viable UCBs and suggesting
suitable revival path for the former and a non-disruptive exit route for the latter.
The exit of non-viable banks would be ideally through merger / amalgamation
with stronger banks or conversion into societies that would take deposits only
from members without providing cheque facility or ultimately, through liquidation
as a last resort.22
Merger and consolidation
The consolidation of the sector through the process of merger of weak
entities with stronger ones has been set into motion by providing transparent and
objective guidelines for granting no-objection to merger proposals as a strategy
for providing non-disruptive exit for the weak banks. It also set up a three
member Expert Group of outsiders to vet the merger proposals, to provide a
transparent mechanism to the process and impartial inputs on such requests.
TAFCUBs have representatives of the sector who also provide local level inputs
on banks that are on the lookout for taking over other weak banks for expansion
of business. The merger process has gathered momentum over the last one
year, partly because the stronger banks found this an inorganic growth route.. In
all 44 merger proposals have been approved so far, of which no objection
certificate has been issued for 23 proposals. Of these, 14 mergers have already
materialized.
Liquidation and settlement of depositors' claims
Banks that are identified as non-viable and as having no scope
whatsoever for revival by merger etc. are taken into liquidation keeping in view
the interest of depositors. In liquidation cases, the Deposit Insurance and Credit
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) expeditiously settle the claims of depositors.
However, in certain cases, there is a time lag in settlement of claims mainly on
account of delay in submission of the claim list by the liquidators. Other factors
which affect timely settlement of claims are audit of claim list by Chartered
Accountants, court cases, delay in receipt of liquidation order from the RCS,
deficiency in claim list prepared by the liquidators etc. DICGC has put in place
follow-up and monitoring measures to mitigate the hardship faced by the
depositors on account of such delays and facilitate settlement of claim list of
failed banks at the earliest.23
Recent initiatives
Apart from drawing up the vision document, signing of MOUs with certain
states and constitution of TAFCUBs in those states, the Reserve Bank has
initiated several other measures for strengthening Urban Cooperative Banks like
exploring avenues for raising capital, upgrading technology and training
initiatives, the progress in respect of which is outlined below.
Avenues for UCBs to raise Capital
The scope for augmenting the capital of UCBs is limited. The Reserve
Bank, therefore, constituted a group comprising representatives of the Bank,
State Government and UCB, to study the avenues, methods and scope for
increasing the capital of UCBs and imparting greater permanence to it. The group
has submitted its report.
The Group has identified four new instruments to enable the UCBs to raise
long-term capital/quasi capital funds. These are:
• Unsecured, subordinated, non-convertible redeemable debentures/ bonds,
• Special shares that are non-voting in nature (as opposed to shares with
membership rights) which could be issued even at a premium,
• (Redeemable cumulative preference shares, and
• Long term subordinated deposits with maturity in excess of 15 years.
The Group has recommended that the funds raised through the special
shares which are non-voting in nature (as opposed to shares with membership
rights) which could be issued even at a premium may be reckoned for Tier-I
capital and the rest for Tier-II capital. None of these instruments would have a put
option but could have a call option exercisable by the bank with the prior
permission of the Reserve Bank. Exercise of call option/redemption in case of
debentures/bonds and special shares would be subject to a lock-in clause of the24
bank meeting the prescribed Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio at the
relevant time.
Since UCBs come under the purview of the Co-operative Societies Act of
the State in which they are registered or the Multi-state Co-operative Societies
Act (2002), the provisions of which are not similar in certain respects, the Group
has suggested necessary amendments to the Acts/Rules framed under them to
facilitate issuance of some of the instruments proposed by it.
Technology initiatives
 In order to enhance the access to technology for UCBs, Reserve Bank
would consider facilitating acquisition of basic hardware and software for
conducting routine operations. Further, software has also been developed to
enable the UCBs to prepare and submit all returns to Reserve Bank,
electronically. The software has been implemented free of cost in the banks and
the officials of banks are also being provided adequate training in using the
software, which enables banks to maintain a database of returns submitted to the
supervisor which in turn acts as a MIS for the UCBs. The stronger UCBs also are
members of clearing house and of the Real Time Gross Settlement System.
Skills development/training, including Directors and auditors training
To the extent that it does not lead to any conflict of interest, the Reserve
Bank of India, in addition to its regulatory and supervisory functions also seeks to
play a developmental role for the urban cooperative banks. In this context, in
order to improve the skill level of human resources and the technological
infrastructure of UCBs, RBI in addition to subsidized programs also provides free
of cost training on all important areas of banking operations to the staff and top
managements of UCBs through its own training establishments as also through
off-shore training programs at regional centers that have a large network of such
banks. As mentioned earlier, a software has been developed for banks to help
them prepare and submit all the returns to RBI, electronically and the software
has been implemented free of cost by RBI, in the banks.25
Recent Developments
As envisaged in the Vision Document, Reserve Bank approached states
having large network of UCBs for signing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
to ensure greater coordination between RBI and State Government for
supervision and regulation of the UCBs. Since June 2005, MOUs have been
signed with 8 state governments viz. Andhra Pradesh (124 banks), Gujarat (296
banks), Karnataka (297 banks), Madhya Pradesh (61 banks), Uttranchal (7
banks), Rajasthan (39 banks), Chattisgarh (14 banks) and Goa (6 banks) which
together constitute 844 UCBs i.e. over 45 percent of total number of UCBs and
account for almost 23% of deposits of the sector.
As mentioned earlier, upon signing of MOU, as per the agreement, RBI
constituted State Level Task Force for Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB),
which is a six-member body with two representatives each from State
Government, UCB sector and Reserve Bank. The TAFCUBs are chaired by the
respective Regional Directors of RBI and RCS is the Co-Chairperson. TAFCUBs
also have representatives of the sector who provide local level inputs on banks
that are on the lookout for taking over other weak banks for expansion of
business. As such, the constitution of TAFCUBs and their role in the development
of the UCBs in the state on sound lines constitutes a compelling attraction for the
state governments to sign the MOU with RBI.
Regional flavour of TAFCUBS
In order to further instil transparency and improve inter regulatory
coordination, the MoU signed between RBI and the state government also
envisages signing of another MoU between the Registrar of Cooperative
Societies of the State and respective Regional Directors of the Reserve Bank.
This MOU stipulates the broad measures to be taken by the signatories for
implementing the recommendations of the TAFCUB for each of the potentially
viable/non-viable UCBs that are placed for consideration of TAFCUB. In the last26
one-year five TAFCUBs (other TAFCUBs constituted very recently) have
deliberated upon and made recommendations on the financial position of about
250 weak UCBs. Based on TAFCUBs recommendations, supervisory actions that
have been taken include exiting banks through merger with other UCBs,
cancellation of license of unviable UCBs and issue of license to unlicensed
cooperative societies.
Gains of ‘MOU -TAFCUB’ mechanism – empirical evidence
The impact of a consultative platform is reflected in the decline in the
number of weak and sick banks in the states which were among the first to sign
the MOU and therefore TAFCUBs were constituted the earliest (Table 6).

Conclusion
I have traced the evolution of UCBs, their unique structure, strengths and
weakness. I have also indicated the multi-pronged approach adopted by RBI to
arrest deterioration and strengthen the banks in this sector, including the recent
developments. Our initiatives, we hope, would lead to the evolution of the urban
cooperative banking system into a strong and vibrant sector with banks that
conform to all prudential requirements in the medium term and become at par
with the commercial banks in terms of competitiveness and performance. Looking
at this large gathering of academics, bankers and other professionals, I am sure
my address would have kindled your interest and involvement on the subject. I
welcome your views on our approach towards strengthening this important sector
of Indian banking.
Thank You.27
