1RESERVE BANK OF INDIA[March 18, 2006]Prime Minister's SpeechMy Cabinet colleague Chidambaramji,Dr. Reddy, Ladies and Gentlemen,It is always a pleasure to be here.  There is always something specialabout returning to a place that was one's own home.  Even more so when onehas only happy and warm memories.  For me and my family, Mumbai has beena second home, and I have the fondest of memories of my tenure here at theReserve Bank of India.I am delighted to release the third volume of the History of Reserve Bankof India covering the period 1967-1981.  Those were truly momentous years forthe central bank, marked by the nationalization of banks, a phenomenalexpansion and diversification of the financial sector and battles with monetarypolicy during an era of high inflation.Taken together, the three published volumes covering the period 1935 to1981, span a truly historic phase in the economic evolution of India and in thematuration of our financial institutions.  On this occasion, I pay tribute to theformer Governors of the Reserve Bank such as C.D.Deshmukh, L.K. Jha, S.Jagannathan, I.G. Patel, R.N.Malhotra, C.Rangarajan, and Bimal Jalan whocontributed to the growth and evolution of this great institution.Institutional histories are important because they record the role played byinstitutions in shaping events of the time.  But history is not a mere record ofevents.  A useful history must also look beyond and behind the events, analyse,explain and evaluate the role played by the institutions in shaping and designingpublic policy of the time as well as the impact of the political and economiccircumstances of the time on the institution itself.  I am sure that the threevolumes narrating the functioning of the Reserve Bank during the period 1935-1981 will not only have a 'historical value' but also 'contemporary relevance'.Ladies and Gentlemen,The role of central banks, starting with the establishment of the Bank ofEngland in 1694, has evolved over time.  It is now widely agreed that the keyfunctions of a central bank are to maintain monetary and financial stability.Central banks in developing and emerging economies, however, have theadditional responsibility of promoting development and growth through aproactive role.  I had noted more than two decades back when I was theGovernor of the Reserve Bank: "the policies of a country's central bank andmonetary authority have profound implications for the functioning of any modern                                           1 "Credit Policy of the Reserve Bank of India".

Viewedfrom this perspective, the Reserve Bank has contributed to economic growth andemployment generation in the economy through maintenance of price andfinancial stability while ensuring adequate availability of credit to various sectionsof the society.  In addition, the Reserve Bank has also successfully dischargedits non-traditional responsibilities such as the development of agricultural credit,rural co-operatives and development finance institutions.  These facets of theReserve Bank's role are well documented in the History volumes being releasedtoday.During the 1990s, in the changed milieu, the Reserve Bank had a greaterrole to play in ensuring macroeconomic stability.  Structural reforms wereinitiated to improve the efficiency of the economy and the country's growthprospects in the aftermath of the unprecedented balance of payments crisis ofthe early 1990s.  These reforms were successful in achieving their objectives.  Inthe post-reform period, India has been able to achieve a higher growth rate in anenvironment of macro-economic stability.  Financial and external sector reformshave been a key ingredient of structural reforms initiated in the Indian economyand in both these areas the Reserve Bank has played a proactive role incoordination with the Government.Price StabilityLadies and Gentlemen,Compared with many developing economies, the Indian inflationexperience can be considered satisfactory despite recurrent supply shocks.Although inflation increased during the 1970s and remained high thereafter tillthe mid-1990s, reflecting in large part fiscal expansion, the period since then haswitnessed a significant lowering of inflation and inflation expectations, thanks toa prudent monetary policy.  Indeed, inflation has averaged less than 5% over thepast decade.  It is a matter of great satisfaction that in the past couple of years,despite record high international crude oil prices, we have been able to keepinflation low and contain inflationary expectations.Monetary-Fiscal InterfaceCross-country experience suggests that success with achieving andmaintaining price stability is crucially dependent upon the nature of monetary-fiscal interface and fiscal prudence.  I had observed two decades back "Indianexperience both in 1974-75 and 1981-82 shows that an active monetary policycan play an important role in curbing inflationary expectations.  However, ifmonetary restraint is to achieve its objective without too much loss of potentialoutput, excessive burden must not be placed on monetary policy.  In addition,the fiscal system must be so operated as to avoid excessive recourse to2Reserve Bank credit for financing public expenditure" .  While this aspect wasrecognized in the 1970s and 1980s, it was only during the post-reform 1990s                                           2"Credit Policy of the Reserve Bank of India".  Inaugural Address at the seminarorganized by Maharashtra Economic Development Council, Mumbai on November 18, 1982.that the Reserve Bank began to enjoy flexibility in the conduct of monetarypolicy.  The key policy development that enabled a more independent monetarypolicy environment was the discontinuation of automatic monetisation of thegovernment's fiscal deficit through an agreement between the Government andthe Reserve Bank of India in 1997.This has been further strengthened by the enactment of the FRBM Act.  From2006-07, the Reserve Bank will no longer be permitted to subscribe togovernment securities in the primary market.  Given the critical importance offiscal-monetary interface in ensuring macroeconomic stability, our Government iscommitted to pursuing the path of fiscal consolidation as laid out by the FRBMAct.  A prudent fiscal policy lightens the burden to be borne by monetary policy.Adherence to these fiscal rules will help to manage inflation expectations andkeep inflation low and stable.  It is now widely acknowledged that the best waymonetary policy can contribute to growth and higher employment generation isthrough price stability - defined as low and stable inflation.  Inflation is aregressive tax that hits the poor the most.  Price stability is, therefore, all themore important for an economy like ours, with a large proportion of poorpopulation that has no hedge against inflation.Financial StabilityLadies and Gentlemen,While price stability is important and necessary, it is not sufficient.  Withthe opening up of the economy since the early 1990s, financial stability has nowemerged as a second key consideration in the conduct of monetary policy inIndia.  It is heartening to note that the RBI has also been successful inmaintaining financial stability in the country even during the progressiveliberalization of the economy from the early 1990s.  The Indian record on thisfront is especially noteworthy as the decade of the 1990s has been otherwiseturbulent for the financial sector in most emerging market economies.  Financialsector reforms in India initiated during the 1990s were aimed at promoting adiversified, efficient and competitive financial sector and the reforms havesucceeded in their objectives.  In the environment of a deregulated financialsector, our ability to maintain financial stability, even as it eluded many othereconomies, can be attributed to the success achieved in ensuring reasonableprice stability in the economy on the one hand and prudent policies in regard tofinancial and external sector management on the other.External Sector ManagementExternal sector management of the economy has been one of the morenotable successes of macroeconomic management in the country.  India'scautious approach towards opening of the capital account with preference forFDI flows, while de-emphasising short-term debt flows, and viewing capitalaccount liberalization as a process contingent upon certain pre-conditions hasbeen vindicated in the light of the financial crises in a number of emergingeconomies.  This cautious approach in regard to capital flows is clearlywarranted, given the fact that capital flows are known to exhibit a highly cyclicalpattern.  It is, therefore, necessary to attract relatively stable component ofcapital flows while de-emphasising the volatile components.  Concomitantly,there is a need to build foreign exchange reserves beyond the traditional importcover criterion.  India's policy of building adequate foreign exchange reserveshas contributed to maintaining financial stability and added to the economy'sresilience.Ladies and Gentlemen,India's current account balance, after posting modest surpluses during2001-2004, has returned to a deficit in consonance with the resurgence ininvestment demand in the economy.  India's merchandise exports have beenrecording a robust growth along with exports of services.  Non-oil import demandremains strong.  Against this backdrop, the current account deficit by itselfshould not be a cause for concern.  I believe our current account deficit is still ina comfort zone as it can easily be financed through normal capital flows.Finally, our exchange rate policy of a largely market-determined exchangerate with a focus on managing volatility has stood the test of time.  The Indianexperience highlights the need for flexibility and pragmatism in the managementof exchange rate.Ladies and Gentlemen,In concluding, I must confess that the success of the reforms we launchedin the 1990s, both in stabilizing our economy and modernizing our financialsector, has been beyond our expectations at the time.  The Reserve Bank hasplayed an important role in the implementation of reforms by maintaining priceand financial stability and by contributing to building a robust external sectorduring a time of great flux.We have bigger challenges ahead.  Growth has to accelerate further.Poverty has to be reduced faster.  Employment has to be expanded quicker.The credit needs - both of our farmers and the small and medium enterprisesector - have to be met on a priority basis.  Our banking system must also payadequate attention to meeting the demand for credit by the decentralized sectorat an affordable cost.  This is our national agenda.  The Reserve Bank too willhave an increasing role in pursuing this national agenda.Today, globalization is changing many familiar things - the way we think,act and perform.  It is changing central banking too.  Funds in large amountsmove across borders with ease and speed.  Maintaining financial stability in theface of such forces of globalization is a challenge.  But globalization is anopportunity too as it makes it possible to harness global capital in search ofinvestments for furthering national goals.  The Reserve Bank has to remainahead of the curve so as to minimize the costs and maximize the benefits ofglobalization for the country.A proposal to make Mumbai a Regional Financial Centre is already underactive consideration.  Our economic reforms have accelerated growth, enhancedstability and strengthened both external and financial sectors.  Our trade as wellas financial sectors are already considerably integrated with the global economyand the trend is irreversible.  Mumbai, with all its inherent advantages in terms ofhuman capital and commercial acumen, can be positioned as a viable RegionalFinancial Centre.  We need to work towards this objective.Given the changes that have taken place over the last two decades, thereis merit in moving towards fuller capital account convertibility within a transparentframework.  This issue was first examined by the Tarapore Committee.  Muchwater has flown down the Ganga since then.  Our own position, internally andexternally, has become far more comfortable.  I will, therefore, request theFinance Minister and the Reserve Bank to revisit the subject and come out witha roadmap based on current realities.  Progress in this regard will facilitate thetransformation of Mumbai into not only a Regional but also a Global FinancialCentre.  There are multiple options that are possible for such a centre, includingas an SEZ, and I am confident that we can make steady but firm progress in thatdirection.  The State Government will have to ensure an appropriate enablingenvironment, in particular the physical infrastructure.Ladies and Gentlemen,As a large, fast growing economy, there is increasing global interest inIndia.  The motive force behind India's emergence as a knowledge economy isthe skill endowment and capacity of our work force.  We should strive not only tomaintain, but improve our comparative advantage in the services sector.Financial services have emerged as one of the major service industries in theIndian economy.  At the same time, the integration of Indian financial marketsinto the global system and the introduction of new financial products requirebetter risk management and financial engineering skills.  It also casts newburdens on regulatory institutions.  Enhancing the skills of personnel involved inthe financial sector is, therefore important.The Bankers Training College is one of the frontier institutions under theRBI umbrella.  In view of the rapidly changing environment, and given thegrowing strength of the Indian financial sector, there is a strong need for aninstitution that can act as a centre for policy research on areas relating tobanking and finance.  The BTC is well-poised to take on this new role.Therefore, the BTC will henceforth be repositioned as a policy oriented instituteand I am happy to rename the BTC as "Centre for Advanced FinancialLearning".  I am sure that in the near future, the Centre would grow into a globalhub for banking and finance.  I wish the Centre all the best in its challenging role.Ladies and Gentlemen,The independent role of the Reserve Bank in articulating its views on theeconomy and the pursuit of policies aimed at promoting monetary and financialstability are key factors in our economic management.I wish you the very best in fulfilling these tasks.  Thank you.
