Financial Stability : The Indian Experience SAARCFINANCE   Governors Symposium  Shyamala Gopinath 1 FINANCIAL STABILITY AT THE  CENTRE STAGE Financial stability Came to the fore in the wake of the global crisis Recognition of a need to pursue financial stability as an explicit  policy objective International policy initiatives to ensure financial stability G20, the Financial Stability Board, Basel Committee, IMF and  other international institutions Increasing the resilience of financial institutions and  infrastructure  A macroprudential approach to regulation and supervision  International cooperation Institutional arrangements for financial stability Councils for a collegial approach to preserving financial stability Central banks being increasingly called upon to shoulder the  2 greater burden of managing systemic risks  FINANCIAL STABILITY IN INDIA:  EARLY BEGINNINGS Though not an explicitly defined mandate for the Reserve Bank,  pursuance of financial stability has been the critical policy driver. The broader macro-policy context overarches the policy frameworks  for: Monetary management Institutional regulation  banks as well as non-banks External account Market development and regulation  Financing of sovereign liabilities  3 THE INDIAN APPROACH TO  FINANCIAL STABILITY Prudential framework for banks is comprehensive and  addresses  Interconnectedness  prudential limits on aggregate inter-bank liabilities for banks  as a proportion of their net worth.  The overnight un-collateralised funding market is restricted  only to banks and primary dealers and there are ceilings for  both lending as well as borrowing Investment by banks in subordinated debt of other banks is  assigned 100% risk weight for capital adequacy purpose.  Banks aggregate investment in Tier II bonds issued by other  banks and financial institutions is limited to 10 % of the  investing bank's total capital. 4 Exposure of banks to any single NBFC is capped as a  percentage of banks capital funds THE INDIAN APPROACH TO  FINANCIAL STABILITY Prudential framework for banks addresses  Excessive dollarisation of bank balance sheets Limits on the proportion of wholesale foreign currency liabilities  intermediated through the banking system. Retail foreign currency deposits from non-residents are subject to  minimum maturity requirements and interest rate caps. Countercyclical approach to regulation Varying risk weights and provisioning norms  sectoral approach Imposition of LTV ratios Introduced requirement of investment fluctuation reserve (IFR)  of a minimum 5 % of the investment portfolio as a buffer for  5 interest rate risk during a low interest rate regime.   THE INDIAN APPROACH TO  FINANCIAL STABILITY Capital Account Management Framework Substantially large freedom to equity flows  both FDI as well as  portfolio flows Regulatory framework for External Debt flows with a combination  of administrative, quantitative and price based measures.  Management of sovereign borrowings Banks permitted to hold  stipulated 25 % investment in  Government securities as held to maturity. Limited  dependence on foreign investors in respect of domestic  currency debt Strong domestic investor base, apart from banks, in the form of  6 insurance and pension/provident funds, which has enabled India to  elongate the maturity of its domestic debt.  THE INDIAN APPROACH TO  FINANCIAL STABILITY NBFCs -Shadow banking Regulatory perimeter extends to large NBFCs  identified as systemically important engaged in  credit intermediation.  Subject to capital adequacy  and other prudential norms.  SPVs exist but do not undertake significant  liquidity and maturity transformation.  Conservative securitisation guidelines. Hedge funds and private equity not within  regulatory perimeter. Currently not highly  leveraged. The issue of regulation of such entities  being addressed. 7 MMFs - liquidity transformation issues need to be  addressed THE INDIAN APPROACH TO  FINANCIAL STABILITY Regulation of financial markets Calibrated approach to liberalisation Exotic derivatives have not been allowed Regulatory framework for all OTC derivative markets, unlike most advanced countries  Repo markets, which were at the heart of the crisis, are well  regulated. Foreign participation in these markets is under a regulated  framework    part of capital account management  Conservative prudential and accounting guidelines for banks  capital, liquidity, leverage 8 Shift towards CCPs much before the crisis  THE INDIAN APPROACH TO  FINANCIAL STABILITY Monitoring large financial conglomerates  Consolidated regulation Two-pronged structured process in the nature of off- site surveillance and the periodic interface with the  conglomerates Arrangement for supervisory information sharing  amongst the regulators to address specific issues in  the monitoring of the identified conglomerate   Steps underway to tighten the capital adequacy  norms for these conglomerates.  9 PRE CRISIS INSTITUTIONAL  ARRANGEMENTS A well defined regulatory framework for the Indian  financial system The Reserve Bank regulates the banking sector and the NBFCs  SEBI, IRDA and PFRDA are the other sectoral regulators A High Level Co-ordination Committee on Financial  Markets For inter-regulatory coordination Committees of Reserve Banks Central Board  Board for  Financial Supervision and Board for Payment and  Settlement Systems Focused regulation of financial institutions and infrastructure  Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 10 An effective safety net arrangement  POST CRISIS INSTITUTIONAL  ARRANGEMENTS Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) and  its Sub-Committee  a collegial approach to financial  stability The FSDC  headed by the Union Finance Minister - providing broad oversight The Sub-Committee  headed by the Governor, Reserve  Bank  the operating arm for financial stability in peace  times A multi-disciplinary department  the Financial Stability  Unit  within the Reserve Bank  Conducting ongoing macroprudential surveillance of the  financial system 11 Bi-annual Financial Stability Reports Initiatives to gauge stresses in the financial system  BANKING STABILITY INDEX AND  FINANCIAL STRESS INDICATOR To gauge build up of excesses/vulnerabilities in the  banking sector and in financial markets  Banking Stability Map Financial Stress Indicator  4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 12 -3 Apr-07 Jul-07 Oct-07 Jan-08 Apr-08 Jul-08 Oct-08 Jan-09 Apr-09 Jul-09 Oct-09 Jan-10 Apr-10 Jul-10 Oct-10 Jan-11 Apr-11 Jul-11 NETWORK ANALYSIS Analytical models which help identify, monitor and address  systemic risks The network of the Indian Contagion analysis of an  Banking Sector idiosyncratic failure of an Indian  bank  13 BANKING STABILITY MEASURES A set of stability measures which take into account the distress dependence  amongst banks   Joint probability of default and Banking Stability Index (probability of  all banks in the system experiencing large losses simultaneously and the  expected number of banks under distress when at least one bank is  distressed) Toxicity and Vulnerability Index  the probability of a bank causing  distress to another bank and of coming under distress if another bank in  the system fails The Toxicity Index The Vulnerability Index 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 14 0 0 10/10/2007 10/10/2008 10/10/2009 10/10/2010 10/10/2007 10/10/2008 10/10/2009 10/10/2010 MACRO-FINANCIAL STRESS  TESTING  A model based methodology to assess the impact of  macroeconomic variables on the performance of the  financial system Non-performing advances under stress scenarios 15 INITIATIVES FOR MAINTAINING  FINANCIAL STABILITY The Indian approach to financial stability has stood the  test of time Contagion impact of global crises were managed with relative  equanimity Preventing crisis through ex ante actions has been our approach. Going forward, there are many challenges Crisis prevention - each crisis will be different. Anticipating and  taking timely action essential.  Growing complexities in the financial sector  domestically and  internationally. 16 Addressing financial stability issues arising from operations of Indian banks overseas  and globalisation of Indian corporates. EMERGING CHALLENGES  Gaps in the availability of data and its integrity Absence of Data in respect of risks concentrations,  interconnections in the financial sector   New techniques and analytical methods a sine quo non  for financial stability assessment Communication of risks to financial stability Coordination with all agencies With other functional arms within the Reserve Bank With other regulators  and with the government  17 Developing skill sets  SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE  EMERGING CONTOURS There is still no coherent framework emerging for  regulation of financial markets from a stability  perspective.  In the area of reforming markets, the singular area of action  has been to address counterparty risks and non- transparency in the OTC market by taking all such markets  on to central clearing platforms.  Entity regulation - higher capital charge for trading and  securitization transactions.  Role of banks and other entities in providing liquidity and  leverage to financial market participants not addressed  adequately  18 In search of the holy grail of level playing field - counterproductive for financial stability SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE  EMERGING CONTOURS  Continuing disconnect between the financial  sector and the real sector? Post-crisis risk containment measures, in fact,  pose the danger of perpetuating the dominance of  trading activities in a bank  by making them  uber-safe through CCPs, now considered a SIFI  It is the traditional lending activities that may be  forced to shoulder much of the burden of increased  capital 19 SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE  EMERGING CONTOURS  An issue which will be of critical importance to the  EMEs from a stability perspective is the nature of  presence of foreign financial institutions - exposure of  the domestic financial systems to the risk of proxy  contamination with problems in global markets Effectiveness and intensity of supervisory process - the  decision making framework and space for the  regulators given that dynamic judgement is necessary  to deal  with system risk that is constantly changing.  Rating agencies continue to rate SIFIs on the basis of  20 implicit support from Government SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE  EMERGING CONTOURS  Macro-prudential regulation  Macroprudential regulation is an inexact science  and needs to be used in conjunction with other  policies to be effective.  Important to acknowledge what macroprudential  regulation cannot do: It cannot manage economic  cycles and  or target asset prices. It can only provide  instruments to respond to these developments to  cushion the financial system from stresses Mistaking Articulation for Action (MAFA)  phenomenon  21THANK YOU 22
