Inflation Dynamics in India: Issues and Concerns*  Deepak Mohanty   I thank the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry for giving me this opportunity  to speak on inflation which is of immediate concern for our economy.  I will begin with the  trends in inflation, then briefly touch upon the costs of inflation, followed by an analysis of  current inflation dynamics.  I will conclude by flagging the areas of policy concern.    Trends in Inflation  There are expectations that the high levels of slack in resource utilisation and stable  1 inflation expectations will contain global inflationary pressures in 2010 .  The IMF projected the  headline inflation in advanced economies at 1.3 per cent in 2010 and in emerging and developing  economies at 6.2 per cent. In divergence with the global trend, India has witnessed a sharp  increase in WPI inflation from a negative terrain during June-August 2009 to 9.9 per cent by  February 2010. The increase in consumer prices are even higher in the range of 14.9  16.9 per  cent   (Table 1).                                                    *Speech by Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, delivered at the Bombay Chamber of  th Commerce and Industry, on 4 March, 2010.

While there is this issue of divergence between wholesale price and consumer price based  2 inflation measures, I do not propose to delve into that in this lecture .  I will, however, make two  points.  First, though the inflation indices have shown divergence in the past, the annual inflation  based on the wholesale price index (WPI), consumer price index for industrial workers (CPI-                                                   2   For a detailed analysis of this, please see Deepak Mohanty (2010): Measures of Inflation in India: Issues and  Perspectives, speech delivered at the Conference of Indian Association for Research in National Income and  Wealth at the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Thiruvanthapuram, on January 9.    2   IW), gross domestic product (GDP) deflator, and private final consumption expenditure (PFCE)  deflator have, on an average, followed a similar path over long time spans (Table 2). Second, the  current divergence could largely be attributed to different weightage of food in WPI and CPIs.

Why is inflation a concern? It is a cause of concern for public policy because of the  associated costs, especially when a large part of the population has no hedge against inflation.  First, inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. Fixed-income earners and  pensioners see a decline in their disposable income and standard of living.   Second, there is diminution of real value of savings as real interest rates turn negative and  return on savings does not fully compensate for price rise.   Third, economic agents base their consumption and investment decisions on their current  and expected future income as well as their expectations on future inflation rates.  Persistent high inflation alters inflationary expectations and apprehension arising from  price uncertainty does lead to cut in spending by individuals and slowdown in investment  by corporates which hurts economic growth in the long run.  3   Fourth, if the inflation rate is increasing faster than those in other countries then domestic  products become less competitive which has adverse impact on growth, employment and  the balance of payments.  Fifth, high inflation worsens inequality due to arbitrary redistribution of income where  the poor suffer the most as the rich can hedge against inflation.  Finally, the policy measures for reducing inflation have their externalities and associated  costs in terms of reduction in aggregate demand in the short to medium run.   Inflation Dynamics    Milton Friedman famously said, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary  3 phenomenon. It is believed that short-run inflation dynamics is largely dependent on supply- demand conditions and monetary expansion influences inflationary condition in the long-run.  Monetary expansion could be caused by persistence of high fiscal deficit and the need to finance  the same by monetisation. Consequently, high monetary growth could lead to continued excess  demand for a prolonged period without matching increase in output and productivity. On the  other hand, supply conditions have strong influence on the inflation dynamics in the short run.   In a rapidly growing developing economy like ours, both structural and idiosyncratic  factors could play a significant role in the determination of inflation. In the recent years, the  inward looking nature of Indian economy has been changing. Activities in almost all the sectors  in varying degrees are influenced by global factors, be it trade in commodities, provision of  services, financing conditions, or consumer taste. Now domestic prices are more influenced by  changes in global commodity prices for a wide range of goods  a sea change from the 1970s and  1980s when crude prices were major global influencing factors.    Taking into account the influence of global and domestic factors,   the overall WPI basket  can be divided into four commodity groups which have differential behaviour (Chart 1).                                                    3  Milton Friedman (1963): Inflation: Causes and Consequences , Asia Publishing House, New York  4   First, food items excluding oilseed products (weight in WPI: 24.2 per cent) : Prices of this  group of commodities are largely determined by domestic factors and, in the event of  supply shortage, imports influences international prices too.  Second, oilseeds and products (weight in WPI: 6.8 per cent): This relatively small  commodity group has often induced sudden surge in headline WPI as there is a structural  shortage and nearly a third of domestic consumption of edible oils is met from imports.   Third, mineral oils and metals (weight in WPI: 15.3 per cent): Prices of this group of  commodities are largely determined by international prices and the volatility in headline  WPI inflation in recent years can largely be attributed to fluctuations in the international  prices.  Fourth, other commodities (weight in WPI: 53.7 per cent): These remaining commodities,  largely manufactured products, constitute more than half of the WPI basket and their  prices have been more stable than the other three groups.  Empirical evidence suggests that among the above four groups, there is transmission of  prices from mineral oils and metals to the other commodities group within a quarter. The full  transmissions of food prices to other commodities takes longer, almost a year.    A comparison of domestic and global commodity price movement reveal the following.  First, the direction of price movements has been similar, but the overall global commodity price  movements have been more volatile, with a pronounced spike in 2007 and 2008 (Chart 2).  Second, the increase in metal prices have been closely followed the global prices.  Third,  domestic prices of petroleum products have been less volatile than the corresponding  international prices reflecting administered prices in this group.  Fourth, increase in domestic  food prices, excepting the global spike in 2007 and 2008 has been higher reflecting structural and  domestic factors (Table 3).   5               6    Chart 3: Movement in Global and Domestic Prices of Select Commodities     7     Table 3: Commodity Price Changes: Global and Domestic        (per cent)  Annual Growth Rate  (Log-linear trend:  Coefficient of Variation Commodity Group  1993-2009)    India World India World  All Commodities 4.9 7.3 0.30 1.69  Of which:  Food Items (excl.Edible Oils) 4.4 1.8 0.61 2.85  Oilseeds and products (incl.Edible Oils) 4.5 1.5 1.82 4.60  Mineral Oils 11.0 12.4 0.92 1.79  Metals 6.4 6.8 0.84 2.88    Note: For World Prices, price index closest to the corresponding WPI group is used from the IMF Commodity Price database.     Food prices in India are primarily determined by domestic demand supply factors and  domestic price policy. India meets the bulk of its large food demand through domestic  production, barring few commodities like edible oils and pulses where the import dependence is  about 35 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively.  In occasional shortage years, the country has  also resorted to imports for wheat and sugar though it is generally an exporter in these  commodities (Table 4). Indias occasional imports of such commodities translate into higher  global food prices as the import demand is large. Hence, imports do not necessarily lead to  domestic prices moving lower.

The high increase in MSP since 2007-08 has given an upward bias to agricultural  prices  (Table 5).  Table 5: Agricultural Commodities - Variations in MSP and WPI                                                                       (per cent)  Average Annual Growth Rate  2003-04 to  2007-08 to   Commodity  2006-07 2009-10  2.3 18.3 MSP  Paddy  2.0 10.9 WPI  MSP 5.1 14.4 Wheat  5.5 6.7 WPI  MSP 1.7 18.0 Tur  3.9 26.3 WPI  3.4 23.2 MSP  Moong  11.3 13.2 WPI  MSP : Minimum Support Price   WPI for 2009-10 is averaged up to February 2010    Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Office of Economic Adviser,  Ministry of  Commerce and Industry.    Reduced availability of foodgrains also tends to keep food prices high.  As per the  Economic Survey 2009-10, per capita net availability per day of cereals and pulses has been  lower than that observed in the previous four decades. The per capita daily availability of  foodgrains was 447 grams in the 1960s and 1970s, which successively increased to 459 grams in  the 1980s and 478 grams in the 1990s but came down to 446 grams during 2000-08 and stood  still lower at 436 grams in 2008. Severe drought in major parts of the country during the current  year has perceptibly worsened food availability further. In particular, the situation is far more  worrisome for pulses: its per capita net availability per day has gone down from around 60-70  grams during the 1950s to around 30 grams currently.    On the demand side, a major economic transformation in India in the recent years has  been the surge in rural demand which has now lower dependence on the farm sector. As per the  National Sample Survey (NSS) data, the share of rural consumption in overall consumption was  about 58 per cent in 2006-07.  The non-farm sector consumption accounts for about 55-60 per  cent of the total rural consumption. While farm sector demand is more prone to the vagaries of  9   weather, non-farm rural sector has imparted more stability in the recent years due to increased  focus on the rural development, particularly through enhanced outlays under various public  schemes.     Given the stage of our economic development, the demand for food items would increase  with economic growth and rise in income levels.  Demographic dividend which has been  contributing towards Indias growth and productivity, has also raised consumption demand,  particularly on food. As per the United Nations projection, high-consumption cohort in the age- group of 15-59 individuals comprising around 65 per cent of Indias total population will  continue dominate demand till 2040.       Thus, lower per capita availability of foodgrains and structural shortage of key  agricultural commodities like oilseeds and pulses combined with the rising demand have kept  food price inflation high. This process has got further accentuated by spikes in global food  prices.  Conclusions  Recent surge in inflation has raised the concern whether the supply-driven increase could  spillover to the generalised inflation process. Prolonged high inflation even if originating from  supply side would give rise to increase inflation expectations and cause general prices to rise.  Poorly anchored in inflation expectations makes long-term financial planning more complex  with potential adverse effects on investment and growth. It is, therefore, important to keep  inflation expectations anchored so that consumers do not mark up their long-run inflation  expectations by reacting to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation.    Higher the inflation rate, the longer it takes for the inflation to revert to its trend. Slow  return of inflation rate to its equilibrium level after a supply shock is known as inflation  persistence, which is important in the determination of the pace of monetary policy adjustment  to achieve the desired target.  In our context, empirical analysis shows a high degree of  persistence, especially in the case of food and edible oil groups.  This hinders supply responses  to work in a timely fashion.   10   Even though the supply side factors dominate the current inflationary pressures, given the  risks of spillover into a wider inflationary process, there is need for policy response.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank began its exit from expansionary monetary policy in October  2009 by reducing the potential liquidity. This process was carried forward in January 2010 with  an increase in cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks by 75 basis points and then increase in policy  reverse repo and repo rates by 25 basis points each in March 2010. While monetary policy action  will anchor inflation expectations, there is an urgent need to address the issue of structural supply  constraints, particularly in agriculture, so that these do not become a binding constraint in the  long run making the task of inflation management more difficult.      11
