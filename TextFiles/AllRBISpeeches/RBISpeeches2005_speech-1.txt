????Importance of Productivity in IndiaRespected Professor Papola and friends,It is an honour and privilege to address this august gathering.  I amhappy to visit Visakhapatnam, where, in 1965, I commenced my career in civilservices in Andhra Pradesh as an Assistant Collector under training - learninginitially from village karnam of Penduthri village (then a village) and RevenueInspector of Gajuvoka, travelling by bicycle to the villages.  I am particularlydelighted that a friend for decades, an economist of eminence and a person ofoutstanding personal values is delivering the Presidential Address at thisconference today.At the instance of late Professor P.R. Brahmananda, I delivered thethvaledictory address at the Amrit Jubilee (i.e., 80 year) conference of theIndian Economic Association in December 1997 and the subject was"Economists and Public Policy".  The community of economists may be happyto know that the Reserve Bank of India has instituted a memorial lecture in hishonour as a token of respect - the only economist to have been so honouredby the RBI.  Incidentally, Lord Meghnad Desai delivered the first lecture whichwas presided over by late Dr. I.G. Patel.  In my valedictory address,  I hadelaborated the Reserve Bank's close links with the fraternity of economistsand hence, will not revisit the theme today.  My address today focuses on thegrowing importance of productivity in the Indian economy, while also alludingto the Reserve Bank's own contribution to enhancing productivity in oureconomy.It is well known that economic growth, as a means to enhancing thewelfare of people, depends both on the use of factors of production such ascapital and labour, and the efficiency in resource use, often referred to asproductivity.  Recent developments indicate the growing importance ofproductivity, particularly for our economy at its present stage of development.                                             ? Inaugural address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at the AnnualConference of Indian Economic Association held on December 27, 2005 at Andhra University,Visakhapatnam. Dr. Reddy is thankful to Dr. Narendra Jadhav and Mr. Muneesh Kapur fortheir valuable assistance rendered at very short notice.Trade integration amongst the countries, that is driven more by thetechnological developments than by the public policy, has the overall effect ofrewarding those with high and increasing productivity. In fact, recentexperience shows that, even in the industrialised economies, a public policythat attempts to protect less-than-competitive productive employment may notsucceed and even when it does to an extent, it is temporary and expensive inthe face of rapid technological change. Such cross-border trade-integrationinduced pressures on productivity have some undeniable positive effects.  Forexample, the price and quality of goods available for consumers aresubstantially determined by the most efficient producers in the world.Productivity gains that get transmitted through trade-integration have positiveeffects on the standard of living as well as the quality of life.The spread and the thrust of Information and CommunicationTechnology (ICT) have provided unprecedented scope for productivity gainsthe world over in a very short span of time.  It is interesting to note that thedeployment of ICT in India may contribute to productivity gains in the USA butnot necessarily to India if the public policy framework does not enableadoption of modern ICT within India. Further, the changes in demography andtheir implications need to be viewed in a global perspective rather than only ina national context. Thus, it is expected that India would contribute to the worlda large young work force in the first half of this century, when the rest of theworld may be getting crowded with an elderly population.  A large young workforce in India is often described as “demographic dividend” but, we mustrecognise that the so called demographic dividend may turn into ademographic nightmare if adequate level of productive employment to ouryouth, in an increasingly globalised environment, is not ensured by anenabling public policy framework.  Finally, before India enters the latter part of21st century, with a large share of the elderly like the rest of the world, wewould have to reckon with the need to provide for the increasingly ageingpopulation.  In other words, the current generation of young persons shouldgrow rich well before they grow old, both on social and economic grounds,since they may not have a younger generation to take care of them.  I hopethe case for focusing on the growing importance of productivity has not beenoverstated by me today.2The text books do provide simple definitions of productivity andtechniques for measurement.  Productivity may be defined as the ratio of theoutput of goods and services to the inputs - human as well as others - used inthe production process. Labour productivity, the best known measure of factorproductivity, reflects the influence of various factors (such as capital, quality oflabour, technological change and organization of production) that affectproductivity. Based on inputs to production, labour productivity can bedecomposed into two components: (a) productivity due to capital deepening(i.e., improvements in physical capital available per labour unit) and (b) multi-factor productivity (MFP) or total factor productivity (TFP). TFP is thecontribution other than that emanating from the increased use of inputs(capital and labour). TFP thus measures the increase in efficiency with whichresources are being used through innovations and improved managementtechniques to increase the output from a given combination of capital andlabour.  Although, conceptually, it is relatively easier to define productivity, itsactual measurement is beset with a number of statistical issues such asaccounting for quality adjustment and non-marketed output such as publicadministration in addition to the underground economy.  In spite of thedifficulties, an accurate measurement of productivity is an imperative, albeitwith full awareness of the limitations of such an exercise.  This is area offruitful research, which the Andhra Pradesh Economic Association may like toconsider.As already mentioned, the main reason for unprecedented productivitygrowth in the recent past has been the impressive technological progress.Robert Solow had emphasised the importance of technological change inlong-term economic growth and productivity way back in the 1950s.  But, thekey issue - what determines technological progress – was left unanswered byassuming technological progress to be exogenous. Technological advanceinvolves the creation of new ideas - partially non-rival and, therefore, havingcertain aspects of public goods – with increasing returns to scale. This,however, conflicts with perfect-competition assumption. These weaknesses ofthe neo-classical model assuming exogenous technological progress wereovercome with the development of the concept of endogenous growthpropounded by Romer and its subsequent refinements in the 1980s. In this3approach, the long-run growth is determined within the model, withtechnological advance benefiting from research and development activity,supported by some monopoly power and increasing returns to scale.Following the research report of the Centre for the Study of LivingStandards (CSLS) in 1998, one can identify the following seven determinantsof productivity growth: the rate of technological progress, investment inphysical capital such as machinery and equipment and structures, the qualityof the workforce, size and quality of the natural resource base, industrialstructure and inter-sectoral shifts, the macroeconomic environment oraggregate demand conditions, and the microeconomic policy environment.Similarly, Harris (1999), based on a review of the cross-country growthliterature, has identified three proximate drivers (the Big Three) of productivitygrowth: investment in machinery and equipment; education, training andhuman capital; and openness to trade and investment. While the proximatedrivers may not be exhaustive, they do point to the critical elements of anenabling public policy for enhancing productivity and employment.What is the role of the ICT in enhancing productivity?  The ICT canhave a positive impact on growth not only through a surge in ICT investment,strong productivity effects from the ICT-producing industries and but alsothrough a more productive use of the ICT in the rest of the economy. The ICTequipments enable new organisational models and other innovations in theproduction process as well as the production of new goods and services.Thus, even if the ICT investment goods are standard products, they enablefirms to innovate and accumulate firm-specific capital with positive spilloverson production.Ark and Inklaar (2005) posit that the ICT investments may have aU-shaped effect on productivity. After some initial benefits from the ICTinvestments (“hard savings”), the contribution may even become negativesince for reaping full benefits of the ICT, complementary investments inhuman and knowledge capital as well as in organisational innovationsbecome necessary. Such complementary investments involve gestation lagsand do not immediately result in an acceleration of productivity growth. It isonly over time that the combination of ICT investment coupled with intangibleinvestments and innovations shows an effect on productivity (“soft savings”),4reflected in the U-shaped relationship. The realisation of “soft savings”involves more trial and error and thus, could benefit from an entrepreneurialenvironment and competitive labour and product markets.There have been several empirical studies on the productivity trendswith special reference to increased use of the ICT and the efficiency gains(For example, Oliver and Sichel, 2002; Nordhans 2005; Ark and Inklaar 2005;Gorden 2004).  The major issues that are addressed relate to the accelerationof productivity since 1995 in the US but not in Europe; the role of the ICT inproductivity acceleration with noticeable differences between the US andEurope seeking explanations for the lagged or indirect effects of the ICT; andthe differences in impact of the  ICT on productivity in the manufacturing vis-à-vis the services sector.  It is not my intention to go into the details of researchbut only to highlight the importance of understanding the role of the ICT insecuring productivity gains, particularly since Andhra Pradesh has been oneof the leading States in the area of ICT.  Hopefully, Andhra Pradesh EconomicAssociation will consider exploring these issues relating to ICT.It will be interesting to recall the empirical work done so far on thetrends in productivity in India.  Most of the empirical studies on productivity inIndia have focussed on the growth in the TFP in the manufacturing sector.These studies suggest a decline in the total factor productivity growth (TFPG)till 1970s, with a turnaround taking place in mid-1980s pursuant to thereoriented trade and industrial policies and improved infrastructureperformance (Brahmananda, 1982; Ahluwalia, 1991; Balakrishnan andPushpangadan, 1994; Majumdar, 1996; Rao, 1996; Pradhan and Barik, 1999;Trivedi, Prakash and Sinate, 2000). The proposition that the TFPGaccelerated during the 1980s would be consistent with the recent contentiousview associated with Rodrik and Subramanian (2004) who have argued thatthe transition to high-growth phase occurred around 1980 – a full decadebefore economic liberalisation - due to pro-business policies that started beingadopted during the 1980s. Various incremental reforms in the industrial sectorduring the 1980s appear to have had a positive impact on the productivityduring the 1980s. However, the pick-up in productivity during the 1980sremains a matter of contention. Balakrishnan and Pushpangadan (1994), forinstance, argue that the turnaround in productivity during the 1980s is the5artefact of using the single-deflation method; there is no evidence of such aturnaround in case       double-deflation approach is adopted: (Under single-deflation method, nominal value added is deflated by an index of the price ofgross output. Under double-deflation method, gross output and material inputare deflated separately by output price index and input price index,respectively, and the difference is treated as real value added).Turning to the trends in productivity in the post-reform period, theevidence from empirical studies by researchers is ambiguous, thoughanecdotal evidence, especially of trends in recent years, shows significantincreases in productivity. While studies by Unel (2003) and Tata Services Ltd.(2003) find an acceleration in the TFPG in the 1990s, Goldar (2004) and RBI(2004) find a deceleration in the TFPG. Notwithstanding the ambiguityregarding acceleration in TFPG, evidence suggests that trade liberalisationsince 1991 has had a positive impact on the TFPG in India (Krishna andMitra, 1998; Chand and Sen, 2002; Das, 2003; and, Topalova, 2004). At thesectoral level, there is evidence of improved TFPG for the exporting sectorsvis-à-vis the non-exporting ones (Dholakia and Kapur, 2001; Unel, 2003).More recently, Kato (2005) finds that the smaller the market share of a firm,the higher is its productivity growth.One limitation of most of the studies in the Indian context is their focuson productivity in only the manufacturing sector. The share of industrial sectorin India’s GDP is only 22 per cent whereas the services sector has emergedas the predominant contributor to GDP with a share of 58 per cent. Since1993-94, the services-sector GDP has recorded an annual average growth ofalmost 8.0 per cent per annum, notably higher than 6.7 per cent recorded bythe industry. Therefore, studies that focus on manufacturing sector alone maynot represent a true picture of productivity of the economy as a whole. This isespecially true in view of some evidence that the productivity acceleration inthe US during the second half of the 1990s was led by the services sector.For India, recently Virmani (2004) has attempted to measure the TFPG for theIndian economy as a whole. His estimates suggest that the TFPG hasfollowed a     V-shaped pattern since independence, with near flattening fromthe late 1980s. Growth in the TFP decelerated since early 1950s, when it wasabout 2.5 per cent, till mid-1970s when it fell to less than 0.5 per cent.6Subsequently, the TFPG recovered and peaked at about 2.6 per cent in 1988-89 and has broadly remained around these levels since then.A second relevant factor in these empirical studies in India is that theirfocus is predominantly on the TFPG. In addition to TFPG, it is important toexamine trends in labour productivity since it is a more proximate measure ofthe standard of living, which is specially relevant for the countries with lowliving standards. Studies in this regard throw some evidence of an increase inthe growth rate of labour productivity during the 1990s [RBI (2004);Balakrishnan and Babu (2003)]. Thus, even if it is held that there has been noclear evidence of growth in the TFP, labour productivity growth could havebeen higher in the post-reforms period, though the evidence is not conclusive.A third factor to be kept in view is that many studies draw upon thedata up to the year 2000 while, by all indications, significant gains inproductivity have occurred in the more recent years, particularly inmanufacturing. Anecdotal evidence, in addition to relevant supporting data ontrends in prices, composition of our export basket and corporate balancesheets, indicates a significant acceleration in productivity gains in theeconomy. These are issues worth exploring for research on a priority basis,including the studies on capital productivity and the movement of theincremental capital-output ratio.How does India fare in comparison with other countries? Cross-countryevidence (Ark and Inklaar, 2005) shows that labour productivity growth inIndia in recent years is better than in Germany, the United Kingdom and theUnited States. Wage rates in India are much lower than in Thailand,Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Korea. In terms of the unit labourcost, India has a competitive edge over Singapore, Korea and Malaysia. Inthe case of the iron and steel industry, India fares better than Hong Kong,Indonesia, and Malaysia, both in terms of lower input costs and higheroperating surplus. India leads in skill-based manufacturing activity such asability to re-engineer equipment at lower capital costs, innovative process re-engineering, availability of skilled technicians and quality mindset. On theother hand, the unit labour cost in India is higher in food products, electricalmachinery and transport equipments as compared with some other emergingmarket economies. Overall, the Global Competitiveness Report 2004 (World7Economic Forum) has ranked India 55th among 104 economies in terms ofthe Growth Competitiveness Index and 30th in terms of BusinessCompetitiveness Index.  Although labour productivity growth in India is higherthan in the advanced economies, it needs to be stressed that its level in Indiaremains quite low in many sectors. Illustratively, productivity per worker inIndia is only nine per cent of the US productivity as compared with fourteenper cent for China (Ark, Bart van 2005).An important issue for India is the relationship between productivity andemployment. Does higher productivity lead to a reduction in employment?Prima facie, the evidence may appear to support such a proposition but itmight require a deeper analysis. Illustratively, in the US productivity hasrebounded in the last decade while manufacturing employment has declinedsharply. Such a simple positive correlation might be deceptive as it ignoresproductivity trends in the competing economies. It could be the case thatproductivity in competitor countries might have exceeded that in the US. It ispossible that the effects of rapid domestic productivity growth could havebeen more than offset by more rapid productivity growth and price declinesarising from foreign competitors. Indeed, this appears to have been the casesince, according to estimates by Nordhaus (2005), the relevant elasticities ofemployment with respect to productivity – about 0.25 to 0.5 - indicate thatfaster productivity growth leads to increased rather than decreasedemployment in manufacturing. In brief, the implications of productivity trendson employment in our country depend not merely on what happens withinIndia but what happens in other countries contemporaneously, reaffirming theimportance of tracking productivity both in India as well as in other countries,in view of trade integration.  I would flag this as another priority area forresearch by the economists.While a number of studies have examined the relationship betweenproductivity and income on the one hand and between income and poverty onthe other, the relationship between productivity and poverty is perhapsrelatively less explored. A number of studies have found that productivitygrowth has a positive impact on income growth. Sustained and high growth, inturn, is found to reduce poverty levels in an economy. Thus, it is expected thatproductivity growth should also have a positive effect of reducing poverty in an8economy, although the very short-run effect may be ambiguous dependingupon the effect of productivity growth on employment. While in the long-run,productivity growth is employment enhancing, the short-run effect could beemployment-diminishing, if redeployment of labour is rendered difficult.Hence, a labour force supported by adequate human capital skills and robustgovernance institutions can help reaping the benefits of productivity growth onemployment more rapidly.  It must be noted that an inverse relationshipbetween productivity growth and employment may, in fact, hold in the long-runat a sectoral level (say, agriculture), but at the economy-wide levels, a positiverelationship is expected as employment opportunities arise in newer industriesand the services sector.On the whole, productivity growth can have positive impact on povertyreduction through two channels: First, increase in productivity raises wagesand incomes and hence reduces poverty. Higher productivity-led wages andincomes can have a second-round impact on domestic demand and, in turn,on employment and further gains on poverty reduction. Second, productivitygains help to moderate the rate of increase in prices – as has been happeningin a number of countries. Lower inflation is equivalent to an increase in thepurchasing power of current incomes. This indirect effect, operating throughlower inflation, can also have a mitigating effect on poverty levels.A detailed analysis of the relationship between productivity and povertyhas recently been made by the International Labour Organisation in itspublication World Employment Report, 2004-05 (WER). Cross-countryempirical analysis contained in the Report shows that poverty reduction isoften, but not always, the mirror image of productivity gains. Productivitygrowth can and must go hand in hand with employment creation and povertyreduction, at least in the long run. But, as the Report stresses, this does notoccur automatically and in the same way for all regions. For the beneficialeffects of productivity growth to be reaped, economies require a certaindegree of productivity growth in order to improve labour market conditions.Major transitions or crises can have a negative impact on productivity growthand labour markets need time to recover. A recent study [CSLS (2003)] findsthat productivity growth accounts for changes in poverty better than the morecommonly used economic growth. According to the study, in countries with9the lowest GINI indices, a one per cent rise in labour productivity is associatedwith a 1.02 per cent decline in the incidence of poverty. In countries with thehighest GINI indices, the impact is less than a half: a one per cent rise inlabour productivity was associated with only a 0.45 per cent decline in theincidence of poverty. It appears that the effects of productivity growth onpoverty depend inversely upon the income inequality levels: the higher isincome inequality within a country, the more limited is the impact ofproductivity growth on reducing poverty. On the other hand, the effect ofproductivity growth on poverty reduction is found to be stronger in countrieswith relatively low income inequality.  I would end this exploratory journey onrelationship between productivity growth and poverty reduction with anexhortation that economic research in this area should be a priority in Indiasince poverty alleviation is the biggest challenge while increase in productivityis a necessary though not a sufficient condition for poverty eradication.Before concluding, it is appropriate that there be some illustrations ofthe manner in which Reserve Bank has been contributing to enhancingproductivity in our economy.The first and foremost contribution is the lowering of inflation and moreimportantly, inflation expectations. A growing consensus has emerged inrecent times, both in academia and policy circles, that price stability - a lowand stable inflation rate - provides substantial benefits to the economy.  First,it prevents over-investment in the financial sector.  Second, price stabilitylowers the uncertainty about relative prices and the future price level, makingit easier for firms and individuals to make appropriate decisions, therebyincreasing economic efficiency.  Third, price stability also lowers thedistortions from the interaction of the tax system and inflation.  All of thesebenefits of price stability suggest that by anchoring inflationary expectations, astable inflation can increase the level of resources productively employed inthe economy.  In the Indian context, the Reserve Bank exhibits demonstrablecommitment to price stability and growth, the relative emphasis beingdetermined by the balance of domestic and global conditions. Measured interms of Wholesale Price Index (WPI), the annual rate of inflation halved froman average of around 11 per cent over the 5-year period beginning 1990-91 toaround 5 per cent for the first five years of the current decade.  This, as you10would all agree, has been an important factor for business to thrive andprosper, with positive spillovers on productivity improvements.Second, the ease of credit availability is a crucial ingredient forbusiness to flourish.  A growing economy needs to have access to credit onreasonable terms and conditions.  Illustratively, the credit growth over the lastfive years has averaged 20 per cent, with the increase at around 25 per centbeing particularly rapid during the last three years, riding on the back ofbroad-based credit demand across all sectors.  In recognition of these facts,recent policies have placed explicit emphasis on streamlining credit deliveryconsistent with credit quality through a gamut of measures. Any discussion ofproductivity improvement needs to take on board the reach of the financialsector, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas.  It is in this context that therecent Policy Statements of the Reserve Bank have rationalised branchlicensing policy and emphasized the need for 'financial inclusion' of the vastsegment of our population who have hitherto remained financially excluded.Self-help groups formed by non-government organisations (NGOs) andfinanced by banks represent an important constituent of this developmentprocess.Third, the policy environment has been made conducive for Indiancorporates to have global presence, including global acquisitions. Inparticular, the corporates are free to leverage through external commercialborrowings and Indian banks are enabled to fund such presence. Theseinitiatives help exploitation of synergies of the domestic and foreign operationsof our corporates thus enhancing overall productivity.Fourth, as regards banking sector, Professor T.T. Ram Mohan hasdescribed succinctly (Economic Times, December 15, 2005) the currentstatus in this regard.  "There is the improved efficiency and stability of Indianbanking.  Banking has proved the soft underbelly of many an experiment inliberalisation.  Not so in India.  The decline in interest rates in recent yearshelped recapitalise the banking system.  Now, the system is well placed totake advantage of this good fortune - both by garnering more savings and bydelivering more credit.  With financial markets having developed as well, thefinancial system is geared to meet the demands of growth".11Fifth, improvements in communication policy of Reserve Bank alsohave an indirect influence on productivity.  For instance, the Reserve Bankhas brought about changes in the institutional setting of the monetary policyby migrating from half-yearly announcements to a system of quarterly reviewssince April 2005.  The weight of evidence suggests that increasingtransparency and accountability reduces the uncertainty about monetarypolicy, interest rates and inflation. The consequent conducive economicenvironment makes it easier for businesses to flourish.  The Reserve Bankhas, therefore, been making pro-active efforts to improve transparency andpublic availability of information. Such information dissemination leads tominimisation of uncertainties about policy intentions, enhances marketstability and has a long-run positive effect on productivity. Of particularinterest to this gathering may be the data available on the website of ReserveBank through the "Database on Indian Economy" (available athttps://reservebank.org.in).  The website is being currently accessedextensively by market analysts and economic researchers from universities inthe USA and the UK.Finally, Reserve Bank has been interacting with market participantswhile being alert to the global developments in order to ensure financialstability since there is a clear global recognition of the disruptive effects offinancial instability. India has been spared both currency and banking crises,unlike many other emerging countries. Further, amongst the major economiesthat do not contribute to current global imbalances, India and Euro area arenoteworthy. It is widely recognised that the financial sector and the externalsector reforms are amongst the most successful in India which also reflectsthe enabling conditions ensured by Reserve Bank for efficiency and stability.It must be recognised that stability has enabled acceleration of growth rates,notwithstanding the significant borrowing requirements of the public sectorincluding the Government  and the infrastructural challenges.  From the perspective of the monetary policy formulation by theReserve Bank, an understanding of the underlying trends in productivity is ofcritical importance in order to aim for low and stable inflation. Ultimately,inflation is determined by mismatches between demand and supply in theeconomy. Monetary authorities, therefore, ought to have a good fix on the12movements in the trends in the economy’s productivity since it is a keydeterminant of the potential growth of the economy. If the productivity of theeconomy is on an uptrend – that is, the potential growth of the economy hasmoved on to a higher trajectory – that would suggest, ceteris paribus, that thesupply exceeds the demand in the economy and hence, it provides monetarypolicy flexibility to pursue an accommodative monetary policy without stokinginflationary pressures. From the view point of the conduct of the monetarypolicy, it is important to have reliable estimates of the evolving productivitydynamics, but it is critical to be able to form such assessments on a timelybasis to avoid costly errors. Thus, for a central bank to deliver low and stableinflation while allowing employment and output close to their potential/naturallevels, analysis of productivity – on a real time basis – remains a key input.Let me conclude : Reserve Bank has a vital interest in research andanalysis of productivity trends in the Indian economy, on a continuing basisand in a timely manner,  keeping in view similar developments in other majoreconomies in the world.I have great pleasure in inaugurating the Annual Conference and wishthe Conference all success.  We, in the Reserve Bank, look forward to theguidance that we could get from the scholarly pursuits and deliberations inthis Conference.Thank you.---x---13Select ReferencesAhluwalia, I.J., "Productivity and Growth in Indian Manufacturing", OxfordUniversity Press, New Delhi, 1991.Ark, Bart van and Robert Inklaar, "Catching Up or Getting Stuck?
