Communications in Central Banks: A Perspective*Rakesh MohanI. IntroductionCommunication is part of the professional hazards that central bankers face as aroutine. The responses as well as measures are mostly ‘measured’. Financial marketswatch our pauses, and some punctuation marks in the text of a statement have thedistinct possibility of getting transmitted through the movement of a few points in theyield curve. Faced with such grave consequences that can be measured in millions ofrupees or dollars, communication in central banking becomes really a very seriousmatter.Is it true for central banking only?  Perhaps not: after all, communication ingeneral is a complex process. While we all attempt to communicate among ourselves allthe time, nonetheless, the expression of intentions in oral or written mode often do notget transmitted correctly to the reader or listener. Words have different connotations - sohave paragraphs or lengthy documents.  The reader or listener often ascribes motives toexpressions used and a wedge is created between what is said and what is perceived.What a person perceives is often very dependent on what she expects to hear, or shewants to hear.  It interesting to refer to what William Poole has noted in context ofcentral bank communication,“Accurate communication requires settled meanings for words. For any givenword, we can consult a dictionary and we usually discover that each Englishword has several meanings, which can be quite different. There is no dictionaryin which we can look up the several meanings of a paragraph. The meaning of apolicy statement —  preferably only one — must be established by the centralbank, through consistent practice over time and through more extendeddiscussion of what the language means” (Poole, 2003).Furthermore, expression of intention is not a one-off affair; on the contrary thereare elements of incrementality in communication and reputation plays a role.Illustratively, my children often start reacting to any directions only after a reminder:their normal reaction to my directions is to see whether I was serious to begin with. Mycredibility is constantly at stake.Communication in central banking is a far more difficult process. It is not thatlong ago that central banking was shrouded in mystery. Books like “Secrets of theTemple” (Greider, 1989), and expressions like “monetary mystique” (Goodfreind, 1985)bear testimony to this.  It was in fact widely believed that communication from theCentral Bank needs to be couched in terms of “constructive ambiguity”, a term coinedby Chairman Gerry Corrigan of the New York Fed. One is reminded of what AlanGreenspan said, “The undeniable, though regrettable, fact is that the most effectivepolicymaking is done outside the immediate glare of the press" (Greenspan, 2002).It was felt that earlier that policy effectiveness depended on the degree ofsurprise with which the market was taken by central bank policy announcements. In fact,it is quite remarkable to note that prior to 1994 the target Federal Funds Rate was noteven announced by the US Federal Reserve: the market was left to infer the rate fromthe timing, sequence and magnitude of its open market operations (Woodford, 2005).Now, however, the U.S. Federal Reserve not only announces its current target FedFund Rate but also provides a clear indication of the likely trajectory of future interest                                                * Address by Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, for the SAARCFINANCE Governors’Symposium in Mumbai, September 9, 2005. The assistance of Partha Ray in preparation of theaddress is gratefully acknowledged.  The usual disclaimer applies.rates. Such has been the revolution in Central Bank communication practice over thelast ten to fifteen years.Since the late 1980s and early 1990s the widely perceived iron wall of centralbanks’ communication has become much thinner, along with the fall of the iron curtain.From the current vantage point we can clearly discern three reasons for this change:• First, the clamour for and attainment of central bank independence has imposeda great degree of responsibility on the central banks – a major one being theattainment of transparency in communication.• Second, adoption of inflation targeting by a number of central banks since the1990s made effective communication an integral part of policy making. Monetarypolicy committees were formed and minutes started being published.• Third, the innovations in information and communication technology made thespeed and form of communication from central banks quite revolutionary.  Fromthe print medium and television the new entrants of transmission have been theweb-sites of the central banks and the wire agencies like Reuters andBloomberg.This change in thinking has occurred with the enhanced perception that "centralbanks affect the economy as much through their influence on expectations as throughany direct, mechanical effects of central bank trading in the market for overnight cash"(Woodford, 2005), or through their specific announcements on the intervention  rate.Woodford goes as far as to say that "Central Banking is management of expectations".When a central bank changes its intervention / policy rate, its effectiveness ininfluencing key variables such as the inflation rate depends crucially on its effect onother financial market prices such as the exchange rate, equity prices and the longerterm interest rates. Thus, apart from the specific action related to the overnight policyrate, the central bank has to use all the means at its disposal to achieve its policy aims.Now that direct credit controls, or other quantitative direct instrument are not available,and that financial markets have deepened even in our countries, effectivecommunicative of central bank policy objectives, instruments and action has gainedprominence.In fact, presently there is now perhaps an abundance of information that getstransmitted from the Central Banks to the public. This goes to the extent that theEconomist (July 22, 2004) recently raised the question: “Do communicative centralbanks make financial markets lazy?” and concluded that, “It’s not always good to talk.”The issue at hand for our countries relates to our understanding of the depth andsophistication of our financial markets and of the public at large. Should ourcommunication strategies be similar to that of our counterparts in more developedcountries? Should our mode of monetary policy making, e.g. inflation targeting, besimilar to the current vogue elsewhere? How confident can we be of our powers ofmodeling and forecasting? These are the questions that we have to deal with and tothen fashion our communication strategies accordingly.It is in this context that I attempt to review the rationale, forms and practices ofcommunication in central banking and try to evaluate the Indian experience in thisaddress. The rest of the address is orgranised as follows. Section II looks into thegeneral issues relating of communication in central banks. Section III presents theIndian practices and some of my personal reflections in this regard. Section IV gives theconcluding observations.II. Necessity of Communication from the Central BankersThe issue of communication in central banks is intimately interlinked with themandate of the central bank. The more complex is the mandate of the central bank, themore difficult as well as more important is the communication. Illustratively, if themandate of the central bank is either inflation targeting or exchange rate targeting (as ina currency board arrangement) then the objective of central bank is amply clear to thepublic. Hence communication is necessary to express the commitment of the centralbank which is reflected through continuous action to maintain its credibility for achievingthese objectives. On the contrary, if the mandate is complex as it is, for example, for theUS Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of India, then the objectives may not beclear. Moreover, even if the objectives are known, when there are multiple objectivesthere could be lack of clarity among the relative weights and the changing relativeweights of these objectives. In all such cases, the central bank needs to communicatethe objectives on a continuous basis. Thus, benefit of central bank communicationdepends crucially on the adopted policy approach (Bernanke, 2004). Specifically if thecentral bank follows a simple feedback policy, then the private sector can easily infer itsfuture policies. In that case, there is no necessity of extensive communication by thecentral bank except when the central bank decides to deviate substantially from the rule.Central bankers in modern times hardly follow a simple feedback rule – all centralbanks, including the inflation targetors, take into account a wealth of information indeciding the future course of monetary policy and follow what is termed as the ‘forecast-based approach’. In this case, the public are not able to infer the likely course of policyso easily and need guidance about the central bank’s perception of outlooks, riskassessments, and objectives. Clear and transparent communication plays an importantrole in this case.The need for communication from the central banks also comes from anotherdistinct source. Since the early 1990s, there is an increasing emphasis on central bankindependence. In a democratic polity, a good deal of trust is placed in the central bank.Various countries in the world have attained varying degrees of independence of theircentral banks. In this context, questions of accountability and transparency are often1raised. Communication is at the heart of accountability. There is, thus, a need tounderstand motives and procedures. When the political authorities give a clear mandateto the central banks in bestowing independence then the communication policy of thecentral bank is reasonably clear.  A crucial issue about communication policy is whenand whom to communicate. Interestingly, when a central bank is not independent, thenit can communicate only to the controlling authority.  In case of an independent centralbank the communication has to go to various actors, viz., (a) public, (b) legislature orexecutive, (c) market participants. The mode and method of communication to theparticipants would be distinctly different for these three entities.In a globalised world, it is not possible to formulate monetary policy independentof international developments. Monetary policy formulation has, thus, became morecomplex and interdependent (Mohan, 2002). Furthermore, in a globalised world withincreasing communication from the regulatory clubs like BIS or IMF, sophistication of thestaff is perhaps not too different among the countries.  The question, however, is: howsophisticated is the audience in understanding delicate nuances of the announcementsof the central banks. In fact, the effectiveness of monetary policy will crucially depend onhow well the public and market participants understand the central bank signals. Arelated question is: do the central banks need to communicate to different agentsdifferently? What is good for the public may not be good for the market participants.                                                1 As for example, a CEPR document visualized the Bank of England as “independent andaccountable” [Roll and others (1993)].After all, “the markets thrive on volatility, while the public dislike it quite intensely”(Blinder et al., 2000).Monetary policy is most effective when markets anticipate it correctly. Thus, ageneral consensus in the literature is that more is the transparency, better it is. Moreopen public disclosure of central bank policies may enhance the efficiency of markets,through the following two channels:• First, greater information about how a central bank makes policy decisions helpsto reduce financial speculation.• Second, clearer decision rules help to reduce the volatility of markets, and, thus,enhance the predictability of future movements of financial assets.Furthermore, as the rational expectations literature has taught us that the effectsof a given policy action have to be defined within a treatment of policy expectations. It isargued that an assumption about public understanding of the future course of policy is aprecondition for any coherent analysis of current policy. Monetary policy is no exceptionto this general rule. Besides, this literature also showed that monetary authorities cannotutilize the short-run trade-off by “fooling” the public systemically, and therebyestablished the necessity of transparency in communication of central banks.The forex market, because of its special nature, could be an exception to thisgeneral rule of ‘more the merrier’ in case of transparency. Communication in the area ofexchange rate policy is special due to a number of reasons (Blinder et al., 2000). First,apart from central banks, governments in a number of cases have joint responsibility forexchange rate policy.  Second, in case of some exchange rate arrangements (such as,pure pegs and pure floats), the need for central bank communication is absent.  Third, inthe some instances where central banks decide to intervene in the foreign exchangemarket in pursuit of monetary goals, secrecy may be defensible on the grounds ofeffectiveness. I shall turn to this issue in the Indian context in somewhat greater detail.Another general issue is despite the multiplicity of objectives there is only oneinstrument with the central banks, viz., a variant of the short term interest rate. Centralbanks all over the world try to change the short term interest rates on the assumptionthat it will influence the medium and long term interest rates - after all it is the mediumand long term rates that affect expectations and asset prices (Blinder, 1998). To a largeextent, this happens through explanations or forecasts. The effectiveness of these willcrucially depend on the degree of sophistication of the financial market participants andthe interlocutors.The extent of transparency in central bank communication has been dictated bythe norms of openness in the body-politic as well. Illustratively,   Bank of England(BoE)’s information dissemination is governed by the Freedom of Information Act 2000of the U.K. This Act places an obligation on public authorities to adopt and maintain apublication scheme. Furthermore, with effect from January 2005, the Act provides ageneral right of access to all types of recorded information held by public authorities andsets out exemptions from that right. Similarly, in the U.S, as per the Freedom ofInformation Act one can request information from the Fed.Do central banks talk in an obscure language? Is communication an exercise inobfuscation? Many of the central banks have traditionally been portrayed as ‘tight-lipped, secretive, and cryptic’.  It is often alleged that central bank executives usecomplicated words to convey little meaning. Blinder and others have alleged that,“Chairman Alan Greenspan is credited with raising Fedspeak to a high art … evencharacterizing his own way of communicating as mumbling with great incoherence”(Blinder et al, 2000). In one particular incident, Chairman Greenspan is reported to havetold a US senator, who claimed to have understood what the chairman had just said,that “in that case, I must have misspoken”.Notwithstanding such allegations, there have been great moves in fosteringtransparency in central communication in recent years. A case in point is the publicationof minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. According to theBank of England Act, 1998, the BoE is supposed to "publish minutes of the MPCmeeting before the end of the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day of the meeting."Until October 1998 the minutes were published about five weeks after the meeting. TheMonetary Policy Committee announced in 1998 that it would publish the minutes of itsmonthly meetings on the Wednesday of the second week after the meetings take place.Apart from the Minutes, they publish the voting pattern of the individual members aswell.Besides, central banks are increasingly learning to communicate ‘perception ofuncertainty’, as different from ‘ambiguity’. In terms of communication there are variousways to tell the public that ‘we do not know for certain’, which are clearly preferable tocouching a statement in ambiguous language. Illustratively, the BoE publishes itsgrowth or inflation forecasts with a differing margin of error – what is popularly called the“fan chart”.  The fan chart with its increasing lighter shade (at the outward direction) is amode which clearly communicates the extent of uncertainty and the degree of ignoranceof the forecaster.Another important hallmark of modern communication is the emerging roles ofweb-sites and wire agencies. While the speed of communication is still slightly slowerthan light, wire agencies put the communication from the central banks on an almostreal time basis. This has great ramifications on the transmission of news and formationof expectation in the financial markets.Having delineated the general principles let me now turn to the Indian specificson central bank communication.III. Communication in RBII have already pointed out that more complex is the mandate for the central bankmore is the necessity of communication. The Indian case would perhaps approximatethat of a complex objective. After all, apart from pursuing monetary policy, financialstability is one of the overriding concerns of the RBI. Within the objective of monetarypolicy, both control of inflation and providing adequate credit to the productive sectors ofthe economy so as to foster growth are equally important. This apart, Reserve Bankacts as a banking regulator, debt manager, government debt market regulator andcurrency issuer. Faced with such multiple tasks and complex mandate, there is anutmost necessity of clearer communication on the part of the Reserve Bank of India.What do we need to communicate? In a central bank, there is necessity of threekinds of communication, viz., (a) policy measures, (b) reasons behind such policymeasures and (c) analysis of the economy. RBI is engaged with all these three kinds ofcommunication. In fact, by international standards the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hasa fairly extensive and transparent communication system.  The bi-annual policystatements have traditionally communicated the Reserve Bank’s stands on monetarypolicy in the immediate future of six months to one year.  As of July this year, we havenow begun a system of quarterly reviews in addition to the bi-annual statements.  Thepresent practice of attaching a review of macro economic developments to the annualpolicy and mid term review, and to the quarterly reviews gives an expansive view of howthe central bank sees the economy. In the bi-annual policy meetings with the leadingbankers, the Governor while announcing the policy explains the rationale behind themeasures at length.  These policy meetings are not one-way traffic.  Each bankerpresent in the meeting interacts with the Governor to express his or her reaction to thepolicy announcement.  After the policy announcement is over, the Governor addressesa press conference in the afternoon. The Deputy Governor in–charge of the MonetaryPolicy Department normally gives live interviews to all the major television channels onthe same day. Governor also gives interviews to print and electronic media over the nextfew days after the monetary policy announcement. The only thing we still do not have isa live telecast of Governor’s monetary policy announcements.Apart from these policy statements communication of RBI policy takes placethrough speeches of the Governor and Deputy Governors.  These speeches aredevoted to issues concerning the economy as well as articulation of the RBI’s policies.Interestingly, globally it has been found that the speeches of the Governors of thecentral banks have been an important determinant of the movement of the termstructure of interest rates as changes in the repo rate (Fracasso, Genberg and Wyplosz,2003).The typical mode in which RBI’s policy is communicated to the regulated entitiesis departmental circulars.  Depending on the domain of operations the concerneddepartment will issue a circular which then is placed in the website without any delay.  Atypical complaint about the circulars is often that they are written in the language that isnot easily comprehensible, and one needs to translate them into normal understandablelanguage. But that is a complaint against any formal statement couched in semi-legallanguage.  I do believe, however, that we can all do a much better job of writing circularsin plain English shorn of tedious jargon.The other major mode of dissemination of RBI policy as well as its views on theeconomy is its Reports. Over the years these Reports have turned out to be moreanalytical, transparent and forward looking in their outlook. The two statutory reports ofthe Bank, the Annual Report and the Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in Indiahave evoked immense interest among the public, market participants as well as inacademia.  The theme based Report on Currency and Finance is a platform to articulatethe research findings on an issue of topical interest. RBI Occasional Papers has alsoemerged as a professional journal of refereed research output of the RBI staff.Over the years Committee Reports have emerged as another plank ofcommunication from RBI. The plethora of committees formed by the RBI tries tocommunicate to the financial sector participants or markets.  Interestingly, many ofthese committees are conceptualized during the process of either the annual or the mid-year Review of monetary policy, so that by the time of the next policy itsrecommendations are available for consideration or for implementation. While thegeneral public is quite cynical about the formation of any committee, as long as theauthorities are serious about a transparent acceptance or rejection of therecommendations of the committees, they remain a major vehicle of the collective policythinking.An important feature of the RBI communication policy is the almost real-timedissemination of information through its web-site. The results of the Liquidity AdjustmentFacility (LAF) of the day are posted in the web-site by 12.30 P.M of the same day, by2.30 P.M the reference rates numbers are also placed in the web-site. By the next daymorning the press release on money market operations are out. Every Saturday by 12noon the weekly statistical supplement is placed in the web-site, giving a fairly detailedrecent data-base on the RBI and the financial sector. By the first of every month, theRBI Bulletin of the month is out. All the regulatory and administrative circulars ofdifferent Departments are placed on the web-site within half an hour of its finalization. Ithink such a high speed of dissemination is possible due to the professional skills of theinternal staff of the RBI.Another significant step towards transparency of monetary policy implementationis formation of various Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) in the RBI withrepresentatives from market participants, other regulators (like SEBI or IRDA) andexperts. Over the years, three such Technical Advisory committees have emerged –one on the money, forex and G-Sec markets, the other on regulation, and a recent oneon monetary policy. These fora act as platforms where RBI comes to know about theneeds of market players and where the RBI is able to communicate its stand on theseissues that may not be strictly feasible in the formal modes of circulars. Many of theagenda notes prepared for these meetings form the background of the bi-annualmonetary policy announcements. These apart, the Resource Management Discussionsbefore the Annual Policy act as another mode of a two-way communication betweenmanagement of commercial banks and RBI management.  Meeting with the StateFinance Secretaries is another platform of communication.I have tried to give a quick run-down of the various means and modes ofcommunication strategy and policy of the RBI. Needless to say, in tune with the globaltrends the RBI too has become more transparent, articulate and fast in communicatingits policies and views on the economy. Nevertheless, questions remain.  What elsecould have been done? Could the RBI have done better? What are impediments andhazards of communication in a central bank? How fast does the market react to centralbank’s announcements? Let me now turn to some of these issues.How fast does the central bank communication influence the market? Aninteresting illustration of the impact of central bank communication is perhaps theepisode in stock market on May 17, 2004. On this day, in the wake of change ofGovernment, stock markets in India witnessed a record fall in price, which triggered theindex-based circuit breaker twice during the day. The index-based circuit breakertriggered for the first time at 10:16 AM when the Sensex touched a low of 4516. Whentrading resumed after one hour at 11:15 AM, the Sensex opened at 4448 beforetouching the day's low of 4227 at 11:19 AM – which triggered the circuit breaker foraround two hours. In normal circumstances, the Reserve Bank does not take a viewabout the stock market. However, when confronted with the possibility of a spill-over inmoney, G-Sec and forex markets RBI intervened on that day and two separate pressreleases were issued by the Bank indicating, (a) constitution of an internal Task Forceunder the Executive Director, Financial Market Committee to monitor the developmentsin financial markets, and (b) assuring availability of Rupee and Forex Liquidity (Annex).Thus, it was communicated that RBI was keeping in touch with major settlement banksand the stock exchanges to ensure that payment obligations on the exchanges weremet and gave assurance of selling dollars through agent banks in order to augmentsupply or intervene directly to meet any demand supply imbalances. These pressreleases were placed on the web-site around 2.00 P.M, but were released to wireagencies half an hour earlier and were flashed in all the tickers by 1.30 P.M. Tradinghad resumed by that time at 1:16 PM; subsequent to the flashing of the press release,the market witnessed a quick recovery, before closing at 4505.  Whereas I am notclaiming the entire recovery in the sensex on that day to be solely due to thecommunication from the RBI, it is important to understand the role and power of suchcommunications when there are occasions when central bank communication can haveimmediate impact on the market - that too on a market that is not strictly under itsjurisdiction.Central Bank communication has its flip side too. The modern day paparazzi-syndrome haunts central bankers as well. I am sure that many of the central bankersmust have at some point of time must have bitterly surprised to find in the next day’snewspaper some statement that was ascribed to him or her – whereas the truth couldbe entirely opposite. Let me illustrate this with a personal experience – one among thefew I have experienced during my stay in RBI. On August 14, 2004 I was at the AnnualCitibank-Fitch Debt Market Conference. On my entry I was chased by the journalistsand one of the questions I was asked was about the future rate of inflation. To the bestof my recollection I said that the present rise in inflation was predominantly driven bysupply-shocks and that we were monitoring the developments carefully. To my uttersurprise, a pink paper in the next day (i.e., August 15, 2004) reported a story with thephotographs of the President of India and mine side by side, with the following catchlines:• “President APJ Abdul Kalam said on Saturday that sustaining a high eight percent growth and containing inflation, now at 7.61 per cent, were the majorchallenges for the country.”• “Meanwhile, Reserve Bank (RBI) deputy governor Rakesh Mohan on Saturdayreiterated that the authorities were expecting inflation to fall to the earlier levelsof five per cent.”The story implied that a Deputy Governor of the RBI differed with the Presidentof India on the stance of inflation on the eve of the Independence Day! However, I wasabsolutely in a catch-22 situation and was unable to issue a letter of protest as it wouldhave given the signal that the RBI is expecting the inflation to go up. Such are thetravails of central bank communication!Similar experience is often found in interpretation of various reports and policystatements. I am told that in recent years, the Bank of Canada has instituted a media“lock-up” arrangement in which the media can read key reports of the Bank of Canadaand write their stories prior to the official publication time. There are regular mediabriefings during this lock-up period, where officials can deal with technical questions andclarify other issues (purely on an unattributed basis) for the media. In Canada suchpractice have resulted in a clear improvement in the in the quality of the reporting. I amaware that in RBI as well, the Reports are released to the media a day earlier to therelease date but without any technical briefing. Perhaps we can think of introducing thismedia lock-up arrangement inclusive of technical briefing in RBI. This could reduce thework of issuing rejoinders about some perceived misgiving on central bank policies.In common parlance, often central communication is seen in an insider-outsidercontext. It is assumed that central bank communication refers to what the central bankchooses to tell the general public, market participants, experts, or the media.  Whathappens to the communication internally? Or, to borrow from the management literature,how do we “sell the brand inside” (Mitchell, 2001)? While information is doled to theemployees in form of memos, news letter, many an occasion the employees of anorganization are unable to realize the uniqueness of the brand. Central banks are noexception to this general trend of the corporate world.  The policy and research wings ofthe RBI would need to pay particular attention to the dissemination and effectivecommunication of the RBI policies to internal staff and play a pro-active role. I putforward the following ideas in this context:• It would be useful in this context to arrange internal seminars / talks in allregional offices and training colleges of the RBI after monetary policyannouncements or publication of important Reports – whether regular (e.g.,Annual Report or Report on Currency & Finance) or Committee Reports.• Another idea could be to release FAQs (frequently asked questions) on anypolicy matter in the website. There could be educational resources as well asdone in FED (such as, “In Plain English: Making Sense of the Federal Reserve”,or material on personal financial education).• Still another idea could be to introduce a working paper series with a cleardisclaimer that ‘these are the finding of the individual researcher and not of theRBI’. The unfortunate thing about the domestic Press is that they often choose todisregard the disclaimer, and start ascribing any research finding to the RBI.• Finally, many of the internal notes of various departments are of immenseanalytical value; subject to the caveats of confidentiality (which I am sure wouldbe exceptions rather than rules), many such notes could be made availableinternally. Departmental sites in the RBI Intranet could be effectively utilized inthis.While the management normally makes policy statements to the outside world, in anincreasingly liberalizing economy, staffs often act as ambassadors of the institution – inthat sense internal communication could act as a conduit for external communication aswell.A look at the communication policy of the central banks in advanced countriesbrings out two important features. Many of the central banks have a monetary policycommittee with some form or the other, and many of them have an inflation report and afinancial stability report. The question is how far do we need them? While the InflationReport is a hallmark of many inflation targeting economies, it is by no means universal –the same is also true for financial stability report. Nevertheless, a critical question in thiscontext is publication of the central bank’s forecasts. Almost all central banks havesome internal forecasts about the inflation and growth rate of the economy. The inflationtargeting countries tend to attach heavy emphasis on the publication of forecasts. Theseforecasts are based on some economic models, and buttressed by the policy maker’sexpectation of future. Thus, when and if, we think in favour of introducing an inflationreport for India, we need to sort out the prerequisite of a detailed macro model as wellas commitment to a band of inflation – not just a point of time (which in any way isannounced in the bi-annual policy statements), bur a path for the year(s) to come. As faras financial stability report is concerned, it is heartening to note that Report on Trendand Progress of Banking in India, 2003-04 has introduced a chapter on this topic. As theReport on Trend and Progress of Banking in India is a statutory report, the questionarises whether we need to introduce an additional financial stability report, or we needto couch the contents of this report suitably, so that it effectively becomes the financialstability report.As far as the monetary policy committees are concerned, it may be noted thatthe Advisory Group on ‘Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies’ (for theStanding Committee on International Financial Standards and Codes), with   Shri   M.Narasimham as  Chairman and Shri S.S. Tarapore as a member, recommended settingup of a monetary policy committee in RBI.Consequently, in order to further strengthen the consultative process inmonetary policy, the RBI has set up a Technical Advisory Committee on MonetaryPolicy in July 2005 with external experts in the areas of monetary economics, centralbanking, financial markets and public finance. The Technical Advisory Committeecomprises the Governor as the Chairman, the Deputy Governor in charge of MonetaryPolicy as an internal member, and four external members in the committee. OtherDeputy Governor(s) and any expert depending on the requirement of the subject will bespecial invitees. The Committee would meet at least once in a quarter. The TechnicalAdvisory Committee is a right step towards enhanced transparency for communicationfrom the RBI.IV. Concluding ObservationsCentral Bank communication has come a long way. From the secretive centralbankers, allegations are now made that they are talking too much. Central banks havebecome more transparent and today there is abundance of material about the centralbanks’ intended action plan.What is the message then? While nobody doubts that necessity andtransparency of central banks communication, the question is how do we go about it? Inconclusion, I can do no better but to quote from Adam Posen of the Institute ofInternational Economics, who succinctly summarized the need for central bankcommunication:“Think of the relationship between a central bank and the attentive public asanalogous to the relationship between a married couple. Goodcommunication is key if the relationship is to cope well with the bumps andbruises of everyday life. While familiarity removes the need for too muchexplicitness in communication, changing surroundings and personal needsover time make it dangerous to take too much previous understanding forgranted. Presumably, the relationship is for the long-term, and day-to-daymisunderstandings do not imperil the relationship, but they can make it lesspleasant or mutually beneficial" (Posen, 2002, p. 3).AnnexTwo Press Releases from the RBI on May 17, 2004Date: May 17, 2004Availability of Rupee and Forex LiquidityThe Reserve Bank of India is closely monitoring the developments in the stock marketsand the other financial markets and stands ready to provide sufficient liquidity to thebanks for meeting all their payment obligations including for any intra-day requirements.A Task Force has been constituted under the Executive Director, Financial MarketCommittee (Smt. S. Gopinath) and it can be contacted for any clarification/ assistance at22614228 and Fax No.22657604.In the light of current developments in the foreign exchange markets, as at someprevious occasion, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to take the following actions:The Reserve Bank will continue to sell dollars through agent banks in order to augmentsupply in market or intervene directly to meet any demand supply imbalances. All thetransactions by RBI will be at the prevailing market rates as per the market practice. FIIswill no doubt continue to take their decision in regard to reducing or increasing theirstake in Indian equity markets. While RBI welcomes these flows it will also like to ensurethat those FIIs who wish to reduce the investment can do so as easily as possible atprevailing market rates. As in the past, the authorized dealers acting on behalf of theseFIIs are free to approach the RBI to procure foreign exchange at prevailing market ratesdepending on market conditions. RBI would either sell the foreign exchange directly oradvice the concerned bank to buy it in the market.For any further assistance the Task Force mentioned at para 2 may be contacted at anytime.Alpana KillawalaChief General ManagerPress Release: 2003-2004/1337Date: May 17, 2004Availability of Liquidity for Settlement BanksIn light of the developments in the Stock exchanges, the RBI has been in touch withmajor settlement banks and both the major stock exchanges to ensure that the paymentobligations on the exchanges are met smoothly.
