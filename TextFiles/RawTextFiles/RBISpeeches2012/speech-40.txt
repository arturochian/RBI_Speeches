Per cent India Growth Story 
What drove India’s growth in 
the pre-crisis period? 
4 4  India Growth Story 
Started fraying, beginning 
with the global financial 
crisis of 2008/09 
5 5   From One Crisis to Another 
 
• Just as we were recovering from 
2008/09 crisis, the eurozone crisis 
hit us. 
 
• Policy space to respond to the crisis 
is much less now than in 2008/09.  
6 6   India 
Current Macroeconomic Situation 
 
• Growth has moderated 
• Inflation is high and persistent 
• Balance of Payments under stress 
• Twin deficits (fiscal deficit, current account 
deficit) 
• Investment has decelerated 
• No policy space for stimulus 
7 7   Three Policy Dilemmas 
 
1. How do we manage the growth-
inflation dynamics? 
2. External Sector - how do we manage 
the short-term trade-offs without 
compromising long-term 
sustainability? 
3. Fiscal Consolidation - how to manage 
the political economy constraints? 
8 8   Dilemma - 1 
 
How do we manage the 
growth-inflation dynamics? 
9 9  Why has growth slowed?

Jul-12 What is driving Inflation? 
• Food (cyclical + structural) 
• Global commodity prices + 
depreciation 
• Fiscal deficit 
• Demand pressures 
12 12  Inflation and RBI 
• What has RBI done to control 
inflation? 
• Has RBI succeeded in controlling 
inflation? 
13 13 13   Growth - Inflation Risks 
• Global Uncertainty 
• Commodity Prices 
• Fiscal Deficit 
• Monsoon Performance 
• Supply Response

growth-inflation dynamics? 
15 15   Dilemma - 2 
 
External Sector - how do we 
manage the short-term trade-
offs without compromising 
long term sustainability? 
16 16  What is the external  
sector problem? 
• Large current account deficit (CAD) 
• Financing the CAD with stable flows

Current Account Deficit Net Capital Flows

As a percentage of GDP External Sector Problem 
• Why has current account deficit 
(CAD) increased? 
• Why have capital flows thinned? 
• What has been the result of this? 
19 19  How much has the rupee  
depreciated and why?

REER  
Rupee Depreciation? 
 
What is the impact of rupee 
depreciation? 
21 21  What has RBI done to 
contain volatility in the 
exchange rate? 
22 22  What is the ‘Capital Flows’ problem? 
• We want capital flows just equal to 
CAD 
• But they are invariably either too 
much or too little  
• And they are volatile 
 
23 23 23 23    Capital Flows - How volatile? 
Quickly Reversing Trends 
Pre-Crisis (2005/08)  -  Great Moderation - Volatile Inflows 
Crisis (2008/09) -  Safe Haven - Outflows - Sudden exit 
Post-Crisis (2010/11) -  Volatile inflows - ‘Currency Wars’ 
Eurozone Crisis (2011) -  Confidence Effect - Outflows 
24 24 24   Managing Capital Flows 
Change in world view on 
capital controls from pre-
crisis to post-crisis 
25 25 25   Managing Capital Flows 
• Two options 
- Capital Controls 
- Exchange Rate Management 
• No option is totally benign 
26 26 26 26    Managing Capital Flows 
No Benign Options 
Capital inflows 
Do not intervene           Currency appreciation 
Intervene but                 Inflationary pressure 
but do not sterilize 
Intervene and     Upward pressure on 
sterilize             interest rates

 External Sector Management 
What is RBI’s policy 
 -  on capital account? 
 - on exchange rate? 
28 28  External Sector Management 
Sustainable Solution 
• Reducing CAD in the medium term 
• Financing CAD in the short-term
