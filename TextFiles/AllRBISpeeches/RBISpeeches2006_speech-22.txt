1Credit Counselling : An Indian PerspectiveMr. Chairman, distinguished guests and friends,I am thankful to Mr. Balachandran for providing this opportunity to be with thiseminent gathering assembled for a noble cause. Bank of India has been among thebanks known to be a pioneer in several areas of commercial banking. In this context,the initiative by the bank to establish credit counselling centers on a pilot basishighlights the pro-active role being played by our banks. In fact, a major reason formy agreeing to participate in this ceremony is to demonstrate the Reserve Bank ofIndia's commitment to the cause of credit counselling - a recent initiative in ourcountry.In my remarks on this occasion, some introduction on the importance of this topicwould be in order. An overview of the global practice in this area could then befollowed by a discussion of the Indian context with regard to credit counselling. Anymechanism of credit counselling has to reckon with the processes, costs andbenefits. The concluding thoughts are in the nature of illustrative issues towardsinitiating and popularising credit counselling in India.IntroductionWith the changing growth dynamics of the economy, it is not difficult to envisagesituations where certain segments of the population become susceptible to excessiveborrower optimism or even to vicissitudes in the economic environment. Suchsusceptibility could also arise from unforeseen shocks or emergencies that makerepayment difficult. By providing sound advice to arrest the deterioration of incomesand restructure their debt, credit counselling offers a meaningful solution forborrowers to gradually overcome their debt burden and improve their moneymanagement skills. In this regard, the question is whether there is a role for publicpolicy in matters relating to credit counselling?We must recognise that financial intermediaries, the corporates and high net worthindividuals generally possess in-house knowledge of matters relating to financialmanagement and can afford to employ outside expertise as appropriate in regard totheir investment decision and management of distressed loans.  Public Policy hasenabled an operational mechanism in the form of Corporate Debt Restructuring(CDR) in regard to loans by banks and development financial institutions to largecorporates.  Somewhat similar framework has also been provided to small andmedium enterprise. In regard to agricultural loans and most of the small borrowers,                                                          1 Address Delivered by Dr. Y V Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Foundation DayFunction of the Bank of India, Mumbai on September 7, 2006.1however, only broad guidelines are issued to banks from time to time on parametersfor restructuring. The extent of active interaction between individual borrowers andbanks is, therefore, not clear. It is increasingly felt that individuals are not in a position to take full advantage of theguidelines issued to the banks for variety of reasons. These may includeinadequacies in managing their finances especially delinquent accounts. Further,individuals may not be able to articulate their financial situation adequately to thebanks. It will be in the interest of the banks themselves to help individual borrowersthrough appropriate credit counselling. Public policy could, therefore, have anadvisory role in encouraging mechanisms in the form of credit counselling in regard toindividuals.  There are a variety of ways in which this has been accomplished indifferent countries, but in India we are just beginning to address the situation. Someurgency has been lent to this issue in India in view of rapid growth in consumer loans,housing loans and the more recent emphasis on financial inclusion. It is interesting tonote that the terms of reference of the Financial Inclusion Task Force initiated by theTreasury of the United Kingdom to consider solutions to the problem of financialexclusion identifies three key areas. This includes face-to-face money advice inaddition to access to banking and access to affordable credit.Global practiceThe first well-known credit counselling agencies were created in 1951 in the UnitedStates when credit grantors created the National Foundation for Credit Counseling(NFCC). Their stated objective was to promote financial literacy and help consumersto avoid bankruptcy. Credit counselling, however, came into its own as a result of thepassing of the Housing and Urban Development Act in 1968. Under this Act, the USDepartment of Housing and Urban Development was allowed to authorize public andprivate organizations to provide counselling to mortgagors. The resulting services andinfrastructure to provide them led to the development of the credit counsellingindustry.In 1993, the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies(AICCCA) was founded in the United States, citing a need for industry-wide standardsof excellence and ethical conduct. This formally organized the NFCC’s competition.The AICCCA was formed from the group of counselors who favored telephonedelivery of debt management programs. The NFCC was, in the beginning, stronglyopposed to this telephone business model, primarily favoring face-to-face counsellingas a more effective solution. Eventually, all organizations practiced both phone andface-to-face processes with some agencies using large inbound call centers driven bymass media advertising.2The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 made creditcounselling a requirement for consumer debtors filing for bankruptcy in the UnitedStates. In order to meet this requirement, during the 180-day period preceding thefiling of bankruptcy, the debtor must complete a program with an approved non-profitbudget and credit counselling agency. Such a program may include, but is not limitedto, one counselling session conducted by phone or over the internet.Quickly, the concept caught the attention of other countries and over the last severalyears, a whole host of countries have undertaken significant initiatives towards creditcounselling. The Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS) in the UK, establishedin 1993, helps consumers with budgeting and better money management as alsotheir debt repayment plans. Funding for CCCS comes from the businesses in thecommunity which benefit from repayment they would not receive if the debtordefaulted. In addition, there is also a National Debt Line through which a bankcustomer can get free financial advice. In fact, the Banking Code in the U.K. providesthat member banks shall discuss financial problems with customers and togetherevolve a plan for resolving these problems.Canada established a non-profit counselling organization in 2000. Termed CreditCounseling Canada (CCC), the organization seeks to enhance the quality andavailability of not-for-profit credit counselling for all its citizens. The Bank NegaraMalaysia has established a Credit Counseling and Debt Management (CCDM)agency to provide credit counselling and loan restructuring advice to individuals. Thearrangement is expected to be a prompt and cost-effective means of debt settlementbased on the repayment plan between creditors and the debtor without intervention ofcourts. With rising personal bankruptcies, primarily on unsecured debt, CreditCounseling of Singapore (CCS), established in 2003, is meant to assist financiallydistressed consumers.Indian contextIn India, there has been a sharp growth in credit to household in recent years.According to the all-India Debt and Investment Survey 2003, nearly a fourth of thehouseholds were indebted in 2002. The per cent of indebtedness households in ruralareas increased sharply from 23 in 1991 to 27 in 2003; the corresponding figures forurban areas during the same period were 19 and 18, respectively. At end-March2004, the total number of loan accounts under direct finance to farmers was nearly 20million, comprising over 95 per cent of total number of loan accounts under thepriority sector; the amount involved was well over 70 per cent of total priority sectorloans.Even taking into account the changes in classification and coverage, bank credit tohousing and consumer durables witnessed an exponential growth rate of over 50 per3cent during 2001-2006, nearly double the growth recorded in overall non-food creditover the same period. As a consequence, the share of housing and consumerdurables in overall non-food credit by scheduled commercial banks increased fromaround 5 per cent in 2001 to nearly 14 per cent in 2006.Rapid economic growth coupled with demographic dynamics has led to a significantchange in consumers’ perceptions in our country. With a burgeoning middle-classand changing lifestyle aspirations, more and more people are resorting to debt tofinance their consumption and asset creation. At some stage in some cases, thiscould potentially lead to excesses, precipitating defaults. Such defaults could also bethe fallout of circumstances beyond one’s control. Costly medical emergencies,retrenchment from job, hardening of interest rates could inadvertently raise debtburdens in some cases not easily manageable within a given income stream. This ispartly reflected in the growing number of customer complaints against banks in therecent past. Over the period January 2003 to June 2005, the number of complaintsrelating to loans, credit cards and harassment in recovery aggregated nearly 34 percent of total number of complaints, which reinforces the need for credit counselling ina dynamic economic environment.The proportion of people dependent on agriculture still remains high in our country.With a predominantly rain-fed agriculture, monsoonal vagaries coupled with lack ofadequate risk mitigation policies could sometimes lead to hardship for the rain-dependent segment of the population. This needs to be considered in conjunctionwith the fact that the levels of literacy in our country are still relatively modest at 65.4per cent in 2001, with wide differentials between urban and rural areas. For instance,in 2001, the proportion of rural literate was about 59 per cent as compared with 80.3per cent in the urban areas. Additionally, the organised sector employment presentlycomprises less than 10 per cent of the workforce, leaving the vast majority of theworking population with irregular income streams and paucity of defined safety net,making them susceptible to unforeseen contingencies. This assumes even greaterrelevance in situations where the penetration of formal finance is less than adequate,presumably compelling people to take recourse to costly informal finance, often inconjunction with loans from banks.While the ‘arithmetics’ of extending credit are often diligently followed by lenders, inthe absence of consistent credit histories, banks are often at a loss in case of non-repayment by borrowers. Given the growing indebtedness, there is an increasingneed to develop follow-up services to enable distressed borrowers overcome creditdelinquencies. Credit counsellor thus offers a viable task-specific, advisory ad hocintermediary between the borrower and the bank concerned.4Counselling on the above lines generally serve three purposes. First, it examinesways to solve current financial problems. Second, by creating awareness about thecosts of misusing a credit, it improves financial management and develops realisticspending plans. Third, it advises the distressed people to gain access to thestructured financial system, including banking. However, such counselling will beappropriate only if it addresses unique situations of households in different parts ofIndia.Processes, costs and benefitsIt is technically possible for credit counselling to be ex ante or ex post. Ex antecounselling helps borrowers to decide upon the quantum of loans they can avail,based on their income profile and stream of cash flows. More importantly, ex antecounselling attempts to influence the stability of the borrowers’ flow of income andexpenses, thereby lowering the probability of default.  Ex post counselling typicallyoccurs after a crisis event, when the borrower has already missed one or severalpayments. The purpose of such counselling is to prevent default and foreclosure.  Itis, therefore, curative in nature.Credit counselling in practice generally tends to be ex post in nature. Suchcounselling involves one-on-one meetings, allowing the counsellor to observe thelevel of maintenance of the debt and other issues relevant to the stability of theborrower's situation. It includes advice on not only crisis management, and budgetingbut also exploring avenues and networks that can provide succour in the interim.Owing to these reasons, such counselling can be expensive, owing to the not-so-insignificant administrative costs involved.A credit counselling agency often receives most of its compensation from thecreditors to whom the debt payments are distributed. This funding relationship couldlead to the impression that credit counselling agencies are merely collections wings ofthe creditors. It is therefore essential to guard against these undesirable possibilities.In many instances, nurturing a borrower back to health after a default can be a time-consuming process, besides causing severe inconvenience for the distressedfamilies. Traditional banking technologies rely mainly on a set of pre-assignedstandards to determine whether a potential borrower will be able to service a loan.This lack of knowledge on low-income household circumstances restricts the banksability to objectively assess whether the expected loan can be sustainable.Sometimes, a two-track approach towards mitigation of borrower risks is advocated.In the near-term, credit counselling can constitute an integral part of banks’ loanapplication, which can facilitate better assessment of credit risk and repaymentcapacity. In the urban areas, where people are more techno-savvy, such counselling5can take place over the internet or the phone. In the rural areas, such interface couldbe made more personalised through direct face-to-face interaction with the affectedclientele. Such preventative counselling would enable the borrower to determine theoptimal level of sustainable debt and pre-empt deterioration of accounts at a futuredate. This is also likely to lower the incidence of customer complaints against banks.An important consequence of the counselling process may be that, as potentialborrowers learn more about the way financial markets function, they may learn tobehave more strategically and to prepay more often when interest rates are benign. Ifsuch behavior becomes prevalent, together with a positive effect of counselling ondefault, it may be an additional argument that counselling helps low-incomeborrowers.IssuesIt is necessary to recognise that there are several issues which require to beaddressed in identifying possible approaches to initiate and popularise creditcounselling for individual borrowers. Let me flag some of these issues for yourconsideration.First, how well can we combine credit counselling with some elements of financialliteracy? Second, should credit counselling concentrate on ex ante or only on ex post elementsor some combination of both?Third, should credit counselling agencies devise differential mechanisms to take intoaccount different credit segments such as housing loans, consumer loans, farm loansas well as different categories of individual borrowers such as salaried, self-employed, seasonally employed etc? Is it better to have more general creditcounsellors?Fourth, given the differential nature of cash flows and consumption patterns in ruraland urban areas, is there a need for a segmented approach towards creditcounselling?Fifth, should there be accreditation of credit counsellors? If so, who should do it -industry association or individual banks? Should counselling be a full-time or part-time work for the credit counsellors?Sixth, what should be the elements of confidentiality that are assured in this processto gain the confidence of distressed borrowers in need of counselling?6Seventh, how do we select the credit counsellors, equip them to do the work andmake them accountable?  What type of training - both in terms of knowledge andattitude - could be imparted to make credit counsellors effective? Can the trainingcolleges of banks be of help in this respect?Eighth, should there be a role for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) andconsumer organisations in order to expand the outreach of counselling practices?Finally, should the findings emanating from the discussion of credit counsellorsconstitute part of the agenda for the District-Level Bankers' Committees?I have only touched upon some of the issue germane to the initiation of the process atthe present juncture. What is, however, important is to recognise that instead of a'one-size-fits-all', banks should be free to experiment and evolve their ownmechanisms and adopt approaches best suited to their business philosophy. Sincefinancial counselling pertains primarily to individual borrowers at the local level, adecentralised approach could prove useful. Being a relatively new area whosepotential is still to be proved, it is imperative to proceed in measured steps andreassess the situation based on the experience gained. In progressing towards thislaudable objective, we, however, should not create another cadre of employees orpotentially avoidable intermediaries between banks and their borrowers. We, in Reserve Bank are happy to note the initiative taken by Bank of India in startingcredit counselling centres on a pilot basis. The involvement of trust 'Abhay' lendsvalue and credibility to this pilot project. It is also noteworthy that one each in urbanand rural areas is being initiated. We are looking forward to learn from the experienceof this laudable initiative. I commend other banks to attempt some pilot projects, asconsidered appropriate by them, to explore the potential for beneficial use of creditcounselling.Thanking you.7
