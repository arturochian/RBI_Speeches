  Global Capital Flows and the Indian Economy:   ? Opportunities and Challenges   I thank the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Shri Suyash Baderiya for this  opportunity to interact with such a talented gathering of young minds. As you know, capital  flows have played a major role in the process of globalization. While these flows bring  several benefits, they pose certain risks. How in India we have handled this issue to enhance  the sustainability of our external sector, is the topic of my deliberation today.  Capital flows pose a puzzle both in theory and practice.  On the one hand, they are  credited with a key role in the development of the modern day economies by alleviating  resource constraints and facilitating technology transfer.   On the other hand, they are also  blamed for several external debt and financial crises. Understanding the various facets of  capital flows has been intellectually challenging as the reality runs counter to theory.  For  example, the neo-classical economic theory suggests that capital should flow from advanced  countries that have relatively high capital-to-labor ratios (capital abundant countries) to  developing countries that have relatively low capital-to-labor ratios (labor abundant  countries).  Paradoxically, capital often flows uphill from developing to advanced countries  as was seen in the recent years.    History of Private Capital Flows     th th In the pre-First World War period spanning the 19 century and the early 20 century,  London was the pre-eminent financial center, and many of todays developed countries were  developing then. This period saw a great expansion of private investment in developing  countries, notably in the United States (US), Canada and Australia. It also stretched to  Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and India. The capital flows to developing countries took two main  forms:  bond issues by various levels of public administration and foreign direct investment  (FDI).     In the interwar period, in the 1920s the US emerged as a major lender. Consequently,  New York emerged as a key center for international lending up until the Great Depression of  1929.  The interwar period was also marked by extensive defaults. Latin America was   ?

In the immediate post-Second World War  period there was virtually no borrowing by developing countries in the world capital market.    Private portfolio investment and bank lending resumed only in the 1960s.   By the 1980s,  private capital flows had picked up substantially.  This is the period when the Latin American  debt crisis erupted reflecting macroeconomic imbalances arising out of high budget deficits  and overvalued exchange rates. Later, the East Asian Economies were faced with a currency  crisis in 1997 even though they had good macroeconomic fundamentals. The infirmity  emanated primarily from huge short-term external borrowings by banks and corporates.   A common thread running through the debt crises is that in almost all the episodes,   waves of lendings were followed by  a  sudden  stop  or reversal of capital flows resulting  in   distress  in  the  borrowing  countries. What lessons did the Emerging and Developing  Economies (EDEs) learn from these crises?  Though gross capital flows to EDEs accelerated  in the 2000s, but for the interruption in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, their external  balance sheets showed greater resilience. This is reflected in changes in the components of  1 international investment positions (IIPs) of major EDEs .  The external liabilities of EDEs  once were mainly debt.  Now FDI and portfolio equity together dominate the stock of their  liabilities (Table 1). The advantage of FDI and portfolio equity flows over pure debt flows is  that there is risk sharing between the lender and borrower in the case of the former.  Moreover, FDI flows tend to be more stable than other forms of capital flows.   Another strength has been the increase in foreign exchange reserves in the overall  external assets of EDEs. This has provided a counterweight to risk taking by the private  sector. Of course, it is another debate as to how much of reserve is adequate and at what level  benefits outweigh costs. But there is no disagreement that reserves provide inherent strength  and stability to an economy, particularly EDEs.    1  The international investment position (IIP) is a countrys balance sheet in relation to the rest of the world, one  side of which is its total foreign assets including official reserves and the other is its external liabilities.  2   Table 1: Key Components of External Liabilities and Assets    As a Share of External  As a Share of External Liabilities Assets  Per cent  FDI Portfolio Equity FDI plus Portfolio Equity Forex Reserves  2000 2007 2010 2000 2007 2010 2000 2007 2010 2000 2007 2010  Advanced Economies  20.0 18.4 19.7 15.0 13.8 9.9 40.3 38.6 31.4 5.8 1.9 1.2  Average (Median)  Emerging Markets  31.8 39.4 40.5 3.7 8.2 34.4 56.7 56.2 34.6 43.7 38.8  Average (Median) 8.4  Selected Advanced Economies  17.7 17.0 15.5 20.2 15.8 12.4 38.0 32.7 27.9 2.1 0.7 0.7  Euro Area average  10.2 7.6 7.2 22.2 10.4 9.9 32.5 18.0 17.1 0.8 0.3 0.3  United Kingdom  18.8 11.9 11.7 21.7 16.0 13.1 40.4 27.9 24.8 0.5 0.2 0.3  United States  Selected Emerging Markets  32.8 33.6 36.5 9.9 39.6 33.3 42.7 73.2 69.8 33.2 48.5 47.1  Brazil  59.4 57.3 63.2 5.7 5.6 8.8 61.4 66.3 65.6 37.6 63.3 69.0  China  14.7 25.8 32.5 12.6 24.8 18.5 27.2 50.5 51.1 59.8 79.4 67.9  India  17.5 39.5 38.6 6.0 24.9 17.5 23.5 64.4 56.1 9.8 42.7 36.6  Russia  43.5 39.0 41.5 22.6 38.9 35.0 66.1 77.9 76.5 6.2 13.6 13.4  South Africa  Table adopted from Prasad, Eswar. 2011. Role Reversal in Global Finance. IZA Discussion Paper No.6032    Capital Flows to EDEs    Gross capital inflows to EDEs rose over eight fold from US $ 200 billion in 1999 to  over US $ 1,700 billion in 2007, just before the crisis in 2008. While FDI increasing steadily  remained the most stable component, the acceleration was dictated by portfolio and other  investment. During the crisis the gross portfolio investment inflows to these economies  dropped sharply from about US $ 420 billion in 2007 to a low of about US $ 10 billion in  2008 (Chart 1).   3   The long term trend in capital flows indicates that the peaks in capital flows are often  followed by sudden fall. In the 2000s, net capital flows to EDEs peaked to 4 per cent of their  GDP just before the global financial crisis in 2008 (Chart 2).      Determinants of Capital Flows  The  factors  explaining international  capital flows  are categorized into push  factors  that  are  external  to  an economy, and pull factors that are internal  to an economy.   The push factors include parameters such as low interest rates in advanced economies,  abundant liquidity, slow growth and the lack of domestic investment opportunities as also  deregulation that has allowed greater global risk diversification in industrial countries. The  pull factors include parameters such as the robust economic performance and the improved  investment climate in EDEs, which are the results of a series of trade, financial and legal  4 reforms.  However, which factor would be dominant in a particular phase of the cycle is  difficult to fathom.  Benefits and Risks of Capital Flows    In theory, free flow of capital across borders should lead to a more efficient allocation  of resources between savers and investors across the world. Further, as the capital flows to  capital scarce developing countries it brings along technical know-how and thus should  increase growth in the recipient countries and help them to reduce the volatility in their  consumption and investment in response to exogenous shocks. However, this position is not  2 widely shared .   While there is a broad agreement among economists on the desirability of open trade  in goods, there is much disagreement with respect to the virtues of financial openness. Even  strong proponents of free trade such as Jagdish Bhagwati have expressed skepticism about  3 the gains from unfettered trade in financial assets.   Prasad, Rajan and Subramanian (2007)  find that among non-industrial countries, lesser reliance on foreign capital is associated with  higher growth.  Capital Controls  The sudden reversal that the EDEs had to face during the crisis of 2008 despite their  good fundamentals and improved external liabilities position brought to the fore various  questions on capital controls again.  Capital flows have interfered with the simultaneous  management of fixed/managed exchange rate peg and inflation targets  a phenomenon  known as Mundells Impossible Trinity. For EDEs with flexible exchange rates, volatility  of the exchange rate and the loss of trade competitiveness prompts central banks to  occasionally intervene in the foreign exchange market. This increases domestic liquidity with  its inflationary consequences if left unsterilized. But sterilization has quasi-fiscal costs.    2  Cardoso, E.A., and R.

Foreign Capital and  Economic Growth, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.     5 Against this backdrop, the issue of capital controls, especially the imposition of  financial transactions tax, some form of Tobin Tax, is being widely debated among policy  makers in multilateral forums like the G-20, and the IMF as well as in academic circles.   Significantly, the Bretton Woods institutions have relaxed their earlier position on  capital controls. The IMF's own Independent Evaluation Office found that during the 1990s  the Fund clearly encouraged capital account liberalization in its bilateral policy advice to  member countries. The Funds multilateral surveillance also emphasized the benefits to  developing countries of greater access to international capital flows.  But following the 2008  crisis, in a policy note in February 2010 the IMF noted circumstances in which capital  controls can be a legitimate component of the policy response to surges in capital flows. The  World Bank also recognized that capital controls might need to be imposed as a last resort to  help mitigate a financial crisis and stabilize macroeconomic developments. The G-20  recognised in October 2011 that to maintain financial stability, capital controls may be  adopted or reversed as destabilizing pressures abate.  Against this background, I now turn to evolution of our policy and experience with  capital flows.   Capital Account Management in India  Indias capital account liberalization began in a substantive sense in 1991 following a  severe balance of payments (BoP) crisis. The analytical foundations for reforms were  provided by three reports: Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments  (Chairman: C. Rangarajan, 1991) and the two reports on Capital Account Convertibility  (Chairman: S.S.Tarapore, 1997 and 2006). These reports, inter alia, suggested: (i)  encouragement to private capital inflows; (ii) shift from debt creating to non-debt creating  flows, (iii) a shift within the debt inflows from short-term to long-term debt, (iv) emphasized  on monitoring of external commercial borrowings, and (v) gradual liberalisation of outflows.   The capital account liberalization in India was considered as a process rather than an  event. The sequencing of the process was conditional on underlying domestic  macroeconomic fundamentals and sustainability of the BoP. Considerable progress has since  been made as reflected in the volume and variety of capital flows without undermining the  stability of our external account.    6 Indias status with regard to capital account liberalisation could be seen in terms of its  policy stance towards capital transactions by residents and non-residents on the one hand and  by the underlying instruments of cross border flows on the other. Non-residents have been  provided considerable extent of convertibility whereas permission to residents to undertake  capital account transactions across borders is relatively restrained. Moreover, distinction is  made not only between residents and non-residents but also between different categories of  residents.  Residents  If residents are classified into corporates, financial institutions and individuals, the  regime is most liberal in the case of corporates followed by financial intermediaries and  individuals. Corporates and financial intermediaries are permitted to raise equity resources  through American Depository Receipts (ADRs)/ Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and are  allowed to borrow through debt instruments from abroad. External Commercial Borrowings  (ECBs) could be raised under both automatic and approval routes subject to quantity as well  as price restrictions. Under automatic route, eligible borrowers in industry, infrastructure  sector and NBFCs (excluding micro finance companies) can now borrow upto US $ 750  million in a year. For borrowing above this stipulation prior approval is required. There is an  all-in-cost ceiling currently ranging between 350 basis points and 500 basis points over 6  month LIBOR for loans with minimum maturity of 3 years to more than 5 years. Banks can  borrow upto 50 per cent of their unimpaired Tier I capital. Apart from inflows, corporates are  allowed to invest abroad in overseas joint or wholly owned subsidiaries up to 400 per cent of  their net worth. Banks can invest overseas up to 25 per cent out of their demand and time  liabilities in India. Indian mutual funds can invest abroad within overall aggregate limit of US  $ 7 billion. Individuals can remit an amount equivalent to US dollar 200,000 in a year under  liberalized remittance scheme.   Non-residents  Non-resident corporates and financial intermediaries can invest in domestic  companies and instruments across sectors subject to some instrument-wise and sector-wise  conditions. For portfolio investment, they need to register themselves with the SEBI.  Recently, Qualified Foreign Investors (QFI) including individuals and groups or associations  have also been permitted to invest directly in the equity market in India after meeting the  stipulated norms including Know Your Customer (KYC).  7 Instruments  In terms of instruments, inflows to India are subject to a hierarchy of preferences with  direct investment preferred over portfolio flows, rupee denominated debt preferred over  foreign currency debt and medium and long-term debt preferred over short-term debt.    As regards, non-debt flows, the overall approach has been to substantially liberalise  FDI flows so as to meet domestic investment requirements and raise growth potential of the  economy. However, keeping in view socio-economic implications, FDI is prohibited in  certain sectors, viz., lottery business, chit funds, nidhi companies, tobacco products,  agriculture and plantation, and activities/sectors not open to private sector investment, e.g.,  atomic energy and railway transport other than mass rapid transport systems. Though FDI in  multi-brand retail is not allowed, the Government is actively debating this issue.   Apart from direct investment, non-residents can acquire equity stakes through  portfolio investment as well. Portfolio investment could be made by the entities which are  registered with the SEBI as Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). FIIs do not need prior  approval as long as they are within the sectoral and individual limits. There are no restrictions  on repatriation of equity investments.  With regard to debt flows, policy levers comprise both quantity and price based  prudential prescriptions. There is a ceiling on the extent of FII investment in sovereign debt  (US $ 15 billion) and corporate debt (US $ 45 billion) and there is also a withholding tax.  ECBs flows under both the automatic and approval routes are moderated by interest rate  ceilings and those under the automatic route through an additional quantity ceiling.  In  addition, there are end use and minimum maturity restrictions of 3 years for ECB. However,  trade credit is available for short-term with quantity and price restrictions.   Foreign Currency denominated Non-Resident Indian (NRI) deposits are regulated  through an interest rate ceiling linked to LIBOR/SWAP rate of the corresponding currency.  However, rupee denominated NRI deposits have recently been deregulated with the condition  that interest rate on those should not be more than the rate offered on domestic deposits of  comparable maturities. There is no restriction on repatriation of NRI deposits.   In sum, a gradual and calibrated liberalisation has progressively opened up Indias  capital account with a preference for equity investment over debt. Now I turn to a review of  trends in capital flows to India since the last BoP crisis of 1991.  8 Trends in Capital Flows to India  In the period leading up to the crisis, the capital account was dominated by debt  creating flows. For example, in 1990-91, debt creating flows constituted about 97 per cent of  capital inflows. In the debt creating flows, there was a large component of external  assistance. However, this scenario changed substantially following the BoP crisis that  triggered wide ranging reforms.   The period since 1991-92 can be seen in three phases on the basis of our economic  performance based on economic growth: Phase I (1992-93 to 2002-03) when Indias  economic growth recovered from a low of 1.4 per cent in 1991-92 to an annual average of 5.8  per cent; Phase II (2003-04 to 2007-08) when India registered its highest average annual  growth rate of 8.7 per cent; and Phase III (2008-09 to 2010-11), the most recent period  following the global financial crisis which dented both Indias economic growth and volume  of capital inflows (Table 2).  How did capital flows behave during these phases? This is an  issue I turn to next.

There was a significant shift in favour of equity which accounted  for over 54 per cent of capital inflows. Within equity, the FDI component was dominant. In  9 the debt component, NRI deposits were dominant. During the 5-year period 2003-08, there  was a sharp increase in capital inflows to an annual average of US $ 45 billion. The  composition of inflows continued to be towards equity, though its share moderated slightly to  53 per cent. However, within equity there was a shift towards portfolio investment. The debt  flows were dominated by trade credit and external commercial borrowings.   During the recent 3-year period of 2008-11, net capital inflows moderated to an  annual average of US $ 39 billion. The composition of capital inflows continued to be  towards equity inflows with equal share between FDI and portfolio investment. The debt  component was dominated by external commercial borrowings (Tables 3).   Table 3: Relative Share of Debt and Equity in Capital Flows  (in per cent)  Crisis Year Period Average  1992-93 to 2003-04 to 2008-09 to     1990-91 1991-92  2002-03 2007-08 2010-11  1.

Indias outward FDI peaked from US $ 2.2 billion in 2004-05 to US $ 19.4 billion in 2008-09  before moderating somewhat to US $ 16.5 billion in 2010-11 (Chart 3). This underscores  maturing of Indias capital account liberalization process which has encouraged two-way  flows. How did this rising trend and shift in composition of capital flows impact the BoP?  This is an issue, I turn to next.     10    An inward looking Indian economy with a restrictive capital account regime, which  was biased against equity inflows, was highly vulnerable to external shock. Hence, a  widening of current account deficit (CAD) to 3.0 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 in the wake of  the Gulf war and crude oil price spike was not clearly sustainable (Table 4). Prior to 1990-91  also India had periodically faced significant external financing constraints and went knocking  at the doors of the IMF from time to time. Following the wide ranging reforms initiated in the  1990s, which encompassed both trade and financial liberalization, the resilience of the Indias  external sector improved vastly.  11   Table 4: Key Components of BoP as a percentage of GDP  (in per cent)  Crisis Year Period Average  1992-93 to 2003-04 to 2008-09 to    1990-91 1991-92  2002-03 2007-08 2010-11  1.

Given a capital account balance of 2.2 per cent of GDP, there was accumulation  of foreign exchange reserve of 1.6 per cent of GDP per annum. In the following period, 2003- 08, CAD improved to an average of 0.5 per cent. With a strong capital inflow of 5.1 per cent  of GDP per annum, the pace of reserve accumulation rose to 4.6 per cent of GDP per annum.  On the terminal year of this period, Indias foreign exchange reserves as a percentage of GDP  peaked at 25 per cent at end-March 2008. (Chart 4)  In the recent period of 2008-11, CAD  expanded significantly averaging 2.6 per cent of GDP per annum (Table 4 & Chart 5). As  capital inflows moderated simultaneously to 2.7 per cent of GDP per annum, there was only  small accretion to reserves at the rate of 0.1 per cent of GDP per annum. Latest information  suggests that CAD expanded to 3.6 per cent of GDP in the first half of 2011-12. As capital  inflows fell short of CAD under current global financial stress, there was a drawdown of  reserves.     12          The foregoing discussion suggests that India has persistently registered current  account deficit, since 1990-91 barring the three years, 2001-04. Though the average CAD  was moderate for a long period, this has expanded since 2008-09. What does this imply? The  persistent current account deficit accumulates into increasing claim of non-residents on India.  This is captured in Indias international investment position (IIP) which delineates its external  balance sheet. Indias international liabilities have remained higher than international assets  and the difference between the two has increased significantly from US $ (-) 51 billion at  end-March 2008 to US $ (-) 238 billion at end-June 2011 but improved slightly to $ (-) 225  billion at end-September 2011 (Chart 6).  Our liabilities were mainly on account of portfolio  investment, FDI and external commercial loans.  The bulk of our international assets are in  13 the form of foreign exchange reserve assets of the RBI, followed by direct investment abroad  by the corporate sector.     While IIP gives the full balance sheet picture, how has our external-debt position  shaped, given our preference for non-debt creating flows? Notably, Indias external debt  stock remained steady during the 13-year period between 1991 and 2003 in the range of US $  84-105 billion. Since then, the debt stock has risen to US $ 306 billion by March 2011.  However, the ratio of Indias external debt to GDP has declined over the years from 28.7 per  cent in 1990-91 to 17.3 per cent in 2010-11. The debt service ratio declined from 35.3 per  4 cent to 4.2 per cent during the same period. As regards the composition of external debt,  there was a distinct decline in the share of government debt from 42.7 per cent of total  external debt in March 2001 to 24.2 per cent by March 2011 with corresponding increase in  private debt (Charts 7 & 8).   4  Debt service ratio, as measured by the proportion of total debt service payments to current receipts of balance  of payments (BoP), is an indicator of debt sustainability. 14       Although, Indias external debt service position has improved, recently in the wake of  moderation in inflows amidst destabilized euro area financial turmoil some of our external  vulnerability indicators have worsened. For example, reserves cover of total debt has fallen  below 100 per cent (Table 5).  15   Table 5: External Sector Vulnerability Indicators (Per cent)  Indicators End- End- End- March March Sep  2008 2011 2011 ? 1.

First, global capital flows now increasingly show a two-way movement between  EDEs and advanced economies. However, EDEs remain vulnerable to volatility and sudden  stops in capital flows.  This is because EDEs have limitation in borrowing in their own  currencies in international capital markets, a phenomenon known as original sin.  This is  evident from the recent crisis.  The epicenter of 2008 crisis was the US but capital flows to  EDEs, including India, was severely affected.  Now the epicenter has shifted to Europe but  capital flows to EDEs continues to be impaired.     Second, considerable lessons seem to have been learnt by EDEs from their past  experience debt and currency crises, particularly from the Latin American debt crisis of the  1980s and the East Asian currency crisis of 1997. This has reinforced the hierarchy of capital  flows with a preference by EDEs for equity flows. This is also reflected in a discernible shift  in the composition of capital flows to EDEs in favour of equity, particularly FDI.   Third, capital flows to EDEs depend on push factors emanating from low interest rate  and lack of investment opportunity in advanced economies as well as by pull factors  16 emanating from strong economic fundaments and growth prospects in the recipient country.  Particularly, stable flows like FDI are guided more by pull factors.   Fourth, availability of foreign capital is not an unmixed blessing. While it alleviates  domestic resource constraints, it could also destabilize the economy in two ways: one, excess  capital inflows could result in asset price inflation and loss of competitiveness through over  valuation of exchange rate; two, sudden outflow on risk aversion could trigger a currency  crisis.   Fifth, the earlier dominant view was tilted towards unfettered capital movement. But,  following the recent global financial crisis of 2008, there is explicit recognition  even by  multilateral bodies such as the IMF, World Bank and the G20  that capital controls may be  desirable under certain circumstances.    Sixth, Indias external sector policy had always believed in some form of  management of our capital account with a preference for equity inflows, though there is now  international recognition of this policy. This policy of cautious opening of the capital account  has served us well as reflected in the stability of our BoP since the 1991 crisis. The  composition of our capital account has shifted from almost entirely debt to predominantly  equity.     Seventh, notwithstanding relative stability of our BoP, some stress has developed  post-2008 global financial crisis as capital inflows have moderated in the face of expanding  current account deficit. This is reflected in worsening of some of the vulnerability indicators  of the external sector. Our dependence on private capital inflows to finance our current  account deficit has increased. Moreover, we have to factor in uncertainties in the global  financial markets. These developments call for vigorous domestic policy reforms with a  greater emphasis on trade competitiveness and energy security so as to enhance the pull  factor for FDI to reinforce our BoP.   Finally, in conclusion what advice can I give to such bright minds as yours? Like  capital flows your talent knows no boundary. You are truly global citizens. While this  provides an opportunity, it is also a challenge for you to unleash your creative potential to  innovate for the global welfare.   Thank you.  *******  17
