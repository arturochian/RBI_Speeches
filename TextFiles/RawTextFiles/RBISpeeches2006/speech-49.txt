Reforms, Productivity and Efficiency in Banking:
The Indian Experience
*
Rakesh Mohan
Let me at the outset congratulate the Pakistan Society of Development
Economists for organising this Conference. Issues of productivity and efficiency have
been at the centre-stage of discussions in recent years. Nowhere is this truer than the
financial sector, which is perceived to be the ‘brain’ of the economy (Stiglitz, 1998). Even
within the financial sector, given the dominance of bank-based financial systems in most
emerging markets including ours and the systemic importance of banks in the financial
system, the banking sector continues to be the centre of attention for academia and
policymakers alike. Not surprisingly therefore, performance of the banking sector has
repercussions across the length and breadth of the economy. Judged thus, the theme of
the Conference immediately appealed to me in view of its topicality and timeliness. As a
central banker, the obvious topic for me to speak on relates to productivity and efficiency
in Indian banking.
The objective of reforms in general is to accelerate the growth momentum of the
economy, defined in terms of per capita income. Typically, improvements in the growth
rate can be effected through three, not necessarily mutually exclusive channels:
improving productivity of capital, through investments in human capital and raising total
factor productivity (TFP).
The quality of functioning of the financial sector can be expected to affect the
functioning and productivity of all sectors of the economy. Efficient financial
intermediation should help in improving economy-wide resource allocation thereby
promoting productivity growth all round.  Thus discussion on economic efficiency and
productivity should involve analysis of developments in the financial sector.
Improvements in the financing of physical and human capital, both in terms of increasing
magnitudes, and in terms of allocative efficiency, should raise efficiency and productivity
across the economy.  This approach justifies the choice of my topic today.
Financial intermediation is essential to the promotion of both extensive and
intensive growth.  The efficient intermediation of funds from savers to users enables the
application of available resources to their most productive uses. The more efficient a
financial system is in such resource generation and in its allocation, the greater is its
contribution to productivity and economic growth.  As resource allocation improves and
real returns increase, savings would presumably respond and higher resource
generation should result.  Thus, development of the financial system is essential to the
generation of higher productivity and economic growth.
 I will structure my address along the following lines. First, I will explore in brief
the impact of banking sector productivity on the rest of the economy. This is relevant in
view of the fact that any discussion on productivity and efficiency issues in banking
would need to be judged in conjunction with the level of financial development and other

country-specific features. This will be followed by a brief review of banking sector
reforms in India. The subsequent section will examine, in some detail, the trends in
productivity and efficiency in Indian banking. My concluding remarks will be in the nature
of the way ahead on areas germane to this sector at the present juncture.
2. How does productivity in banking influence the rest of the economy?
Economic history provides support for the fact that financial development makes
a fundamental contribution to growth. Financial development helped in the promotion of
industrialisation in developed countries by facilitating the mobilisation of capital for large
investments. Well-functioning banks or other financial intermediaries such as venture
capital funds also spur technological innovation by identifying and funding entrepreneurs
who are perceived to have the best chances of developing new products successfully
and for implementing innovative production processes.
Recent research has provided robust evidence supporting the view that financial
development contributes to economic growth.
• At the cross-country level, various measures of financial development (including
measures of financial sector assets, domestic credit to private sectors and stock
market capitalization) are found to be positively related to economic growth.
• Other studies establish a positive relationship between financial development
and growth at the industry level (Rajan and Zingales, 1998).
• Similarly, at the firm level, firms in countries with deeper financial development
are able to obtain more external funds and thereby enabled to grow faster
(Demirgúc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1998).
A basic indicator of financial development is the contribution of finance-related
activities to GDP. The share of real GDP originating from finance-related activities in
India tripled from just around 2 per cent during the 1970s to around 6 per cent during the
1990s and further to 7 per cent during the first half of this decade. Within the services
sector, the share of finance rose from less than 5 per cent to more than 12 per cent over
the same period (Table 1).

The broad-based indicators of financial development, as culled from the flow-of-
funds accounts, are also testimony to gradual widening and deepening of the economy.
Most of the commonly tracked ratios exhibited an upward trend during the 1970s and
1980s, while moderate fluctuations in these ratios were observed during the 1990s
(Table 2). What is of interest is that the Finance Ratio, a proxy for financial deepening,
witnessed remarkable improvement over this period.

When we move away from these broad-based indicators to more specific
liquidity- and credit-based indicators, a similar picture emerges. Illustratively, the ratio of
aggregate deposits to GDP exceeded 50 per cent during the first half of the current
decade; M3/GDP has averaged around 50 per cent since the 1990s. At a slightly more
disaggregated level, while bank credit to government has witnessed some tapering off in
the second half of the 1990s, credit to the commercial sector averaged over 30 per cent
of GDP during the first half of the current decade (Table 3). These observations are
particularly relevant from the standpoint of the role of banks in the intermediation
process. Juxtaposed with the financial sector reforms, this suggests that the enhanced
freedom of banks since the liberalisation process has provided them with the flexibility in
resource mobilisation and deployment, which has manifested itself in the uptrend in
these ratios. Thus financial deepening has been taking place continuously in India and is
still in progress.

 By issues we mean 'sources of funds' or 'financial liability' of the sectors.
Secondary issues refer to issues by financial intermediaries (i.e. banks and other financial
institutions).
Therefore, secondary issues = sources of funds of banking sector + sources of funds of other
financial sector.
Primary issues refer to issues by all sectors other than financial intermediaries.
Finance Ratio (FR) captures the relationship between financial development and overall
economic growth.
The relationship between financial development and the growth of physical investment is

The New Issue Ratio (NIR) reflects the proportion of primary claims issued by non-financial
institutions

Studies by the Reserve Bank (RBI, 2000) on the association between finance
and growth for an extended time span from 1971-72 to 1999-2000 find that the causality
between finance (proxied by real M3 growth) and growth (proxied by real GDP growth) is
bi-directional. However, in the absence of any structural model underlying such
relationships, these ‘causality’ estimates can only be interpreted in terms of the
predictive content of each of the variables. Subsequent research on the inter-linkage
between finance and growth in India has veered around to the view that the Indian
growth process has essentially been ‘finance-led’: expansion in the financial sector
played an enabling role in promoting capital accumulation, which, in turn, engendered
higher growth (Bell and Rousseau, 2001). Typically however, studies of this genre tend
to be susceptible to the time period and choice of variables, so that a different period
with another set of variables could possibly lead to different conclusions. What is,
however, accepted is that finance did play a role in influencing the growth process in
India, although such observations related to financial deepening have little to say about
efficiency and productivity growth.
The aforesaid observations do not take into account the changing dynamics of
the financial system. The traditional classification of the financial system as bank- or
market-based often tends to be static; in contrast, financial systems evolve and develop
over time in response to changes in the institutional environment, legal set up and other
country-specific features. This has been the case in India as well. Many of you would be
aware that, cross-country classifications of financial system have typically classified
India as a ‘bank-based’ system. This is not surprising, since banks have traditionally
been the dominant financial intermediaries. However, the relative share of banks in total
financial sector assets, which was nearly three-fourths in the early 1980s, came down
gradually over a period of time and has hovered around the two-thirds mark since the
1990s (Ray & Sengupta, 2004).
More importantly however, following the rapid growth of stock markets since the
1990s, the role of ‘market-based’ finance has been on the rise. The most commonly
employed measure of financial system orientation – the ratio of market capitalisation to
bank assets - supports this observation (Table 4). This suggests that not only have
financial institutions gained in terms of financial assets, but there is also considerable
potential for market financing to develop. However, the magnitude of market
capitalisation is obviously dependent on the vagaries of the stock market: it is not
expected to exhibit a consistent increase as a ratio of GDP, whereas the growth in bank
assets/GDP ratio is much more regular.5

Whereas financial deepening is easier to measure, analysing productivity and
efficiency changes in banking is more complex and needs to be viewed in relation to the
changing contours of the banking industry in India.

3. Contours of Indian Banking Sector Reforms
The transformation of the banking sector in India needs to be viewed in light of
the overall economic reforms process along with the rapid changes that have been
taking place in the global environment within which banks operate. The global forces of
change include technological innovation, the deregulation of financial services
internationally, our own increasing exposure to international competition and, equally
important, changes in corporate behaviour such as growing disintermediation and
increasing emphasis on shareholder value. Recent banking crises in Asia, Latin America
and elsewhere have accentuated these pressures.
As many of you would be aware, India embarked on a strategy of economic
reforms in the wake of a serious balance-of-payments crisis in 1991; a central plank of
the reforms was reform in the financial sector and, with banks being the mainstay of
financial intermediation, the banking sector. The objective of the banking sector reforms
was to promote a diversified, efficient and competitive financial system with the ultimate
objective of improving the allocative efficiency of resources through operational flexibility,
improved financial viability and institutional strengthening. A summary profile of the
banking industry over the last 15 years is presented in Table 5.

As you are aware, the financial system in India by the late 1980s was
characterized by dominant government ownership of banks and financial institutions,
widespread use of administered and variegated interest rates, and financial repression
through forced financing of government fiscal deficits by banks and through
monetisation.  Thus, although a great degree of financial deepening had indeed taken
place and financial savings had increased continuously, financial markets were not really
functioning, and there was little price discovery in terms of the cost of money, i.e.,
interest rates.  The efficiency and productivity enhancing function of the financial system
was severely handicapped.  Hence, a widespread financial sector reform effort has been
underway since 1991.

Let me briefly sum up the major areas of banking sector reforms :
• Financial repression through statutory pre-emptions has been reduced, while
stepping up prudential regulations at the same time.
• Interest rates have been progressively deregulated on both the deposit and
lending sides (Box I).
Restoration of the health of the banking system has involved:
• Restoration of public sector banks' net worth achieved through
recapitalisation where needed (total cost less than one per cent of GDP).
• Competition increased through entry of new private sector banks and foreign
banks.
• Higher levels and standards of disclosure achieved to enhance market
transparency.
• Bank regulation and supervision strengthened towards international best
practice.
• Micro prudential measures instituted.

  A detailed discussion on this aspect is contained in Bhide et al. (2001).7
• Supervision process streamlined with combination of on-site and off-site
surveillance along with external auditing.
• Risk based supervision introduced.
• Process of structured and discretionary intervention introduced for problem
banks through a prompt corrective action mechanism.
• Ownership of public sector banks has been broadened through disinvestment
up to 49 per cent, and banks have been listed (Table 6).
• Mechanism for greater regulatory coordination instituted for regulation and
supervision of financial conglomerates.
• Measures taken to strengthen creditor rights (still in process).

As the banking system has been liberalised and become increasingly market-
oriented and financial markets have developed concurrently, the conduct of monetary
policy has also been tailored to take into account the realities of the changing
environment (switch from direct to indirect instruments).
This macro approach to financial monitoring has enabled policy makers to fine-
tune their regulatory stance in consonance with the changing market and institutional
dynamics so as to balance growth and stability concerns. For instance, despite the
gradual tightening of prudential norms, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) to total
loans, which was at a high of 15.7 per cent for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at
end-March 1997, has declined by more than two thirds to 5.2 per cent at end-March
2005 (Table 7). Net NPLs also witnessed a significant decline, driven by the
improvements in loan loss provisioning and improved recovery management, which
comprises over half of the total provisions and contingencies. Capital adequacy of the
banking sector also recorded a marked improvement and reached 12.8 per cent at end-
March 2005, well above the stipulated level of 9 per cent. Banks have also been
sensitised to develop robust risk management systems for credit and operational risks
and focus on their asset-liability maturity profile to withstand adverse movements in
market risk parameters such as interest rates and take corrective measures.

Another heartening development in banks’ balance sheets, driven by the twin
forces of international accounting irregularities and regulatory initiatives has been the
increasing focus on corporate governance. As part of their Annual Report, banks9
presently disclose, under the head ‘Report on corporate governance’, details of their
boards of directors, number of board meetings attended by members, details of the
various sub-committees of the boards and provided the banks are listed, information on
their stock price movements. This is complemented with the banks’ philosophy on
corporate governance and the enabling mechanisms undertaken by the banks to
achieve their philosophy. As you would be aware, such listing is an important component
of the process of ‘market discipline’, which complements the regulatory initiatives
undertaken by the authorities. To take the governance process in banks a step further,
we had some time back issued guidelines laying down transparent criteria for
determining the ‘fit and proper’ status of owners and directors in private banks. Given
our focus on a consultative approach to policy formulation, the document was posted on
the RBI website for encouraging a debate on this issue. Based on the feedback
received, the draft is being reviewed before final guidelines can be issued to banks.
The whole policy reform process has been designed to make the banking system
more market oriented to enable efficient price discovery and to induce greater internal
efficiency in the resource allocation process.  Thus, whereas the efforts in the 1960s,
1970s and 1980s were essentially devoted to financial deepening, the focus of reforms
in the past decade and a half has been engendering greater efficiency and productivity
in the banking system in particular, and in the financial sector as a whole.  How well
have we succeeded?
4. Efficiency and productivity analysis in banking
In recent times, a significant body of literature has evolved which explores the
performance of financial institutions in the wake of financial liberalisation. These studies
are essentially micro-economic in nature and seek to analyse the efficiency and
productivity of banking systems. Such analysis is of relevance from the policy
standpoint, because as the finance-growth literature suggests, if banks become better-
functioning entities, this is expected to be reflected in safety and soundness of the
financial system and ultimately, lead to increases in the rate of economic growth. More
importantly, such analysis is useful in enabling policymakers to identify the success or
failure of policy initiatives or, alternatively, highlight different strategies undertaken by
banking firms which contribute to their successes.
A priori, deregulation is expected to unleash competitive forces. Such
competition would, in turn, enable banks to alter their input and output mix, which when
combined with technological developments facilitates increase in output that raises
overall bank productivity and efficiency. Second, liberal entry of de novo private and
foreign banks as a part of the deregulation process is expected to raise bank efficiency,
productivity and technology levels, because de novo private/foreign banks are
associated with superior management practices and technology, which can be fruitfully
imbibed by those which are not. A third strand of thinking, borrowing from the public
choice framework, contends that different ownership structures may engender different
efficiency levels. The theoretical argument is straightforward: lack of capital market
discipline weakens owners’ control over management, enabling the latter to pursue their
own interests, and provides fewer incentives for them to be efficient. Finally, as banking
in the current world is technology driven and technological progress itself is scale
augmenting, the relationship between bank size and efficiency becomes important.
Skeptics, on the contrary, argue that deregulation is, in general, accompanied by an
increase in banks' operational cost and could induce financial fragility due to over-10
expansion of banking activity. Thus, productivity gains after deregulation could be
temporary and not sustainable in the long run. As a result, evidence in support of a
unidirectional relationship between deregulation and efficiency/productivity is not
conclusive.
 Besides various methods of estimation, the efficiency and productivity studies in
banking are constrained by the absence of precise definitions of inputs and outputs of
banks. As a result, several approaches exist and the appropriateness of each approach
varies according to the circumstances (Box II).
Box II
Inputs and outputs of commercial banks
Banks are typically multi-input and multi-output firms. As a result, defining what
constitutes ‘input’ and ‘output’ is fraught with difficulties, since many of the financial services are
jointly produced and prices are typically assigned to a bundle of financial services. Additionally,
banks may not be homogeneous with respect to the types of outputs actually produced. In view of
these complexities, four approaches have come to dominate the literature on banking output: the
production approach, the intermediation approach, the operating (income-based) approach and
more recently, the modern approach.
Under the production approach, banks are primarily viewed as providers of services to
customers. The input set under this approach includes physical variables (e.g., labour, material,
space or information systems) and the outputs represent the services provided to customers and
are best measured by the number of deposit and loan accounts.
Under the intermediation approach, financial institutions are viewed as intermediating
funds between savers and investors. Banks produce intermediation services through the
collection of deposits and other liabilities and their application in interest-earning assets, such as
loans, securities and other investments. This approach includes both operating and interest
expenses as inputs, whereas loans and other major assets count as outputs. In principle, there
are three variant of intermediation approach, viz., the asset approach, the user cost approach and
value-added approach. The asset approach is a reduced form modelling of the banking activity,
focusing exclusively on the role of banks as financial intermediaries between depositors and final
uses of bank assets. Deposits and other liabilities, together with real resources (labor and
physical capital) are defined as inputs, whereas the output set includes earning assets such as
loans and investments. The user cost approach determines whether a financial product is an
input or an output on the basis of its net contribution to bank revenue. If the financial returns on
an asset exceed the opportunity cost of the funds or alternately, if the financial costs of a liability
are less than the opportunity cost, they are considered as outputs; otherwise, they are considered
as inputs. The value-added approach identifies major categories of produced deposits and loans
as outputs because they form a significant proportion of value added.
The operating approach (or income-based approach) views banks as business units with
the final objective of generating revenue from the total cost incurred for running the business.
Accordingly, it defines banks’ output as the total revenue (interest and non-interest) and inputs as
the total expenses (interest and operating expenses).
Finally, the modern approach seeks to integrate some measure for risk, agency costs
4
and quality of bank services. In this approach, the individual components of CAMEL are derived
from the financial tables of the banks and are used as variables in the performance analysis.

Competition and profitability of Indian banks
Beginning from 1992, Indian banks were gradually exposed to the rigours of
domestic and international competition. Newly opened banks from the private sector and
entry and expansion of several foreign banks resulted in greater competition in both
deposit and credit markets. Consequent to these developments, there has been a
consistent decline in the share of public sector banks in total assets of commercial
banks. The evidence of competitive pressure is well supported from the declining trend
5
of Herfindahl’s concentration index (Table 8). Notwithstanding such transformation, the
public sector banks still remain the mainstay, accounting for nearly three-fourths of
assets and income. It is also important to note that public sector banks have responded
to the new challenges of competition, as reflected in the increase in the share of these
banks in the overall profit of the banking sector. From the position of net loss in the mid-
1990s, in recent years the share of public sector banks in the profit of the commercial
banking system has become broadly commensurate with their share in assets, indicating
a broad convergence of profitability across various bank groups. This suggests that, with
operational flexibility, public sector banks are competing relatively effectively with private
sector and foreign banks. The ‘market discipline’ imposed by the listing of most public
sector banks has also probably contributed to this improved performance. Public sector
bank managements are now probably more attuned to the market consequences of their
activities (Mohan, 2005).

Since the late1990s, in line with the benign interest rate regime, both interest
income and interest expenditure of banks as proportions of total assets have declined.
However, interest expenditure declined faster than interest income, resulting in an
increase in net interest income. However, non-interest income, which emanates mostly
from fee-based activities, has been increasing consistently in the post-reform period. For
example, non-interest income as a proportion of total assets of the banking sector
increased from 1.2 per cent in 1993 to more than 2 per cent in 2004 (Table 9). In this
context, it is also appropriate to mention that Indian banks, in particular the public sector
banks, are yet to catch-up fully with their foreign counterparts.

Efficiency of Indian banks
Improvements in efficiency of the banking system are expected to be reflected,
inter alia, in a reduction in operating expenditure, interest spread and cost of
intermediation in general. Several indicators have been employed in the literature to
compare banking production costs across time. Illustratively, intermediation cost, defined
as the ratio of operating expense to total assets, witnessed a gradual reduction in the
post reform period across various bank groups barring foreign banks (Table 10). This
decline in intermediation cost needs to be weighed against the large expenditures
incurred in upgradation of information technology and institution of ‘core banking’
solutions. Admittedly, intermediation costs of banks in India still tend to be higher than
those in developed banking markets.

At a more disaggregated level, it is evident that Indian banks have improved
their efficiency in the post reform period as evidenced from the declining trend in per unit
cost of output, irrespective of the choice of outputs (Table 11). The operating cost per
unit of earning assets declined from 2.1 per cent in 1992 to 1.8 per cent in 2004;
similarly, operating cost per unit of total volume of business declined from 3.4 per cent to
2.6 per cent during the same period. Among the components of operating expenses,
employee cost per unit of output witnessed a noticeable decline in the post-reform
period. This decline is discernible across all bank groups, and especially for public sector
banks in the post 2001 period consequent to the voluntary retirement scheme across
several nationalised banks. On the other hand, the change in physical capital cost per
unit of output has been marginal, reflecting the fact that Indian banks maintained a
steady flow of investments towards physical capital formation, especially on automation
and information technology.

From the efficiency standpoint, the intermediation cost needs to be viewed in
conjunction with non-interest income. Till 2001, the burden (the excess of non-interest
expenditure over non-interest income as a percentage to total assets) of commercial
banks hovered around 1 to 1.5 per cent (Table 12). This gap between intermediation

Total operating cost can be broken down into labor cost and cost of physical capital. To create
per unit cost measure, we deflate the operating cost and its two components by either (i) the total
earning assets (deposits plus investments), which is justified by the asset approach in measuring
banking outputs, or (ii) the aggregate of advances and deposits, which can be justified by the
value-added approach in measuring banking outputs.14
cost and income from fee-based activities has narrowed considerably in recent years.
For example, the burden of Indian commercial banks declined from 1.2 per cent in 1992
to 0.2 per cent in 2004. Moreover, there has been a lowering of the burden across bank
groups in recent years. The improvement in respect of Indian private banks has been
remarkable; their non-interest income in recent years has surpassed their intermediation
cost and has resulted in a negative burden.

The cost income-ratio (defined as the ratio of operating expenses to total income
less interest expense) of Indian banks showed a declining trend during the post reform
period. For example, Indian banks paid roughly 45 per cent of their net income towards
managing labour and physical capital in 2004 as against nearly 72 per cent in 1993
(Table 13). In other words, Indian banks recorded a net cost saving of nearly 27 per cent
of their net income during the post reform period. According to the data reported in The
Banker 2004, the cost-income ratio of world’s largest banks varied markedly from a low
of 48 per cent to a high of 116 percent and the ratio around 60 per cent is an indicative
benchmark (RBI, 2005). In that respect, the cost-income ratio of Indian banks is now
comparable internationally. Among various ownership patterns, public sector banks have
tended to have relatively higher cost-income ratio as against private banks and foreign
banks.
This explanation needs to be viewed in conjunction with the differential ownership
profile of banks. Early studies (Sarkar et al., 1998) found somewhat weak evidence to
suggest that ownership was an important determinant of performance. More recent
studies exhibit mixed evidence: while certain studies (Keova, 2003) suggest ownership
to have some effect on bank performance, others (e.g., Bhaumik and Dimova, 2004)
veer around the view that competition induced public sector banks to eliminate the
performance gap that existed between them and both domestic and foreign and private
sector banks. More recent research reported differences in the efficiency of Indian
commercial banks with different ownership status, level of non-performing loans, size
and asset quality (Das and Ghosh, 2006). More importantly, their study uncovered
evidence that public sector banks (PSBs) recorded higher efficiency gains in the post-15
reform period. Clearly, the evidence here is not conclusive, because comparisons are
beset with several difficulties. Given the size and variety of PSBs, it is possible to find
banks that could equal the good private sector banks as well as bad ones. In addition,
PSBs have to reckon with ‘legacy’ problems, such as many of the non-performing assets
that they have been saddled with. Some PSBs operate in relatively backward areas with
limited discretion to pull out from such areas. The question still remains: whether there is
a better payoff in enabling PSBs to improve their performance while promoting private
sector banks, as compared with an alternative policy that provides for transfer of
ownership and control from the public to the private sector. Will greater scope for
mergers and acquisitions within and between public and private sector add to greater
efficiency?

Another important indicator of efficiency of banks is net interest margin (NIM),
defined as the excess of interest income over interest expense, scaled by total bank
assets. Broadly speaking, this ratio reflects the allocative efficiency of financial
intermediation, a lower ratio being indicative of higher efficiency. It is quite reasonable to
believe that the decline in deposit rates ushered by the deregulation process will be
manifested in the lending behaviour of banks. In practice, however, lending rates have
tended to be sticky downwards and seem to operate with a time lag. Historically the NIM
of Indian banks is rather high. Around the onset of the reform process in 1992, the NIM
of Indian banks was about 3.3 percent (Table 14). Thereafter, it recorded a relatively
modest decline to around 3 per cent in recent years. And traditionally, it is the foreign
banks, which by virtue of their ability to mobilise low-cost deposits, have the highest
NIMs, whereas those for private banks have been the lowest in recent years. These
comparisons are not watertight: typically, small and medium banks had high NIM until
7
1997. Thereafter, NIM for big banks recorded a rise. Contextually, it may be mentioned

 Definitions of small, medium and big banks are as follows: small banks are those with asset
upto Rs.50 billion; medium banks are those with asset exceeding Rs.50 billion  and upto Rs.100
billion; big banks are those with asset exceeding Rs.100 billion but and upto Rs.200 billion; and
large banks are those with asset exceeding Rs.200 billion.16
that banks in most developed countries and several emerging economies have NIM (as
a percentage to total assets) of around 2 per cent. This provides some indication that
competition in banking still has some way to go in India.

Productivity
Studies on productivity in Indian banking have only begun to emanate of late. A
recent study found that total factor productivity growth has improved marginally in the
post deregulation period, but there was little evidence of narrowing of productivity
differentials across ownership categories following deregulation (Kumbhakar and Sarkar,
2003). Among various productivity indicators, labour productivity indicators like business
per employee and profit per employee are most commonly used. In addition, business
per branch is also used to judge branch-level productivity. The business per employee of
Indian banks increased over three-fold in real terms from Rs.5.4 million in 1992 to
Rs.16.3 million in 2004, exhibiting an annual compound growth rate of nearly 9 per cent
(Table 15). At the same time, the profit per employee increased more than five-fold: from
Rs.20,000 to Rs. 150,000 over the same period, implying a compound growth of around
17 per cent. Branch productivity also recorded concomitant improvements. Overall, the
balance of evidence suggests distinctive productivity improvements in the banking sector
over the reform period. The extant literature suggests that such improvements could be
driven by two factors: technological improvement, which expands the range of
production possibilities and a catching up effect, as peer pressure amongst banks
compels them to raise productivity levels. In the context of gradual deregulation of
financial sector, several factors could have been at work: a significant shift of the best-
practice frontier, driven by a combination of technological advances, financial innovation
and different strategies pursued by banks suited to their business philosophy and risk-
return profile, changing composition of banks’ input–output, and reduction in total cost
due to improvements in overall efficiency. While it is difficult to pinpoint the relative mix
of these factors in raising productivity, the bottomline is clear: Indian banks witnessed
significant productivity improvements, post-reforms.17

In a wider framework, cross-country studies of deregulation and productivity
growth of banks report divergent views. Typically, cross-country comparisons are often
fraught with difficulties, not only because of the different regulatory and economic
regimes encountered by financial entities, but also owing to the differential quality of
services associated with deposits and loans in different countries. Maudos and Pastor
(2001) analysed the cost and profit efficiency across 14 EU economies, as well as Japan
and the USA. The results uncovered the evidence that, since the start of the 1990s
increasing competition has led to gains in profit efficiency in the USA and Europe but not
so in the Japanese banking system. Their results also show that the variance in of
profitability between countries would be considerably reduced if inefficiencies were
eliminated, efficiency gains thus being a very important source of improvement in
profitability. A recent study in the Asian context analysed various efficiency measures of
South-East Asian (Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand) banks in the
context of corporate governance (Williams and Nguyen, 2005). Although the motivation
of the study was different, their empirical results found economic justification for the
policy of bank privatisation.
Let me encapsulate this section by making some general comments on the
efficiency and productivity growth of Indian banks vis-à-vis leading Asian nations like
China and Korea. As far as real growth (adjusted for price movement and exchange rate
fluctuations) in banking business is concerned, Indian banks are favourably placed. In
recent years, the real growth of deposits and of loans of Indian banks were noticeably
higher than those of other Asian countries such as China and Korea. At the same time,
profitability of Indian banks, as determined by the return on assets, is also much higher
(Tables 16, 17, 18 and 19). The intermediation cost of Indian banks seems to be
relatively higher than that of Korea and China. Nonetheless, higher operating cost in
India is well compensated by the higher non-interest income, as compared to other
Asian countries. Finally, the labour productivity of the top 4 banks in India (which
includes one de novo private bank) and the four state-owned Chinese banks indicates
that except the private bank, the top three public sector banks in India recorded much
lower employee productivity. However, in the absence of data on employment for banks18
in other countries, it is difficult to ascertain the degree of labour productivity differentials
across countries.

A clear message emanating from these findings is the role of technology in
driving productivity and efficiency improvements. In today's world of banking, technology
is considered as the basic tool of the "process engineers" of the organisation. It is crucial
for the design, control, and execution of service delivery in banks. Therefore, a key
driver of efficiency and productivity in the banking industry today is the effective use of
technology. This is a crucial pre-requisite for capitalising on future opportunities for the
banking sector. In effect, it has become the key to servicing all customer segments –
offering convenience to retail customer, corporates and government clients. The
increasing sophistication, flexibility and complexity of products and servicing offerings
makes the effective use of technology critical for managing the risks associated with
banking business. However, the ‘technological penetration’ in India has been quite
modest. According to data reported in the World Development Indicators database, as of
2002, the number of computers per 1000 persons was about 7 in India compared to
anywhere between 70-500 in most emerging markets and even higher in most
9
developed economies. Wide disparities exist within the banking sector as far as
technological capabilities are concerned: the percentage of ‘computer literate’
employees as percentage of total staff in 2000 was around 20 per cent in public sector
banks compared with 100 per cent in new private and around 90 per cent in foreign
banks (Reserve Bank of India, 2002). Data reported by the RBI suggests that nearly 71
per cent of branches of public sector banks are fully computerized. However,
computerization needs to go beyond the mere ‘arithmeticals’, to borrow a term from the
Report of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Government of India, 1998), and
instead, needs to be leveraged optimally to achieve and maintain high service and
efficiency standards. In fact, recent research on the role of technology in driving
productivity improvements in banking demonstrates that computer employees and IT
capital exhibit higher productivities than their respective non-computer employees and
non-IT capital, respectively (Huang, 2005). The challenge, therefore, remains three fold:
acquiring the ‘right’ technology, deploying it optimally and remaining cost-effective whilst
delivering sustainable returns to shareholders. In effect, ‘managing’ technology so as to
reap the maximum benefits remains a key challenge for the Indian banks.

5. Way Ahead
How do we see the future? In this context, I would like to share with you some of
the issues that need to be kept in view while discussing productivity and efficiency in
banks.  Needless to state, these issues remain relevant, in varying degrees, in
economies that share similar features in the banking sector, as ours.
First, many of you would be aware that small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
constitute an important segment of the industrial and services sectors in India in view of
their significant contributions to employment generation as also exports. With the
emergence of new activities in the rural segment such as agri-clinics, contract farming
and rural housing with forward and backward linkages to SMEs, lending to SMEs has
become a viable revenue proposition for banks. The Reserve Bank has also initiated
several measures to streamline the flow of credit and address structural bottlenecks in
credit delivery to this segment. Salient among these include fixing of self-set targets for
financing, rationalisation of cost of loans, expanding the outreach of formal credit, and
formulation of comprehensive and more liberal policies for credit extension. Public sector
banks have also been advised to constitute specialized SME branches in identified
clusters/centers with preponderance of small and medium enterprises. A noteworthy
development in this context has been the passage of the Credit Information Companies
(Regulation) Act, 2005 in the Parliament. The Act is expected to encourage setting up of
credit information companies and thereby, improve exchange of information on credit
histories of borrowers. Coupled with appropriate risk assessment models and
mechanisms, this is expected to lower transactions costs of banks. The overall effect of
this process is likely to be reflected in a lowering of the risk premium embedded in
interest rates charged to SMEs with positive spillovers for bank lending to the SME
sector.
Although liberalisation of financial services and competition has improved
customer services, experience shows that customers' interests are not always accorded
priority. More importantly, concerns have been raised with regard to banking practices
that tend to exclude vast segments of the population. In this context, the Reserve Bank
has announced its intention to implement policies to incentivise banks to provide
extensive services responsive to the needs of the under-privileged. As part of the
process, the Reserve Bank has recently advised all banks to make available a basic
banking ‘no frills’ account either with ‘nil’ or very low minimum balances as well as
charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of population. The
nature and number of transactions in such accounts could be restricted, but made
known to the customer in advance in a transparent manner. Banks have been urged to
give wide publicity to this facility so as to ensure greater financial inclusion.
The growth performance of the Indian economy during the last few years
indicates a possible ratcheting up of the trend rate of growth from around 6 per cent to
around 8 per cent per year. Yet, there is a need to undertake significant efforts to
achieve higher rates of growth in a sustained manner. The current levels of investment
might not be adequate to achieve such growth rates, even after accounting for
reductions in the existing incremental capital-output ratios. Looking beyond the aspect of
fiscal consolidation, action on several fronts needs to be pursued vigorously to step up
growth rates. First is the issue of investment in agriculture and allied activities, a sector
that produces 21 per cent of GDP, but supports nearly 60 per cent of the population.21
There is often substantial loss of output owing to inadequate storage and transport
facilities and paucity of adequate food processing capacities. This necessitates greater
public and private investment on these post-harvest facilities to not only increase value
addition, but also to improve the agriculture-industry linkage. The second issue of import
is the simplification of procedures. Cumbersome procedural formalities introduce delays
and results in significant output losses. Added to these, the de-reservation of items from
exclusive production under SSI units is likely to permit the sector reap economies of
scale and scope and enhance competitiveness. The third is the issue of finances. The
incipient investment boom in infrastructure, industry and services will yield best results
only if enormous resource flows are successfully intermediated at a low cost. This will
depend on the ability of the financial sector to process information properly and to
intermediate the extant savings into optimal investment by specific firms and sectors.
The fourth aspect of stepping up investment is to address the deficiencies in
infrastructure. The decline in public spending on infrastructure has not been adequately
compensated by the private sector, possibly owing to difficulties in the regulatory
environment. Therefore, nurturing an appropriate policy framework, with a conducive
environment for public-private participation, remains the key to accelerating investment
in infrastructure. The final aspect is the need to complement domestic investment with
higher foreign investment, primarily in the form of FDI. Such investment is likely to trigger
technology spillovers, assist human capital formation and more generally, improve the
efficiency of resource use.
Over the reform period, more and more banks have begun to get listed on the
stock exchange, which, in its wake, has led to greater market discipline and
concomitantly, to an improvement in their governance aspects as well. This has led to a
broadbasing of the ownership of PSBs. Such diversification of ownership has also led to
a qualitative difference in their functioning, since there is induction of private
shareholding as well as attendant issues of shareholder’s value, as reflected by the
market capitalisation, board representation and interests of minority shareholders
(Reddy, 2002). The issue of mixed ownership as an institutional structure where
government has controlling interest is a salient feature of bank governance in India.
Such aspects of corporate governance in PSBs is important, not only because PSBs
dominate the banking industry, but also because, it is likely that they would continue to
remain in banking business. To the extent there is public ownership of PSBs, the
multiple objectives of the government as owner and the complex principal-agent
relationships needs to be taken on board. Given the increased technical complexity of
most business activities including banking and the rapid pace of change in financial
markets and practices, PSBs would need to devise imaginative ways of responding to
the evolving challenges within the context of mixed ownership. All in all, this is an
exciting phase for PSBs to grow and prosper, and it is up to these banks to respond to
the challenges.
Let me conclude: the address has have traversed a modest terrain, focusing on
the efficiency and productivity changes in Indian banking. The patterns of efficiency and
technological change witnessed in Indian banking can be viewed as consistent with
expectations in an industry undergoing rapid change in response to the forces of
deregulation. In reaction to evolving market prospects, a few pioneering banks might
adjust quickly to seize the emerging opportunities, while others respond cautiously. As
deregulation gathers momentum, commercial banks would need to devise imaginative
ways of augmenting their incomes and more importantly their fee-incomes so as to raise
efficiency and productivity levels.22
