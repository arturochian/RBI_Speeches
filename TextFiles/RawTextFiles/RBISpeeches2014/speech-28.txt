Framework for the conduct of macroprudential policy  
in India: experiences and perspectives
K C. Chakrab
Deputy Governor
Reserve Bank of India
In India, we have a relatively long history of experience with conduct of macroprudential policy. 
The Reserve Bank has, over the years, attempted to address systemic risks in both its dimensions – the time 
dimension or procyclicality, and the cross sectional dimension – within a macroprudential framework.
The article will review India’s experiences/experiments with macroprudential policy prior to the crisis, during 
the crisis and more recently, the experience of using countercyclical policy to address the challenges 
posed by a sharp increase in volatility of exchange rates together with a heightened external deficit. 
The use of macroprudential policy in India has been extensive and multi?faceted – spanning the banking 
and non?banking financial sector; addressing asset price spirals and credit booms; encompassing capital 
flows and systemic liquidity management; dealing with large and complex financial institutions; calibrating 
the development of the OTC derivative markets; and tackling interconnectedness in the banking and 
financial sector and between the financial and the real sector.
The article will also touch upon the institutional arrangements for financial stability in India, pre and post 
the crisis. Prior to the crisis, no agency was explicitly granted a mandate for financial stability though 
the Reserve Bank acted as the implicit systemic regulator. Post crisis, institutional arrangements have 
been strengthened with the setting up of an inter?agency Financial Stability and Development Council.
The article will finally attempt to present the lessons emanating from India’s experience with operationalising 
a macroprudential policy framework, especially with regard to some of the major emerging questions 
– signal extraction, use of rules versus discretion in policy making, coordination with other policy 
segments (primarily monetary policy), assessing the impact of the policy measures, etc. It will then touch 
upon some of the challenges, viz. developing a framework for systemic risk assessment, assessing and 
plugging data gaps, and also focus on the challenges for extending the scope of macroprudential policy 
beyond the financial sector to the corporate sector, specifically for managing risks arising out of corporate 
leverage and unhedged foreign exchange exposures, and to the sovereigns.

Framework for systemic risk assessment 
A number of initiatives have been taken to improve the financial stability analytics in RBI. Some of these are outlined below. 
Stability indicators and maps 
Stability indicators and maps represent coincident indicators of systemic stress in the financial system. They are 
constructed by aggregating information from different segments of the overall financial system and encapsulating the 
information in a single statistic which measures the current state of instability in the financial system. 
RBI has been using a variety of stability maps and indicators to assess trends in risk dimensions of various aspects of 
the macrofinancial system – the banking sector, the macroeconomy, financial markets, the corporate sector, etc. Each of 
these indicators is based on contemporaneous developments in different risk factors. A systemic liquidity indicator has 
also been developed to gauge the degree of stress in domestic liquidity conditions and to establish time frames for 
potential extreme events. 
Banking stability measures and expected shortfall 
Banking stability measures, a cross?sectional econometric framework, capture the distress dependencies among 
financial firms using stock price data and attempt to estimate the contribution of individual firms to systemic risk. 
A banking stability index is calculated, which captures the expected number of banks to become distressed given that 
at least one bank has become distressed. Separate toxicity and vulnerability indices capture distress between specific 
institutions while the cascade effect attempts to measure the distress in the system associated with the distress of a 
specific institutions. This method is also being used for estimation of expected shortfall of assets of banking system 
in response to a large negative shock.

Network analysis 
The techniques of network modelling have been used to develop a bespoke financial network analysis and contagion 
stress testing platform for the Indian financial system. The analysis primarily looks into the interconnections that exists 
between different institutions in the financial system and tries to identify the build?up of systemic risks. Graphical network 
representations have been developed which are being used to assess the degree of system level interconnectedness 
and the stability of the system. A contagion simulator helps in assessing the possible loss of capital to the financial 
system due to a random failure of one or more financial institutions. Both the solvency and liquidity effects of failure 
of a financial entity are assessed.
Macrofinancial stress tests 
RBI conducts a variety of macro stress testing exercises at regular periodicities. The first set of stress testing exercises 
uses multivariate regression tools to evaluate the impact of a particular macroeconomic variable on the asset quality of 
banks and their capital adequacy ratio at the system level. The second set is based on a vector autoregressive (VAR) 
model which assesses the impact of the overall economic stress situation on the asset quality and capital adequacy 
of the banking system taking into account the feedback effect of the macroeconomic performance of the economy on 
banks’ stability. The third set uses quantile regression techniques to model system level slippage ratio with macrovariables 
in the tails. Multivariate regressions and panel regressions are also used for projections/stress testing for various sector 
as well as at bank group level.
In order to improve the assessment of projected NPAs on the capital, a model based on time series econometric tool 
has been developed to project profit of banks under different macroeconomic scenarios. The projected values of the 
ratio of the non?performing advances are translated into capital ratios using the “balance sheet approach”, by which 
capital in the balance sheet is affected via the provisions and net profits.
