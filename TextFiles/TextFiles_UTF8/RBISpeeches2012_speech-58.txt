Three basic dimensions of an inclusive financial system ? Banking penetration ? size of the banked population, i.e., number of adult population having a bank account ? number of bank accounts as a proportion of the total population ? Availability of the banking services ? number of bank outlets & ATMs (per 1000 population) ? number of bank branches per 1000 adult population and also number of branches per square km ? Usage of the banking system ? merely having a bank account does not ensure that the system is inclusive; adequate utilization is imperative ? volume of outstanding deposit and credit as proportion of the Net District Domestic Product 6State-wise Index of financial Inclusion Kerala,  High Financial Inclusion Maharashtra, Karnataka The all-India level falls Tamil Nadu, Punjab,  in the medium FI  Medium Financial Inclusion Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim,  category Himachal Pradesh, Haryana West Bengal, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh,  Meghalaya, Tripura, Odisha, Rajasthan,  Low Financial Inclusion Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Madhya  Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Nagaland,  Manipur (Source: RBI Working Paper on Financial Inclusion in India : A case-study of West Bengal by Sadhan Kumar 7 Chattopadhyay)Need to focus on Policies, Partnership, Processes & Products relating to ?

Savings-first, credit later model ? credit discipline social collateral made SHGs bankable. ? For banks dealing with groups of people meant ? reducing in transaction costs, ? reducing the credit risks through peer pressure and ? making people save ? Challenges ? inadequate outreach in many regions, delays in opening of SHG accounts and disbursement of loans, impounding of savings by banks as collateral 9SHG-2 ? More focus on voluntary savings ? Cash credit system of lending over 3 to 5 years cycle ? to minimize the problem of inadequate finance and non-availability of repeat loans ? Enabling creation of Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) within SHGs ? to scale up economic activities by more entrepreneurial members ? Improving risk mitigation systems by bringing in third party audit ? Building second tier institutions ? Strengthening the monitoring mechanism ? Addressing training requirements 10Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) ? Graduated from an experiment to a well-accepted paradigm of rural and developmental financing in India. ? MFIs have served the underserved/un-served populace and improved access to credit ? debate on their style of corporate governance and ethics of conducting business ? To sustain existence, business and credibility, MFIs must ? revisit their business model profitability vs. profiteering ? re-engineer the customer responsive processes ? revisit business strategy ? reinvent the sector as a community relevant to public and policy 11 supportBusiness Correspondents ? Recommendations of the Internal Group to examine issues relating to rural credit and microfinance ? Business Facilitators (BFs) and Business Correspondents (BCs) for ensuring door step delivery of financial products and services ? Expansion of BC universe ? Owned by corporates ? Owned by banks ? Ultra-small centres of banks ? simple brick & mortar structure located between base branch and BC locations ? terminal linked to CBS and a pass book printer ? Interoperability of BCs ? a customer can approach any BC ? allow BCs of one bank to service customers of other banks 12 ? transactions and authentications are carried out online on CBS platformIssues & challenges  ? Viability of the model ? need for more products and more innovations ? Remuneration of BCs ? Technology related issues ? Banks exposed to multiple risks ? credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk ? Mis-selling of financial products to uninformed & illiterate consumers ? Conflict of interest in case of corporate BCs ? Difficulty in replacing the BCs ? Cash management ? people not willing to deposit huge amounts with the BCs 13Possible solutions ? Deeper engagement of banks ? at the corporate and the local levels ? Hand-holding by banks by way of orientation/training ? Expanding the BC network ? cluster approach (?) ? Redesigning existing/introduction of innovative products ? No Frill Accounts (NFA) replaced by Basic Bank Account ? Micro-insurance products bundled with savings/credit products ? Appropriate financial literacy initiatives ? Awareness about customer grievance redressal mechanism 14Tapping technology platform ? Key to providing models for efficient delivery of small value transactions in large volumes ? while reaping economies of scale. ? Helps in spreading financial literacy ? both as a delivery channel and as an intrinsic part of the learning process ? Various platform to choose from ? Smart cards, micro-ATMs, ATMs ? Mobile technology 15 ? Aadhar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS)Tapping technology platform ? Experimentation with mobile based remittance services for reaching the unbanked population ? M-Pesa (Kenya), Tigo Cash (Paraguay), Pago Movi (Peru), Nipper (Mexico), (Oi) Brazil ? deployment of technology to service low income, financially excluded households ? Common thread ? most schemes use mobile phones ? others use point-of-sale devices in conjunction with magnetic stripe cards (mostly in Latin America), ? some use both mobile phones and point-of-sale devices (WIZZIT in 16 South Africa and Smart in the Philippines).Mobile banking ? Defined as undertaking banking transactions using mobile phones by bank customers that involve credit/debit to their accounts ? Rapid growth in the number of mobile phone subscribers in India ? banks in collaboration with telecom companies have developed an alternate channel of delivery of banking services ? Value and volume are increasing ? growth rate is low when compared with the mobile subscriber base ? banks are yet to fully exploit this technology ? Tapping the potential for financial inclusion ? bank-led mobile banking model for achieving financial inclusion 17Mobile banking ? Mobile Network Operator (MNO) based approach ? Limitations and concerns (e.g. Safricom) ? Banks & MNOs collaborative relationship is preferable ? Reserve Bank has provided the policy framework ? Plausible reasons for low levels of collaboration ? ownership of the customer, control of transactions and developing an appropriate revenue sharing model ? Expectations from banks and mobile operators ? arrive at appropriate decisions while protecting their mutual interests ? a win win situation for both and serve the larger public good of 18 financial inclusionInter-bank Mobile Payment Service (IMPS) ? Instantaneous 24x7 electronic funds transfer system ?

The USSD platform is menu driven and can be invoked by dialing a number. ? users with low-cost handsets can perform their banking transactions through the mobiles (not necessarily smartphones) 19Measures to encourage m-banking ? Cap of ` 50,000/- for mobile banking transactions removed ? banks to put in place caps based on their risk perceptions. ? Domestic Money Transfer Scheme ? transfer of funds among domestic debit/credit/pre-paid cards up to ` 10,000 with a monthly cap of` 25,000/- ? balances on mobile wallets can be transferred to other mobile wallets offered by the same company ? balances can also be transferred to the bank account of the beneficiary from which cash can be withdrawn 20Aadhar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS) ?

Empowers a bank customer to use Aadhaar as his/her identity to ? access the respective Aadhaar enabled bank account and ? perform basic banking transactions like balance enquiry, cash withdrawal and deposit through a BC ? Pilot scheme in 4 districts of Jharkhand state ? MGNREGA wages to labourers credited to their Adhaar enabled accounts ? beneficiaries withdraw the amounts through Micro ATMs which authenticate their Aadhaar number 21Challenges in using technology ? Major constraint has been the technology itself ? Non-functional hand-held machines, smart cards, network connectivity and availability of power ? Limited number of technology service providers to cover the unbanked villages of all banks ? Limited service centres for servicing these devices has resulted in banking operations coming to a halt in many villages ? Leading to an erosion of confidence on the ICT-based BC model 22Challenges in using technology ? Adequate attention to security features ? preventing fraud through robust security measures but not losing sight at ease and efficiency in operations ? ensuring proper balance between assurance and accessibility ? Measures taken by Reserve Bank of India ? Second Factor Authentication ? exists for Card Not Present (CNP) transactions ? in the offing for the Card Present (CP) transaction  chip & pin or Aadhar ? encryption of mobile based transactions for value above `5,000/- 23Challenges in using technology ? Infrastructural limitation ? poor internet connectivity slows the pace of banking transactions ? Technology challenges for smaller banks like RRBs/Co-op Banks ? CBS linkages through sponsor banks ? NABARD lending a helping hand ? Financial Inclusion Technology Fund ? Contribution of NPCI e.g. Ru Pay ? Satellite Connectivity Scheme for the NE States ? Reserve Bank offers subsidy to branches in the NE states offering services of electronic funds transfer free of charge to their customers 24Challenges in using technology ? Banks require partnership and collaboration with other stakeholders ? standardization and inter-operability ? technology service providers, mobile network operators, corporate houses and BCs ? For significant investment in ? technology applications ? R&D efforts ? monitoring and evaluation system ? To develop delivery models ? one private sector bank has approved a mobile service provider to act as its BC and provide services to the unbanked 25Way forward ? Banks & Technology Service Providers (TSPs) need to develop new product lines ? rather than merely adopting complex products of urban India ? Mobile POS, micro-ATMs, Pre-paid instruments, mobile enabled KCC, variable instalment RD, gold linked products, micro-pension, etc. ? provide simple and basic banking services ? requires easy-to-understand documentation process ? Move from assisted to self-service model in a calibrated manner ? More focus on innovative ideas to enhance the staying power of the poor 26Way forward ? Policy objective of inclusive growth with financial stability cannot be achieved without ensuring universal financial inclusion ? Requires collaboration between across governments, regulators, industry associations and other stakeholders ? Coordinated national strategy is needed for success of the financial inclusion initiatives ? Spreading awareness about ? financial inclusion ? tap innovative dissemination channels ? training the grass-root level staff of banks/BCs/TSPs ? financial technology ? e-BAAT  Electronic Banking Awareness And Training 27Way forward For evolving an effective financial inclusion delivery model ?

Sound & strong institutions can deliver financial inclusion ? Leveraging technology service providers ? Mobile network owners forging partnerships with banks ? Prudent measures ? Restricting deposit taking to banks ? NBFCs encouraged to focus on innovative approaches to lending ? Bankability of the poor holds a major business opportunity ? develops a stable retail deposit base ? curbs volatility with a diversified asset portfolio ? expands the scope for sale of third party products (e.g. micro- insurance, pension, mutual funds, etc.) 30Concluding thoughts ? Financial inclusion has to be a subset of wider economic inclusion ? important to generate revenue for economic inclusion for sustainable inclusion ? financial inclusion would be possible if there is a felt need for financial services ? banks need to have both model and motivation to convert this to sustainable business opportunities Financial inclusion is about viable and sustainable business models with focus on accessible and affordable products and processes, synergistic partnerships with technology service providers for efficient handling of low value, large volume transactionsandappropriateregulatoryandriskmanagementpolicies thatensurefinancialinclusionandfinancialstabilitymoveintandem. 31In all our efforts towards financial inclusion we should not forget  Financial inclusion is not about giving handouts to anyone, its aboutgettingthepeopletohelpthemselves Barry Whiteside Thank you
