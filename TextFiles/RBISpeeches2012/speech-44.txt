Economic and Financial Developments in Odisha
 
I thank Shri Bijoy Ketan Mishra for inviting me to address this distinguished 
gathering. I am happy that The Political and Business Daily has chosen to highlight 
the role of banking in Odisha’s development. In the development of the financial 
sector, banks have a pivotal role.  Finance leads growth and economic progress 
follows.  As you know, the Reserve Bank has been actively engaged in the 
development of the financial sector. However, we have stepped up our efforts in the 
recent years to enhance the penetration of the formal financial sector and promote 
financial inclusion with a view to improving the well-being of our society.  
In my talk today, I propose to briefly outline the economic and financial 
structure of the State as well as highlight various financial inclusion initiatives taken 
by the Reserve Bank with a particular reference to Odisha. In conclusion, I shall 
present some thoughts on policy challenges that lie ahead. 
Odisha accounting for 4.7 per cent of the total geographical area of the country 
and 3.5 per cent of the national population has a unique place in the national history 
and culture.  Rather than going back on history, I will trace the economic development 
starting from the early 2000s mainly because this is a period in which the Indian 
economy experienced a quantum jump in growth rate. And obviously, growth was 
happening in various states including Odisha.  
Economic Structure 
During the 5-year period 2003-08, All-India GDP growth rate averaged 8.7 per 
cent per annum. In the subsequent 4-year period 2009-12 though All-India GDP 
growth rate moderated to 7.6 per cent per annum following the global financial crisis, 
it can still be considered high. It is noteworthy that coinciding with this high growth 
phase, the Odisha economy witnessed acceleration in its gross state domestic product

 (GSDP). In fact, in the earlier period during 2003-08, the average GSDP growth in 
Odisha at 11.6 per cent per annum far exceeded the national average. Subsequently, 
growth has moderated in Odisha to an annual average rate of 7.6 per cent, in line with 
the national level (Chart 1).

In this growth dynamics, three important aspects stand out.  First, in the earlier 
phase of 2003-08 growth was mainly led by industry. Second, in the latter phase of 
2009-12 growth was driven by the services sector. Third, in both the phases 
agricultural growth remained low and volatile (Chart 2).

 The varying growth trends are reflected in the compositional shift among 
sectors in the GSDP: the share of agriculture declined steadily; the share of industry 
first rose and then moderated and the share of services first declined and then rose. In 
this structural transformation of the Odisha economy, which is broadly consistent with 
the trend in the national economy, the rise in the share of industry is noteworthy 
(Chart 4).

national GDP from 2.3 per cent in 2002-03 to 2.7 per cent in 2008-09. As growth in 
GSDP slowed and converged to the national level, the share has since declined but 
remained steady around 2.6 per cent after 2008-09.   However, the most discerning 
impact can be seen in the rise of real (at 2004-05 prices) per capita NSDP from 
13,923 in 2002-03 to 25,708 in 2010-11. This has helped improve Odisha’s rank in 
rd
terms of per capita income among the states from the bottom 3 position in 2002-03 
th
to 7 in 2010-11. Notwithstanding this progress, Odisha’s per capital income is still 
lower than the national average (Chart 5).

While the economy is transferring towards industry and services, the labour 
force remains concentrated in agriculture.  As against the national average of around 
52 per cent of labour share in agriculture & forestry in 2010-11, the State has a much 
higher labour share of 59 per cent.  Furthermore, the share of manufacturing sector in 
the labour force remains lower compared to the national average despite the recent 
pick up in manufacturing activity (Table 1).  Moreover, labour force participation rate 
at around 50 per cent in 2010-11 was lower than the labour participation rate of 53 per 
cent at the national level.

Apart from the greater concentration of labour force in agriculture, the 
demographic structure of Odisha with a higher share of working age population is also 
favourably disposed towards growth (Chart 6). Hence, the major challenge for the 
state is to generate employment in industry and services so that labour force can be 
released from low productivity agriculture activity.  This will require improvement in 
the quality of labour force with higher expenditure in education and health.  In this 
regard, the private sector can play a major role in supplementing the government’s 
efforts in provision of higher education and health services.

Social Indicators 
Notwithstanding the rapid economic growth in the recent years, Odisha 
remains low in human development. With low urbanisation, lower per capita income, 
high incidence of poverty, high infant mortality and lower life expectancy rate as

compared with the national average, Odisha was ranked 22 among the 23 states in 
terms of Human Development Index 2007-08 (Chart 7).

2011.  Similarly ownership of household assets such as television, telephone and 
mechanised personal transport remains lower than the national average.  The 
population of households having banking facility, though improving, still remains 
lower than the national average (Table 2).

State Finances  
There was substantial improvement in state finances as Odisha achieved the 
targets set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL) well ahead of the 
stipulated time-frame. The revenue account turned surplus in 2005-06 followed by 
fiscal surplus in 2006-07. Although the fiscal position of Odisha had shown some 
deterioration in 2008-09 reflecting the combined impact of macroeconomic slowdown 
and sixth pay commission award, it has since reverted to the path of consolidation.  
With revenue surplus and moderate fiscal deficit, the need for market borrowings was 
low.  In fact since 2006-07 the State has refrained from market borrowings. This has 
had a favourable impact on state finances as the outstanding liability of the State 
dropped from 33.8 per cent of GSDP in March 2008 to 21.1 per cent in March 2012 
which is expected to further go down to 19.6 per cent by March 2013. 
 The reduction in liabilities significantly reduced the debt serving cost, thus 
opening up the space for higher capital outlays and social expenditure. Given the 
7 
 developmental challenge to enhance social and economic infrastructure, it will be 
desirable for the State to step up mobilisation of its own tax revenues to scale up 
capital outlays without resorting to borrowings (Table 3).

Banking Developments 
Let me now turn to development of banking in the State. The formal financial 
system in India is dominated by banks and same is the case with Odisha. The average 
population per bank branch in Odisha declined from 16,800 in March 2003 to 13,800 
in March 2011 which is somewhat comparable to the national average figure of 
13,400 (Chart 8).  During this period the number of branches of commercial bank has 
increased from 2,240 to 3,234.

Apart from the branch network and its population coverage, another major 
indicator of banking development is the credit-deposit (CD) ratio.  In the turn of the 
last decade in 2001, the CD ratio of Odisha at 42 per cent was way below the national 
average of 54 per cent.  As the State experienced rapid economic growth, the CD ratio 
not only accelerated but also exceeded the national average and peaked at 79 per cent 
in 2005-06.  Subsequently the CD ratio moderated, particularly after 2007-08 when 
growth slowed.  As at end-March 2011, Odisha’s CD ratio at 56 per cent remained 
significantly below the national average of 76 per cent (Chart 9).

Another indicator of credit penetration is credit to GSDP ratio.  This ratio for 
Odisha was also relatively low highlighting the scope for further development of

Not only that the C-D ratio has declined, the inter-regional inequality among 
districts in credit deployment has also increased in recent years underscoring the need 
for focused attention to deployment of comparatively less developed districts (Chart

CD Ratio reveals that though the rural population of Odisha is about 83 per cent of the total 
population, the credit flow to the agriculture remained low compared to other sectors.   
Financial Inclusion   
Against this background, let me now turn to the financial inclusion strategy of 
the Reserve Bank and what are the specific steps taken for Odisha? It is important to 
bring the poor and under-privileged sections of the society within the banking fold for 
inclusive growth. In this context, our recent financial inclusion drive has four key 
elements.   
First, provision of a set of basic financial products and services for the 
vulnerable and financially excluded sections.  This includes a savings cum overdraft 
product in the form of no-frills account, and entrepreneurial credit in the form of 
Kisan Credit Card (KCC)/General Credit Card (GCC). 
Second, spread of financial literacy across all sections of the society by 
creating awareness about financial products and services among the population.  
Third, greater regulatory incentives through liberalisation of interest rates and 
branch licensing.  Banks have been given complete freedom to price their advances so 
that lending in the rural areas could be a commercial proposition.  Given the lower 
penetration of formal credit and recourse to money lenders what matters is the 
availability of credit rather than the cost.  Banks have also been given the freedom to 
open branches in centres with population of less than 1,00,000.  
Fourth, use of technology and innovative delivery models so that the cost for 
providing large quantum of small-ticket transactions could be brought down. This 
initiative included putting in place a system of Business Correspondent (BC) Model to 
provide door-step delivery of financial products and services by authorized agents of 
banks; and Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) for routing of payments of the central 
and state government welfare schemes like social security pensions, Mahatma Gandhi

 National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), National Old Age 
Pension Scheme (NOAPS) directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.  
In this direction, the effort so far has been to make basic banking facility 
available to all villages with a population of over 2,000 by end-March 2012. The 
progress in banking coverage over the last two years has indeed been substantial 
(Table 2).  The next step is to provide banking facilities with population below 2000.  
State Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs) are preparing roadmaps for banking 
facilities in these villages in a time bound manner.  For meaningful financial 
inclusion, it is envisaged that banks would set up brick and mortar branches in a 
cluster of 8–10 BC units in a reasonable distance of 3–4 kilometers.

 Financial Inclusion in Odisha 
Let me now highlight the progress in the Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) for 
Odisha. 
First, the banks in Odisha have made provision for banking facilities in 1,877 
unbanked villages having population of more than 2000 by March 2012. Of these, 54 
villages are covered through bricks and mortar branches, 7 villages through ultra small 
branches (USB), 1,740 villages through appointment of BCs and 83 through mobile 
vans. The banks have proposed to open additional 200 brick and mortar branches by 
March 2013. In addition 1,502 villages with population between 1,600 and 2,000 have 
been identified for banking facilities by March 2013. 
Second, by March 2012, over 6 lakh no-frill accounts were opened and 24 
Financial Literacy Counselling Centres (FLCCs) were established.  Third, during 
2011-12, over 10 lakh Kissan Credit Cards (KCCs) were issued. Moreover, over 8,000 
Swarozgar Credit Cards (SCCs) and over 1,000 Artisan Credit Cards (ACCs) were 
issued. Fourth, during 2011-12 over 58,000 self-help groups (SHGs) were credit-
linked. 
Policy Challenges 
Let me now turn to broader macroeconomic policy challenges.  
First, though perceptible structural change in Odisha’s economy is visible, the 
growth has slackened in the recent years. The Odisha economy needs to regain the 
growth momentum so that its per capita income not only converges but also exceeds 
the national average. 
Second, the overwhelming majority of the population is dependent on 
agriculture for livelihood. Yet agricultural production has stagnated. Moreover, the 
agrarian economy remains vulnerable to frequent natural calamities. It is, therefore, 
necessary to make consorted effort to raise productivity in agriculture which is 
13 
 currently low by national standards by stepping up public investment in agriculture 
and encouraging better water-management practices.  
Third, over the medium-term, there is a need to raise the skill levels of rural 
population through greater public investment in health and education so that they may 
find remunerative employment and livelihood opportunities outside the agricultural 
sector. This will encourage greater mechanisation and modern farming practices and 
thus boost agricultural productivity and production. 
Fourth, managing the movement of labour force from agricultural sector to 
industry and services is no less challenging. Given the endowment of mineral 
reserves, the natural tendency will be for extractive industry to develop. However, 
exploitation of natural resources should be conducted in a transparent and 
environmentally sustainable manner with greater emphasis on value addition.  
Fifth, the rich heritage and strategic location of the State provides ample 
opportunities for developing both domestic and international tourism. In this regard, 
upgrading Bhubaneswar airport into an international airport and developing the 
hospitality sector with the active participation of the private sector could boost the 
services sector.  The connectivity can be further improved by developing a few more 
airports in the state. 
Sixth, a few urban centres like Bhubaneswar could be developed into 
knowledge hubs which will not only cater to the skill requirement of the growing state 
economy but also will contribute to the national technical manpower pool.  This will 
also promote growth of skill intensive industries like information technology and 
biotechnology.  
Seventh, the financial sector in the State is dominated by commercial banks.  
Hence, the spread of banking services is important for greater economic activity. In 
this context, the quantitative achievement of banking coverage reflected in increase in 
no-frills accounts need to be converted into meaningful financial inclusion by active 
loan and deposit transactions in these accounts. Given the preponderance of 
agriculture and allied activities and high frequency of natural calamities, group

 lending should be encouraged. In this process, all the stake-holders - banks, the State 
Government and the Reserve Bank - need to work in close co-ordination: banks by 
ensuring that the BCs are active and by gradually increasing the number of brick and 
mortar branches; the State Government by ensuring that social benefit transfers 
progressively take place through bank accounts; and the Reserve Bank by effective 
monitoring and active co-ordination of the financial inclusion action plan in the State.  
Conclusion 
Let me conclude.  Over the last decade Odisha has made rapid economic 
progress starting from a low base.  In this process, while many of the socio-economic 
indicators have improved they still lag behind the national average.  Given the 
resource endowment and strategic location of the State, there is continuing scope for 
stepping up the economic activity which has slackened in the recent years.   This will 
require reorientation of public expenditure towards strengthening social and economic 
infrastructure and active encouragement of private investment in industry and 
services.  In this process, banks can play a major role by effectively meeting the credit 
need of the economy and being more inclusive.  
Thank you.
