? Perspectives on Banking in India   I thank Shri Rajiv Mundhra, President Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC)  and Shri Rajeev Singh, Director General ICC for the opportunity to be a part of  this distinguished panel. The ICC is making an important contribution to the  development of banking by bringing together the experience and expertise from  the banking industry, corporate sector and financial regulators through its banking  summits year after year. In this years Summit too, I see a judicious mix of  expertise from the relevant areas to deliberate on the Indian banking.   The decade of the 2000s was eventful for the Indian economy. We saw  acceleration in GDP growth: with India recording its highest average annual  output growth of 8.7 per cent during the period 2004-08. This was accompanied  by a sharp increase in savings and investment. At the same time, we had to  contend with the fallout of the global financial crisis, the adverse impact of which  has been persisting. Economic growth has slowed down over the last two years  and inflation remained above the tolerable level, though there has been significant  moderation in the first month of the current financial year, 2013-14. These  developments have had an impact on banking.  Against this economic background, I examine the performance of the Indian  banking sector over the last 12 years as finance is inexorably linked with  economic progress. I will then touch upon financial inclusion, with a particular  reference to the eastern-region, as it is a major plank of the Reserve Banks  current policy thrust. I will conclude with some thoughts on challenges for the  banking sector in the way forward.      ? th Speech by Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, delivered at the 5 Indian  Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Banking Summit, at Kolkata on May 18, 2013. The assistance provided by  Rekha Misra and Pallavi Chavan in preparation of the speech is acknowledged.   1 Finance and Growth  Economic literature establishes a positive association between financial  development and growth. In the 1960s and 1970s, the pioneering work by  Raymond Goldsmith, Mckinnon and Shaw underlined the importance of financial  liberalisation to step up savings and investments in an economy, and thereby  1 economic growth. More recent studies, carrying forward the earlier work have  reinforced our understanding of the ways in which finance could exercise a  2 positive influence on economic growth across time and across countries. Even  the recent global financial crisis, the causes of which are complex as they are,  does not negate the view that financial development commensurate with the  3 requirements of the real economy is essential for sustained economic growth .  This is particularly important for a developing economy like ours where the reach  of the formal financial sector is still inadequate.  Let me now turn to banking in  India.  Ours is a bank dominated financial sector: commercial banks account for  over 60 per cent of the total assets of the financial system comprising banks,  insurance companies, non-banking financial companies, cooperatives, mutual  4 funds and other smaller financial entities. Banking expansion as reflected in the  growth of total assets of banks was rapid till the intensification of the global  financial crisis which affected the Indian economy through trade, finance and  confidence channels. Bank assets as a percentage of gross domestic product  (GDP) rose from 60 per cent in 2000-01 to 93 per cent by 2008-09, but there after   1 Mckinnon, R. I.

Bank credit to GDP ratio more than doubled from 24 per cent to  53 per cent during this period but has remained around that level in the following  years (Chart 1).    The growth of the banking sector was influenced by the performance of the  economy, reflected in a co-movement between the growth in banking business  and real GDP growth (Chart 2). It is noteworthy that the period up to 2007-08  was also a period of fiscal consolidation, with combined fiscal deficit of the  centre and the states falling from over 9 per cent of GDP in early 2000s to 4 per  cent by 2007-08 (Chart 3). The consequent reduction in government borrowing  requirement opened up the space for expansion of credit to the commercial sector  in a non-inflationary manner.     3   While the financial expansion has slowed down in the post-crisis period, the  Indian banking sector has shown remarkable resilience and stability. During the  global financial crisis, the timely recourse to counter-cyclical prudential and  monetary policy measures helped the banking sector in transiting through this  challenging period largely unscathed.  Most of the indicators of soundness bear out the stability of the Indian  banking sector. The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) at the aggregate  and bank group-levels have remained above the statutory minimum requirement  of 9 per cent and international norm of minimum 8 per cent since 2001 (Chart 4).     4 There was a steady improvement in the asset quality through the 2000s. For  instance the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as per cent of gross advances  had declined from 12.0 per cent in 2000-01 to 2.4 per cent in 2007-08. Thereafter  it has increased to 3.7 per cent by December 2012, first with higher NPAs in  foreign and private sector banks and more recently in public sector banks      (Chart 5).     While Indian banks compare well with many other advanced and emerging  economies including BRICS in terms of NPA and CRAR, there is considerable  scope for improvement (Table 1).  5     Table 1: Indicators of financial soundness, 2012  Sr.  Country Gross NPAs as % CRAR (%)  No. of gross advances  Select advanced countries      1 Germany 3.0* 17.9  2 Japan 2.4 14.2  3 UK 4.0 15.7  4 USA 3.9 15.3   BRICS      5 Brazil 3.5 16.7  6 Russia 6.0 13.7  7 India  3.6 13.6  8 China 1.0 12.9  9 South Africa 4.0 15.8   EMEs       10 Indonesia  1.8 17.3  11 Korea 1.6 14.1  12 Mexico 2.4 16.0  13 Turkey 2.7 17.9  CRAR: Capital to risk-weighted assets ratio.  *: Data pertains to 2011.

In this regard, the interest rate  structure has been fully deregulated. The statutory pre-emptions of bank  resources through statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and cash reserve ratio (CRR)  have been substantially reduced. Banks access to central bank liquidity through  export credit refinance, marginal standing facility (MSF) and liquidity adjustment  facility (LAF) has been enhanced. Furthermore, branch licensing norms have  been relaxed and prudential norms have been strengthened. In addition, banks  have increasingly adopted technology and accorded greater focus to human  6 resource management. These changes have helped improve efficiency as borne  out by various indicators.   The profitability of the Indian banking sector has been maintained at about  1.0 per cent in terms of Return on Assets (RoA), even in the post-crisis period.  The banks have also shown significant improvement in other efficiency indicators  such as cost to income ratio, business per employee and business per branch.  However, net interest margin (NIM) has gone up indicating deterioration in  allocative efficiency (Table 2).  Let me now turn to financial inclusion with a  particular reference to the eastern-region.

Financial Inclusion   In order to sustain a higher economic growth, it is important to bring the  excluded segment of the society into the fold of the formal financial sector. In  recognition of this, the Reserve Bank has taken a number of steps to take formal  banking to door steps of habitations with population over 2000 through the  business correspondent (BC) model where the BCs provide basic banking  7 functions acting as agents of banks. Simultaneously, a number of initiatives such  as incentivisation of branch authorisation scheme for banks to open branches in  unbanked centres, simplification of Know Your Customer (KYC) norms,  technological interventions and financial literacy-oriented programmes to  increase awareness have been taken. While the initial impact of these initiatives  has been positive, it has created a huge potential for expansion in banking  business once the level of activity is scaled up and government social benefit  transfers increasingly take place through the banking sector.   While we have our own data source to gauge financial inclusion, the Census  of India provides useful information on access to banking.  It shows that about 59  per cent of households had access to banking services in 2011 as compared with  only 35 per cent in 2001. Increase in access for the eastern-region has also gone  up significantly from about 29 per cent in 2001 to 47 per cent in 2011, though the  region still lags behind the all-India average (Table 3).   Table 3: Indicators of banking access  Item All-India Eastern-region   2001 2011 2012 2001 2011 2012  Households availing banking 35.2 58.7 - 28.8 47.3 -  services (in per cent)  Population per bank branch 15.6 13.3 12.5 19.5 18.1 17.3  (000)  No. of accounts per 1000 51 100 106 37 54 54  Population (credit)  No. of accounts per 1000 416 669 734 321 476 540  population (all deposits)  No. of accounts per 1000 272 516 571 202 367 423  population (savings deposits)  Per capita credit outstanding 5.2 33.7 39.1 2.0 12.1 13.9  (Rs. 000)  Per capita total deposits  9.2 44.5 49.4 5.5 22.8 26.5  (Rs. 000)  Source:RBI (for number of deposits accounts, credit accounts, credit outstanding, and deposits  outstanding);   Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India for population and households data.  In 2001, the all-India average population per bank branch was 15,600,  which has fallen steadily to 12,500 by 2012 again suggesting an increased  8 penetration of the branch network. For the eastern-region population per branch  has declined from 19,500 in 2001 to 17,300 in 2012.  While the eastern region has  witnessed an increase in banking outreach since 2001, its average has remained  lower than the all-India average underlining considerable scope for expansion.  Conclusion   Let me conclude with some thoughts on the challenges ahead.  First, weakening asset quality is an immediate concern for the banking  sector. This is more so as the banks credit composition in the recent years has  changed towards longer term assets such as infrastructure and housing. While  improvement in macroeconomic policy environment and expected revival in  economic growth should help mitigate risks to some extent, banks would have to  make concerted efforts to improve asset quality.  Second, while on many efficiency parameters, Indian banks compare  favourably to their global peers, the net interest margin (NIM) remains relatively  high. The banks need to further enhance their productivity so that the  intermediation cost between depositors and borrowers is minimised. This,  coupled with containment of NPAs, will help improve monetary transmission.  Third, as the Indian economy reverts to its high growth path, the demand for  credit will go up. The consequent expansion of the banking sector will require  more capital. Additionally, as the Basel III norms are made applicable, the capital  requirements would increase further. The preliminary assessment by the Reserve  Bank made in June 2012 showed a comfortable position of Indian banks at the  aggregate level to meet the higher capital norms. As per the broad estimates from  the Reserve Bank, public sector banks would require a common equity of Rs1.4- 1.5 trillion in addition to Rs 2.65-2.75 trillion as non-equity capital to meet the  full Basel III norms by 2018. Banks, therefore, need to design appropriate  strategies for meeting these capital norms.   9 Fourth, a key factor that accentuated the global financial crisis was  excessive leverage. While the Indian banking system is currently moderately  leveraged, according to the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank, banks should  strive to maintain a minimum Tier I leverage ratio of 4.5 per cent pending the  final proposal of the Basel Committee. It would be prudent for banks not to dilute  5 their leverage position in the interim period .  Fifth, there are proposals for expansion of the banking sector with new  entrants. The Reserve Bank has already invited applications for new banks.  Further, as indicated in the annual policy statement of May 2013, the Reserve  Bank is preparing a policy discussion paper on banking structure in India which  would be placed in the public domain. The expansion of the banking sector  commensurate with the growth of the economy would not only enhance  competition but also facilitate financial inclusion.  With these remarks, I wish the conference all success.   Thank you.     5 Subbarao D.
