* Banking and Finance in India: Developments, Issues and Prospects     Mr. M.V. Nair, Chairman IBA and Chairman and Managing Director of  Union Bank of India; Mr. Bhaskaran, Chief Executive Officer, Indian Institute of  Banking and Finance; Representatives from EBTN, Distinguished participants  from different parts of the Globe, invited guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:    nd I am delighted to be here amidst all of you at the 62 International  Banking Summer School (IBSS) being organised by the Indian Institute of  Banking and Finance (IIBF) jointly with the Indian Banks' Association (IBA). I am  thankful to the organisers and sponsors for providing me an opportunity to share  my views and interact with you at a forum which I personally rate very high.  Central bankers talk among themselves in various fora, it is high time that the  bankers talk with each other.     The School, open to senior bankers and financial professionals, as we  are aware is a 10 days' brisk academic exercise that provides a platform for the  practitioners of banking and finance to learn and share the latest developments  in the banking and finance field, best practices and products available in today's  fiercely competitive global banking arena. In the present situation of global  turmoil that we have been going through in the last two years, this forum will  provide opportunities to the bankers and finance professionals for understanding  each other better. The exchange of views and the ideas which are going to be  generated here during the next ten days will certainly throw useful insights and  better understanding on how to overcome such problems in future which will be  of great relevance in shaping the banking operations in future. I am saying so, as  I am sure, in times to come, many of you are going to occupy high positions in                                                    *  The Inaugural Address delivered by Dr. K.C.Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of  nd India at the 62 International Banking Summer School (IBSS) jointly organized by the Indian  st Institute of Banking & Finance and Indian Banks Association on August 31 , 2009 at New Delhi.  The Assistance provided by Dr. Deba Prasad Rath and Mr. Sujit K Arvind in preparation of the  address is gratefully acknowledged.   1   banks and Financial Institutions including positions of Chief Executive Officers  (CEOs).  The takeaway from the School is, therefore, of great importance.     2. Considering the theme of IBSS this year and more focus on managing  banks in the era of turbulence, I think it would be appropriate if I share my views  on a topic of contextual relevance, that is, Banking and Finance in India:  Developments, Issues and Prospects in the backdrop of the global financial  crisis.     3.  A recent BIS report has stated that it is useful to think of the financial  system as the economys plumbing. And like the plumbing in a house, the  modern economic system depends on a reliable flow of financing through  intermediaries. Modern life requires the smooth operation of banks, insurance  companies, securities firms, mutual funds, finance companies, pension funds and  governments. These institutions channel resources from those who save to those  who invest, and they are supposed to transfer risk from those who cant afford it  to those who are willing and able to bear it (BIS, 2009). In India too, we have a  well-diversified financial system which is still dominated by bank intermediation,  though the size of the capital market has expanded significantly with financial  liberalization in the early 1990s. Important components of the financial sector in  India broadly fall into categories namely; commercial banks, urban co-operative  banks (UCBs), rural financial institutions, non-banking financial companies  (NBFCs), housing finance companies (HFCs), financial institutions (FIs), mutual  funds and the insurance sector. Commercial banks together with co-operative  banks account for nearly 70 per cent of the total assets of Indian financial  institutions.      Global Banking Trends and the Crisis     4. Before I dwell on the developments in the Indian banking and financial  arena let me first touch upon briefly the global banking trends in view of the  2   present crisis.  The current global crisis, as is well known by now, has its genesis  in the imprudent practices of banks and non-bank institutions worldwide,  especially in the US. The fact that more than 80 banks have failed in the US  alone is a pointer to how deep and widespread the malaise was. Looking at the  past few years, it may be useful to divide the causes of the current crisis into two  broad categories: macroeconomic and microeconomic. The macro-economic  causes fall into two groups: problems associated with the build-up of imbalances  in international claims and difficulties created by the long period of low real  interest rates. The microeconomic causes fall into three areas: incentives, risk  measurement and regulation (BIS, 2009).    5. The crisis is best regarded as the steep downside of an extraordinary  global financial cycle that was amplified by structural weaknesses. The financial  imbalances that had built up slowly but inexorably during the boom, on the back  of aggressive risk-taking and leveraging, had finally started to unwind.  As  elaborated in the BIS Annual Report (2009), financial cycles are exacerbated by  inherent difficulties in measuring risk and by distortions in incentives. Episodic  financial strains cannot be eradicated entirely; the market is not fully self- correcting. But they can be mitigated or magnified by policy.    6. The crisis events can be traced to evidence of serious trouble emerging  from when banks became less willing to lend to each other, because they were  no longer sure how to value the assets held and the promises made  both their  own and those of potential borrowers. For a time, central bank lending was able  to fill the gap. But from August 2007 the stress in the financial system increased  in waves. By March 2008, we are all aware, the crisis deepened and Bear  Stearns had to be rescued from failure; six months later, on September 15,  Lehman Brothers went bankrupt; and by the end of September, 2008 the global  financial system itself was on the verge of collapse.       3   Global Crisis: US, Europe and Emerging Market Economies    7. In the United States, the crisis was shaped by particular characteristics of  the US financial system such as a complex mortgage financing value chain with  opaque securitization structures, a large shadow financial system involving  various poorly regulated intermediaries (investment banks, hedge funds,  structured investment vehiclesSIVs) and instruments (credit default swaps),  the important role played by government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac), as well as a fragmented supervisory architecture.     8. The US financial system is in many aspects unique due to the high share  of capital market intermediaries and instruments. Deposit money banks  account  for a relatively low share of financial system assets; the stocks of market  instruments are significantly larger (including private bonds), and the ratio of  claims on the private sector to deposits is much higher. Overall, these indicators  reflect the much greater role played by large investment banks, institutional  investors, and other financial institutions, as well the extensive use of  securitization.     9. While financial institutions in the US are at the heart of the problem,  European banks face similar problems which shows how deeply interconnected  national financial systems have become. European banks have been hit nearly  as strongly as their American peers by losses from subprime mortgage  investments, leveraged loans, failed financial hedges and a surge in conventional  credit losses. As per one study of June 2009, banks on both sides of the Atlantic  had to cope with combined write-downs of more than USD 1 trillion in this crisis   and they may have to take USD 1.3 trillion more. Governments around the globe  have had to intervene to prevent a wholesale collapse of the financial system.  They have injected more than USD 200 billion in fresh capital into the top 20  banks alone; besides there are much larger asset and debt guarantees.    4   10. Emerging countries have not developed the same complex financing  structures as those in the US, but several countries have already suffered from  severe external imbalances, caused by fiscal imbalances and/ or over-extended  banking systems. These countries have become particularly vulnerable, as the  crisis is transmitted through financial and trade channels. However, the specific  channels of transmission may differ significantly across countries. The basic  structure of the financial system is, however, not expected to change  significantly, as banks still play a dominant role and capital markets are generally  less developed.    11. Hard-hit by the global financial crisis, the worldwide banking industry's  future development has now been sharply drawn into focus.  Bankers and  government officials will have to grapple with important issues such as the best  corporate governance model for the future of an industry in which a number of  banks have benefitted from government bailouts.  Equally important concerns  such as the return of morality to the market, the definition of financial risk and the  tradeoff among innovation, self-discipline and regulation require the banking  industry to think outside the box.  It has changed the face of Wall Street with lots  of investment banks changing their business models.  What will the future holds  for these financial institutions is a subject being widely debated internationally to  probe the future of the banking industry world over.  I am sure this school will  devote some time for such discussions.     Role of Banking / Financial system in Economy    12. In the analytical and empirical literature on the subject of finance and  growth, there is a consensus among economists that development of the  financial system contributes to economic growth (Rajan and Zingales, 2003).  Financial development creates enabling conditions for growth through either a  supply-leading (financial development spurs growth) or a demand-following  (growth generates demand for financial products) channel. Empirical evidence  5   consistently emphasises the nexus between finance and growth, though the  issue of direction of causality is more difficult to determine. At the cross-country  level, evidence indicates that various measures of financial development  (including assets of the financial intermediaries, liquid liabilities of financial  institutions, domestic credit to private sector, stock and bond market  capitalisation) are robustly and positively related to economic growth (King and  Levine, 1993; Levine and Zervos, 1998).     Financial Deepening in India    13. In the Indian case, healthy growth of the assets of commercial banks in  the recent period, driven primarily by credit growth and sharp rise in credit-GDP,  deposit-GDP and M3-GDP ratios are reflective of significant financial deepening  in India. For example, during the period since 1980s, while bank assets-GDP  ratio has tripled moving up from 31.4 per cent in the 1980s to 93.3 per cent in  2008-09, credit-GDP ratio has increased from 19.3 per cent to 52.2 per cent,  deposits-GDP ratio has increased from 29.8 per cent to 72.0 per cent and M3- GDP ratio has increased from 39.0 per cent to 89.5 per cent (Statistical Annex  SA 1).    14. In a cross-country perspective, when measured by the ratio of bank assets  to GDP, financial depth in India was among the lowest in the world (Barth, Caprio  and Levine, 2001). Comparable cross-country data indicated that in 2001, this  ratio, at 48 per cent for India, was lower than those prevalent in Asian economies  such as Indonesia (101 per cent), Korea (98 per cent), Philippines (91 per cent),  Malaysia (166 per cent) and much lower than developed economies, such as UK  (311 per cent), France (147 per cent) and Germany (313 per cent). In India, while  the ratio of bank assets to GDP has increased significantly to a shade over 93  per cent in 2008-09  a result of high credit growth in recent years - it is still lower  than other emerging countries. Financial deepening, hence, has been taking  6   place on an accelerated pace on a macro basis in recent years and banking  productivity has improved significantly.     15. As per the data from Indias national accounts, over the period since  1980s, banking and insurance sector has witnessed a growth which is in excess  of the overall GDP consistently over the years. In the 1980s, the growth of  banking and insurance sector was 10.6 per cent vis--vis the GDP growth of 5.6  per cent - this increased to 15.4 per cent in 2007-08 vis--vis the GDP growth of  9.0 per cent (Statistical Annex SA 2).     16. Another noteworthy feature discernible in Indian context is that the rise in  indicators of financial deepening takes place along with a noticeable rise in the  domestic savings rate. The rate of domestic savings has specially picked up in  the recent period during 2003-04 to 2007-08 against the backdrop of financial  sectors reforms, rise in total factor productivity and investment boom, which had  led to acceleration in the growth performance, while in the developed countries  like the US and Japan the rise in financial deepening has had a limited effect on  the savings rates of the economies.  The results may seem contrasting; however,  the country specific reason such as the level of social security measures on  welfare of people, wealth effect in the period of rising assets prices and most  significantly the demographic profile which explain the Life Cycle Hypothesis  (LCH) may have dampened the savings propensity in a country.    17. A  cautionary remark, however, I would like to make here. In the context of  the macro-economic trend of high services sector growth which includes the  banking sector growth, I feel that the services growth needs to be well supported  by growth from the real sectors of the economy. Financial leverage cannot bring  perpetual prosperity. Banks need to keep this in mind, and I am telling this as a  banker, as well as a central banker.      7   Indian Banking Trends      18. As you are aware, there is significant transformation of the Indian banking  sector. The financial sector reforms in the country were initiated in the beginning  of the 1990s. The reforms have brought about a sea change in the profile of the  banking sector. Our implementation of the reforms process has had several  unique features. Our financial sector reforms were undertaken early in the reform  cycle. Notably, the reforms process was not driven by any banking crisis, nor was  it the outcome of any external support package. Besides, the design of the  reforms was crafted through domestic expertise, taking on board the international  experiences in this respect. The reforms were carefully sequenced with respect  to the instruments to be used and the objectives to be achieved. Thus, prudential  norms and supervisory strengthening were introduced early in the reform cycle,  followed by interest-rate deregulation and a gradual lowering of statutory pre- emptions. The more complex aspects of legal and accounting measures were  ushered in subsequently when the basic tenets of the reforms were already in  place.    19. Though public sector banks (PSBs) account for around 70 per cent of  commercial banking assets and 72.7 per cent of the aggregate advances of the  Scheduled commercial banking system (as on March 31, 2008), competition in  the banking sector has increased in recent years with the emergence of private  players as also with greater private shareholding of PSBs. Listing of PSBs on  stock exchanges and increased private shareholding have also added to  competition. The new private banks which accounted for 2.6 per cent of the  commercial banking sector in March 1997 have developed rapidly and accounted  for nearly 17 per cent of the commercial banking assets by end March 2008.           8   Financial Health of the Banking System    20. The implementation of reforms has had an all-round salutary impact on  the financial health of the banking system, as evidenced by the significant  improvements in a number of prudential parameters. Let me briefly highlight the  improvements in a few salient financial indicators of the banking system  (Statistical annex SA 3 & 4). The average capital adequacy ratio for the  scheduled commercial banks, which was around 10.4 per cent in 1997, had  increased to 13.08 per cent as on March 31, 2008. In regard to the asset quality  also, the gross NPAs of the scheduled commercial banks, which were as high as  15.7 per cent at end-March 1997, declined significantly to 2.3 per cent as at end- March 2008. The net NPAs of these banks during the same period declined from  8.1 per cent to 1.08 per cent. The reform measures have also resulted in an  improvement in the profitability of banks. The Return on Assets (RoA) of  scheduled commercial banks increased from 0.4 per cent in the year 1991-92 to  0.99 per cent in 2007-08. The Indian banks are well placed in this regard too vis- -vis the broad range of RoA for the international banks. The banking sector  reforms also emphasised the need to improve productivity of the banks through  appropriate rationalisation measures so as to reduce the operating cost and  improve the profitability. A variety of initiatives were taken by the banks, including  adoption of modern technology, which has resulted in improved productivity.     21. One area that needs to be watched continuously due to recent crisis is the  off-balance sheet (OBS) exposure of the banks. The spurt in OBS exposure is  mainly on account of derivatives whose share averaged around 80 per cent. The  derivatives portfolio has also undergone change with single currency Interest  Rate Swaps (IRS) comprising 57 per cent of total portfolio at end- March 2008  from less than 15 per cent at end-March 2002.     9   22. With regard to the assessment of the banking system in India we appear  to be in a comfortable position, as confirmed by the Committee on Financial  Sector Assessment (CFSA):    (i) Commercial banks have shown a healthy growth rate and an improvement  in performance as is evident from capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings  and efficiency indicators. In spite of some reversals during the financial year  2008-09, the key financial indicators of the banking system do not throw up  any major concern or vulnerability and the system remains resilient; and   (ii) The single-factor stress tests carried for the commercial banking sector  covering credit risk, market / interest rate risk and liquidity risk have revealed  that the banking system can withstand significant shocks arising from large  potential changes in credit quality, and liquidity conditions.     Lessons from India    23. The fact that India has not gone through any financial crisis as a result of  financial deregulation is not only remarkable, but a testimony to the correctness  reforms to global standards need to be adjusted to local  of the judgment that  conditions (Mohan, 2007). The need of the hour is to have financial sector  reforms in a recalibrated manner to address the issues in light of the crisis. India  has so far remained relatively insulated from the crisis that global banking system  has experienced in the course of the 1990s. Our exposure to troubled sub-prime  assets and related derivatives is negligible in comparison to many other  economies. The fact that, so far financial sector reforms have been calibrated  with a progressive integration into the world economy has paid us rich dividends.  A key consideration in the choice of pace and sequencing has been the  management of volatility in financial markets and implications for the conduct of  monetary operations. The nuanced approach to financial sector reform has  served us well with an accent on conscious gradualism in the implementation of  coordinated and sequenced moves on several fronts. What have been ensured  are appropriate safeguards to ensure stability, while taking account of the  10   prevailing governance standards, risk management systems and incentive  frameworks in financial institutions in the country. Overall, these progressive but  cautious policies have contributed to efficiency of the financial system while  sustaining the growth momentum in an environment of macroeconomic and  financial stability. The policy challenge is, to continue to ensure financial stability  in India during this period of international financial turbulence, while achieving  high growth with price stability.    24. Some of the reasons for Indias insulation as highlighted by Dr. Y.V.  Reddy, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India are: (1) The nascent  stage of development of the credit derivatives market; (2) Regulatory guidelines  on securitisation do not permit immediate profit recognition; (3) Perseverance of  prudential policies which prevent institutions from excessive risk taking and  financial markets from becoming extremely volatile and turbulent; and (4) Close  co-ordination between supervision of banks and their regulation.    Future Challenges to Banking from the Regulatory Perspective    25. I would like to bring to the fore four issues that I consider very important  for the future regulatory reform process not only in Indian context but in the  context of many emerging markets as we move ahead. First is the issue related  to Know Your Customer (KYC) in banks; Second, from a central bankers  perspective whether the banks are according Fair Treatment to their Customers  (FTC) ; Third, is the issue of Risk Management and its proper understanding  and Fourth is the Leveraging Technology for greater Financial Inclusion. Let us  discuss these four important issues in some detail now.      Know Your Customer (KYC) in all its Manifestations    26. First is the issue of KYC in banks and its importance in the overall  enhancement in the functioning of the banks. Sound KYC policies and  11   procedures not only contribute to a bank's overall safety and soundness, they  also protect the integrity of the banking system by reducing the likelihood of  banks becoming vehicles for money laundering, terrorist financing and other  unlawful activities. There are three components here. Knowing their customers  is not enough for banks, they should also know the business of their customers;  (KYBC) and if the banks know the business of their customers, the banks must  understand and assess the risks associated with each of their customers  businesses (KYCBR). The banks should realize that these parts of Know Your  Customer in all their manifestations, viz. Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your  Customers Business (KYCB) and Know Your Customers Business Risk    (KYCBR) is not only an integral part of elementary Risk Management Process  but it also makes a good business sense.  Regulatory intervention in this area is  going to increase in future.     Fair Treatment to Customers (FTC)    27. Second issue is with regard to affording Fair Treatment to Customers  (FTC) by banks. This requirement is key to the operation of an efficient retail  market for financial services. FTC is also central to consumers having confidence  in the financial services industry. This principle must be adopted and supported  by the leadership of financial firms, and embedded throughout a firms operations  and within its culture. Another important aspect related to FTC is from the  Regulators perspective. One may ask why the regulator should at all be  concerned about customers not being treated fairly by banks. In this connection,  it is important to note that not all financial entities are accorded the status of the  Banks. The banks raise deposits many times more than the capital resources  they have and hence they have a special responsibility to customers for providing  fair treatment. Banks need to respond to the challenge of restoring consumer  confidence in the financial services industry and ensuring that they treat their  customers fairly.    12   28. In addition, in a competitive marketplace, FTC should be an important  element (alongside service levels, pricing and customer satisfaction) in  determining the success of a bank in acquiring and maintaining market share.  However, in many markets for retail financial products and services the incentive  structure for firms to treat their customers fairly has not always been robust  enough to deter all firms from inadvertently or deliberately taking advantage of  the relative weakness of the financial services consumer.     29. There should be a blend of regulatory and market-based solutions to  delivering fairness to customers. The key issue is the balance between these  two. The issue of addressing the fair treatment of customers throughout the  product life-cycle comprises:   Product design and governance;   Identifying target markets;   Marketing and promoting the product;   Sales and advice processes;   After-sales information; and   Complaint handling.    These issues will create challenges for banks. They may have to adapt  the management, reward and operating systems they currently use and enhance  the controls they have in place to monitor whether they are meeting the FTC  requirement.     30. Thus, there is a need to develop a better, and common, understanding of  what FTC means in practice. Banks need to examine what most effectively  constitutes fair treatment of customers. Banks senior management needs to  assess their current performance against the requirement to treat customers  fairly, identify possible areas for improvement and ensure that the principle of  fairness is embedded in their work-culture.    13   Risk Management    31. The Third issue which has assumed critical significance now is Risk  Management and its proper understanding. We cannot view banks risks at  individual level in isolation all the time. It has also been argued that the emphasis  on micro-prudential regulation may have contributed to the buildup of some  macro risks. Collectively, the systemic risk is becoming more and more  prominent with the increasing complexities and the associated risk factors in the  banking activities. The banks have to have a proper understanding of all the risk  factors and at the same time they have to ensure that their customers also  understand and appreciate the associated risk. In the event of such banking  activities leading to the emergence of systemic risks, the central bank may  intervene which might result in stricter regulation and supervision.      32. The most critical issue is of liquidity risk management in the banks in the  wake of the crisis. We may have a situation where the liquidity may dry up and  the banks and the financial institutions would face severe liquidity crunch due to  adverse market conditions. In this scenario, the liquidity crunch might completely  wipe out the capital of the bank as well leading to its failure. Another case might  be a scenario where plenty of liquidity in the market may fuel inflation. Therefore,  we have to be vigilant and monitor the market conditions more vigorously.     33. In recent times increase in the banks dependence on bulk deposits to  fund credit growth has assumed significance as this could have liquidity and  profitability implications. An increase in growth in housing loans, real estate  exposure as also infrastructure has resulted in elongation of the maturity profile  of bank assets.  There is growing dependence on purchased liquidity and also an  increase in the illiquid component in banks balance sheets with greater reliance  on volatile liabilities, like bulk deposits to fund asset growth. Simultaneously,  there has been a shortening of residual maturities, leading to a higher asset- liability mismatch. There is a need to strengthen liquidity management in this  14   context as also to shore up the core deposit base and to keep an adequate  cushion of liquid assets to meet unforeseen contingencies. What needs to be  borne in mind is that while at an individual customer level, retail deposits may be  volatile, but for the bank and the banking system as a collective lot, it provides  solid foundation for the banks to fund their long term assets like infrastructure  and similar business activities. How do we cultivate this aspect in our business  model and Risk Management Process is a great challenge.     Inclusive Growth: Financial Inclusion through Leveraging Technology    34. Coming to Fourth issue, let me remind that, in the history of human  civilization it has always been the technology which has led to mass availability of  products and services. Same is the case for banking services. We are in the  midst of the most exciting period of human civilization when two billion of  population is expected to move up from below poverty line to above poverty line  (BPL). Majority of these will be in this sub-continent and banks will have an  opportunity to participate in this process, which will bring sustainable peace and  prosperity to the mankind.     35. For achieving the goal of Financial Inclusion, experts have recommended  the Business Correspondent / Facilitator (BC/BF) model. However, some recent  studies have pointed out that the BC model at the initial stage, may not be  commercially viable due to a high transaction cost for the banks and customers.  Here, the appropriate use of technology can help in reducing the transaction  cost. The need of the hour is to develop and implement scalable platform  independent technology solutions which, if implemented on a larger scale, will  bring down the high cost of operation. Technology, thus, really holds the key for  financial inclusion to take place on an accelerated scale.     36. The need of the hour is leveraging technology in Indian banking for  providing affordable and cost-effective banking services to the masses through  15   multi-delivery channels. All of us know that apart from traditional business, banks  now-a-days provide a wide range of services to satisfy the financial and non- financial needs of all types of customers from the smallest account holder to the  largest company and in some cases of non customers. The range of services  offered differs from bank to bank depending mainly on the type and size of the  bank. The key enabling factor has been the adoption of technology. Banking  industry is fast growing with the use of technology in the form of ATMs, on-line  banking, Telephone banking, Mobile banking etc., plastic card is one of the  banking products that cater to the needs of retail segment has seen its number  grow in geometric progression in recent years. The internet banking is changing  the banking industry and is having the major effects on banking relationship.  Retail banking in India is maturing with time; several products, which further  could be customized are in the retails segments of housing loan, personal loan,  education loan, vehicle loan, etc.    37. Being convinced that technology is the key for improving in productivity,  the Reserve Bank took several initiatives to popularize usage of technology by  banks in India. Periodically, almost once in five years since the early 1980s, the  Reserve Bank appointed Committees and Working Groups to deliberate on and  recommend the appropriate use of technology by banks given the circumstances  and the need.     38. Even as global financials face growth and asset-quality issues, Indian  banks continue to offer a healthy growth trajectory with minimal balance-sheet  risks.  Despite the high growth rate of the past decade, penetration for most  financial products/services in India remains low. Indian banks can sustain their  structural high growth trajectory, driven by an under-penetrated financial-services  sector, a conducive economic environment and a supportive regulatory regime.   Financial penetration holds the key to financial inclusion and inclusive growth.  Favorable demographics would be a facilitating factor. Way forward, financial  16   penetration is expected to rise as banks expand into new areas, focus on  building their retail business and strengthen their risk-management system.      Conclusion    39. To sum up, while global banking developments have offered innumerable  perspectives, important perceptions are emerging from the Indian banking  developments. Given the long term objective of achieving 9.0 per cent of GDP  growth, we need to understand that there are significant challenges for Indian  banking. Of these, the major challenge would be to achieve financial inclusion  through improved financial penetration in hitherto uncovered areas, which in turn  would enable inclusive and sustainable growth for the economy. We all have to  put our minds together and continually strive towards achieving this in the days  ahead.    40. The question currently on top of the minds of most bankers present here  would be: what will be the shape of banking in days to come? Will banks do  business differently? What are the changes that are likely to take place? The  answer to these questions may come out from some serious deliberations in the  next few days and before arriving at any conclusion in this regard, we certainly  have to explore many options. The only thing that can be said at this juncture is  that regulation may become tighter and supervision more controlled. Other than  that, it is difficult to say whether there will be any fundamental change in the way  banks work.   I am sure that the discussions, case studies, panel discussions, CEO  Round Table planned during the IBSS sessions, which have been woven around  topics of contemporary relevance like, understanding the reasons for the global  financial system melt down; changing contours of risk; understanding the role of  IT and Risk Management system and discussion on arriving at coping strategies;  new frontiers of banking; emergence of Inclusive banking, etc. will bring out  some useful insights and out of box creative and innovative ideas from the  17   market players to deal with the present complex situation. This will also help in  creating an enabling environment for an overall balanced economic growth of the  world economy.      I wish you all the best and the 62nd IBSS deliberations a grand success.     Thank you.            18   Select Reference    th Bank for International Settlements (2009), 79 Annual Report, 1 April 2008 to 31  March 2009.    Barth, J., G. Caprio and R.
