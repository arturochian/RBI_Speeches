Financial Stability: Indian Experience          I am thankful to the BIS for inviting me to share some thoughts on financial stability issuesin the Panel of four Governors. It is an honour to address the galaxy of central bankersassembled here in connection with the annual meetings of the BIS. My observations are basedon the Indian experience and would focus on rebalancing of efficiency and stability in the contextof financial sector reforms in India.2.    In India, we have been moving from a government-dominated financial system to a marketoriented one. In the past, the Government domination was, in a sense, imparting too muchstability through rigidity and too little efficiency. In this context, enhancing efficiency while at thesame time, avoiding instability in the system, has been the challenge for the regulators in India.3.    The concept of financial stability needs to be understood contextually also. For us in India, itmeans: (a) ensuring uninterrupted financial transactions; (b) maintenance of a level of confidencein the financial system amongst all the participants and stakeholders; and (c) absence of excessvolatility that unduly and adversely affects real economic activity. Such financial stability has to beparticularly ensured when the financial system is undergoing structural changes to promoteefficiency. The structural changes relate to ownership, regulation and competition, both, domesticas well as external competition. Integration of financial markets is another dimension of theprocess: the integration of domestic financial markets is one aspect while global financialintegration is another though a related aspect.4.    While global financial integration does have beneficial impact, the volatility in capital flowscan cause instability, specially if a country has not reached the "threshold", as very ably explainedby Professor Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University. Many emerging market economies do notseem to have adequate self-correcting market mechanisms in respect of such cross-bordercapital flows. In such cases, the capital flows at critical times reflect more of changes in the riskappetite of the international investors than a country's fundamentals. Hence, special defencesneed to be put in place for ensuring financial stability in the case of countries like India that arefaced with the prospect of volatile capital flows. The issues relating to cross-border supervision offinancial intermediaries in the context of greater capital flows are just emerging and these need tobe addressed.5.    In the context of ongoing reforms in the financial sector in India, the regulatory regime hasalso undergone certain fundamental changes. New regulators like those for the insurance sectorand capital markets have been created. The focus of regulation has also changed. The issues ofregulatory co-ordination do arise often. However, the changes in the regulatory regime, meant forgreater efficiency, may, on occasion, contain the risk of being a source of instability.1 Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India spoke on financial stability issues atthe Zurich University, Zurich, Switzerland on June 27, 20046.    This leads us to the role of regulators in developing market-oriented financial system whilemaintaining the independence and credibility of the regulator. In India, this process involveddevelopment of technological and institutional infrastructure by the Reserve Bank of India,changing the interface with the market participants through consultations and communication -which was critical for mutual benefit. The relationship with the Government - as the majorityowner of the financial entities, as the ultimate risk-bearer in the system and as the sovereign inlaw making - is also changing in the new environment.7.    In a way, in the development of a market-oriented financial system, the Reserve Bank of                                                India is, what I may call, a "nurturing'' regulator as well as an "independent" regulator. In therelationship with the government, the Reserve Bank of India emphasises: (a) autonomy inoperations; (b) harmony with the government policies, specially due to the continuing denselinkage between fiscal and financial sectors in India; and (c) co-ordination with the government inbringing about structural changes, particularly in respect of public ownership and legislativeframework.8.    In this background, would a single regulator, other than the central bank help? Willseparating banking supervision from the central bank be of help? I would like to quote hereProfessor Charles Goodhart (2000):"I doubt whether the pressures to establish a unifiedsupervisory agency are quite as strong in most developing countries." He adds: " For suchreasons, I do not believe that the case for separation, which has become stronger in thedeveloped countries, should be transposed also to the developing countries. " I hope the views ofProfessor Goodhart in this regard, since he made the above comments at a memorial lecture inRBI, have not changed over the past three-four years. As a pragmatic measure, we have bankingsupervision under an independent Board for Financial Supervision (but within the RBI) whilesome sort of co-ordination is sought to be achieved through a High Level Co-ordinationCommittee on Financial and Capital Markets, consisting of financial regulators and the Ministry ofFinance, but presided over by the Governor, RBI.9.    In conclusion, I would like to highlight three aspects of financial stability. First, we keep inmind our vulnerability to real sector shocks which would affect financial stability. The majorsources of such shocks in India are very sharp rise in oil prices and extraordinary monsoonfailures. Second, we have political system stability in India though there have been coalitiongovernments at the federal level. We are aware that most of the currency crises in developingcountries occurred around the times of political elections, particularly in countries with thepresidential form of government. Our experience in India is that political cycles have had arelatively muted impact on financial stability.  In any case, socio-political preference for greaterfinancial stability needs to be appreciated and the weight accorded to financial stability in Indiaappears to be higher than in some other countries. Third, developing countries differ so much insize, nature and structure of the economy, level of development and socio-political conditions thatmy observations here are more of random thoughts to be mulled over rather than structuredissues in respect of financial stability in developing countries.Thank you.2
