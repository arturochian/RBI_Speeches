Inaugural Address at theNew Delhi, February 24, 1999byShri S P Talwar,as International law enforcement agencies who have gathered here at the National Seminar onThe economic loss caused internationally by this type of crime is estimated to run into largesums. Although this is not the scenario in India at present, this is potentially a high risk areawhich we have to address with care and in a timely manner. The vulnerability of computersystems which support critical applications, whether in the area of defence or finance, makes itimperative that we acquaint ourselves with the means to prevent and combat this menace. Sincebanks would be one of the major targets of computer crime, it is necessary for us to have an ideaof not only of the level of computerisation in the banking industry in India but also of theBefore we take up the various issues relating to computer related crime, let me give a briefOne of the characteristic features of computer crime is its transnational character. Computercrimes often extend across national borders thanks to the technological growth in the industrythat has made geographical borders insignificant. Remote access facilities have necessitated theharmonization of domestic laws and regulations in tandem with global prosecution needs.Broadly, computer crimes are those that are committed either on a computer system or with theaid of such a system. A distinction is sometimes made between 'computer fraud', where the fraudinvolves the manipulation of computers, and 'computer crime' where a computer is used tocommit a fraud. Since this seminar is concerned with ‘Computer Related Crime’, both types ofHowever, it is important not to lose sight of types of crimes that are often committed. The United1Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer Related Crime classifies suchThe first and most important type of this is the committing of a fraud by manipulation of theinput, output, or throughput  of a computer based system. This is of especial interest to the RBIInput manipulation is the most common type and results in the changing of input data such asdeposit amounts in ledgers, limits in accounts, or face values of cheques. Output manipulation isachieved by affecting the output of the system such as the one entailing the use of stolen orThe most well known throughput manipulation technique involves the process of rounding off ofthe sums being credited to different accounts and siphoning of the rounded off digits to another                                            Can be accessed at http://www.ifs.univie.ac.at1falsified cards in ATM machines.which has been entrusted with the task of supervision of banks and financial institutions.crimes into five categories.Types of Computer Crimescrimes would be the focus of attention of the participants of this seminar.However, the precise definition of computer crime itself may vary from country to country.What is Computer Crime?overview on computer crime.mechanisms that have been set in place to address the problems that would endanger the systems.Computer Related Crime to interact on the threats posed by risks in computerised environment.It gives me great pleasure to be amidst the representatives of the financial sector, National as wellLadies and Gentlemen,Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of IndiaNational Seminar on Computer Related Crime,account.

This is partly due to the fact that detection of suchcrime is often difficult and requires a high level of skills, and partly due to the fact thatorganisations often do not report these crimes for fear of adverse publicity on their systems andcontrols. One estimate made in 1992 suggested that only 5 per cent of the losses caused by3computer crimes were actually reported. This is a matter of great concern for all of us becausethis would imply that the magnitude of the problem could well turn out to be far greater thanwhat is widely known to be the factual position and therefore requires greater resources for bothdetection and prevention than the existing available levels. At the same time, it is necessary notStatus of Computerisation of Banks in IndiaThe first initiatives in the area of bank computerisation stemmed out of the landmark report ofthe two committees headed by the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and currentlyGovernor of Andhra Pradesh, His Excellency, Dr.C.Rangarajan. One of these Committees, viz.the Committee on the Mechanization of the Banking Industry (1984) was set up for the firsttime to suggest a model for mechanisation of bank branches, regional / controlling offices andHead Office. This had been necessitated by the explosive growth in the geographical spread ofIn the ‘seventies, there was a four-fold increase in the number of branches, five-fold increase inadvances and a six-fold increase in deposits’. Mechanisation was seen as the best solution to the“problems inherent in the manual system of operations, their adverse impact on customerservices and the grave dangers to banks in the context of increasing incidence of frauds." Basedon a study of transaction volumes and purposes, the Committee made detailed recommendationsIn the first phase of computerisation spanning the five years ending 1989, banks in India hadinstalled 4776 ALPMs at the branch level, 233 minicomputers at the Regional/Controlling officelevels and trained over 2000 programmers/systems personnel and over 12000 Data EntryTerminal Operators. The Reserve Bank too had embarked upon an ambitious program to bring                                             AIDP report on computer crime released at  Colloquium on Computer Crimes and Other Crimes against2Information Technology, held in Germany in October 1992.3 Quoted in Reuvid, ibid.2on the model of mechanisation.banking following nationalization of banks in 1969.Let me now present the current status of computerisation of banks in India.to create a scare about its extent in the absence of hard and verifiable evidence.Computer crime can often turn out to be a 'dark' crime because of the lack of information that lawthe affected organisations.sums of money across countries or enter and destroy valuable data and cause very high damage toCharacteristics of Computer Crimeunauthorized reproduction of computer programs or software piracy.unauthorized access to computers by 'hacking' into systems or stealing passwords, and,computer forgery, which involves changing images or data stored in computers,Among the other types of computer crimes, the major ones  are:automated and secure fund transfer systems such as the CHIPS of USA and CHAPS of UK.Inaugural Address at theNational Seminar on Computer Related Crimeabout state-of-the-art technology in the clearing process and had introduced MICR clearing at 44Against this backdrop, the Committee on Computerisation in Banks was set up once againunder Dr.Rangarajan's Chairmanship to draw up a perspective plan for computerisation in banks.In its report submitted in 1989, the Committee acknowledged the gains of the initial efforts andenvironment in branch banking. It recommended that the thrust of bank computerisation for thefollowing 5 years should be to fully computerise the operations at both the front and back officesComputerisation efforts among the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in India, which account for over80 per cent of the assets of the entire banking system, has been substantial. Of the 45,439branches of the PSBs as on September 30, 1998, as many as 3,668 branches serving customersdirectly had been fully computerised with a complement of more than 65,000 computernodes/PCs. A total of 6961 branches have been partially computerised – with Advanced LedgerPosting Machines, Electronic Accounting Machines and Personal Computers. Of the 336 serviceThe PSBs had installed 194 Automated Teller machines (ATMs) all over the country; they hadissued over 8.5 lakh credit cards and  over 32,000 debit cards. The latest in this area of activityFor international interconnectivity of computers and for cross-border transactions, 568 brancheshave been connected to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication(popularly known as S.W.I.F.T).

The payment systems which constitute thearteries of any economy has been recognised as  the focus area for this group. This group wouldconsolidate the existing payment systems, developing new, technologically advanced modes ofTo facilitate these objectives, a Computer based network has also been established. This WideArea Satellite Based network, called the In dian nancial work (INFINET) aims atconnecting computers at branches of banks. 479 branches at commercially important cities are tobe connected to the INFINET in the first phase while the next phase would witness the coverageThe INFINET is a robust and secure network which would be used for effecting financial fundsmovements and important information flow within the country.

The INFINET User Group is engaged in  various aspects pertaining to thePayment Systems in the country including the issues related to security over the network,encryption and decryption of messages during transmission, standardisation of message formats,The Reserve Bank continues to be involved in shaping the technology vision of the bankingsystem. Following the recommendations of the Committee on Financial Sector Reforms(which is popularly known as the second Narasimham committee), a Committee on TechnologyUpgradation has been recently set up by the RBI for the Banking Sector. This committee hasrepresentation from banks, Government, technical institutions and the RBI.

Computer crime, however,  is not because of illegal work of insiders alone, it hasoften been the handiwork of a wider spectrum of societies. School students have been known tohave broken into high security systems just for pleasure. Terrorist groups and organised crimegangs have been known to attempt to sabotage critical systems to cripple economies or targetlarge financial institutions to fund their activities. In 1993, a systems analyst in a leading UKfinancial institution was convicted of attempting to  transfer 1.6 million pounds to criminally5Disgruntled employees target company systems to take revenge on their employers whileThis diversity, along with the anonymity of the perpetrator who can commit such crimes fromremote locations,  makes the task of having profiles of  criminals difficult and poses a challengeIn this context, I would like to recall an incident reported by a multinational bank a couple ofyears back. In the reported instance, an IT expert could penetrate the multilayer password systemgoverning the fund transfer facility of the bank, which was allowed to be self operated by itscorporate customers. He could successfully  effect wire transfer of millions of dollars from athe corporate treasury manager of the customer was watching the fund transfer stolen and shiftedbefore his very eyes, he was helpless in the context of such operation happening in few seconds.While the cyber reach was possible in seconds, the efforts of law enforcement took time to crossthe continental legal and criminal enactment barriers to overcome before they could ultimatelynab the above criminal.

Lawswere originally designed to protect tangible assets and may not be sufficient to guarantee theprotection of electronic bits of data. It is often difficult to attribute guilt using the existingstatutes since the act of trespassing into a system and tampering with virtual data may notnecessarily be specifically provided for in law. However, this point is being increasinglyrecognised as an area of concern and more and more countries are therefore enacting specific andModel acts passed by nations highly dependent on technology tend to provide for enhancedpenalties for unlawful access to "protected computers" such as those involved in nationalsecurity, banking and finance, emergency services and public utilities. Such laws also provide forpenalties for unlawful access to any system, unlawful modification of computer programs even6The Reserve Bank has for its part, made several initiatives in this regard. The framing of thesuch as the Bankers’ Book Evidence Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, the BankingRegulation Act and  the RBI Act – is in  an advanced stage. The Reserve Bank is also associatedwith the efforts of the Ministries of Finance, Commerce and Law in the enactment of laws suchThe imperative to enhance the levels of computerisation in the banking industry has beenstrengthened by the Government's IT vision which envisages a revolution in computerpenetration by the year 2010 and also by the directive recently issued by the Central VigilanceCommissioner to banks to computerise 70 per cent of banking business by January 2001. Theseinitiatives are important since many of the deficiencies of today's operations can be traced to theoutdated manual systems in place.  The CVC has also desired that the listed companies shouldcompulsorily offer the Electronic Clearing Services to their customers for payment of dividendand interest warrants. This  would help avoid the risks in the existing payment modes and reduceto a great extent the incidence of non-receipt of paper-based dividend and interest warrantsIn  future, there would be increasing focus on dematerialisation of shares and securities whichwould result in two advantages: first, the prevention of frauds and second, the facilitation ofAll organisations which are moving towards a high level of computerisation should have in placea security policy that  offers a shared vision of how controls in  workplaces should beimplemented with the objective of protecting location, information and eventually, the economicvalue of the organisation.

Work is,at banks who would look after all the requirements of computerisation and also ensure thatcomputer frauds do not occur. It is necessary that the work and operations of the group oftechnologically expert persons is monitored regularly by managements to ensure that crimes arenot perpetuated from inside. This is a challenge since over 2 lakh personnel had also received7It is also necessary to impart sufficient skills to our bank examiners to be able to examine recordseffectively in computerised operating environment and also to be able to put together a picture ofthe operations so that they could ensure that they have access to all transactions being putthrough by banks.
