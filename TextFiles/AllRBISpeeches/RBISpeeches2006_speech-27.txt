????Financial Sector Competition and Monetary Policy : CommentsMr. Chairman, Professor Mario Monti, Co-panellists and fellow Governors,I am honoured by the invitation to participate in the Annual General MeetingPanel in this historic and beautiful location. When I got the enquiry on mywillingness to be a panelist on “The Relevance of Competition and Monetary Policyfor Financial Stability” for the Per Jacobsson Foundation lecture this year, I initiallyfelt that the topic of the lecture was rather unconventional. But on deeper reflection,the significance struck me immensely.  It is a fascinating subject as we realisedtoday after hearing the Foundation Lecture. I am grateful to Professor Mario, the“anti-trust tsar”, also known as ‘Super Mario’, who is said to be “politically tone-deaf”, but tried hard to establish an international network of national competitionauthorities.My brief comments will be on:(a) The link between competition and monetary policy;(b) Recent developments that reinforce the link, particularly for thedeveloping countries;(c) Some issues relating to competition in the financial sector and monetarypolicy, especially from the perspective of the developing countries;(d) Indian policies to enhance competition in the financial sector; and(e) The implications for India’s monetary policy.There is a two-way linkage between competition and inflation; the latter isthe major objective of monetary policy. Professor Monti explained the link andsimilarities as well as dissimilarities in detail and so I will refer to one aspect only.Stable and low inflation reduces uncertainties and enhances competition.Competition leads to more efficient pricing, which in turn, contributes to lowinflation.  There is, thus, in some ways, a convergence between the ultimateobjectives of both competition and monetary policy.                                           ? Observations by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India as a panellist at the AnnualGeneral Meeting Panel of the Bank for International Settlements at Berne, Switzerland on June 25,2006There are three recent developments that reinforce the linkages especiallyfor emerging markets.  First, central bankers are increasingly using indirectinstruments of monetary policy and are thus, in a way, competitive players in themarket, to achieve their objective.  Second, fiscal rules, which are closely related tomonetary policy, operationally require that governments use markets to raise theirborrowing requirements.  Third, increasing liberalisation and global integration offinancial systems enhances competitive pressures, amongst major players andinstruments, which central bankers cannot afford to ignore.There are some issues relating to competition in the financial sector andmonetary policy, which are worth flagging.First, both efficient markets and successful use of market-based policyinstruments, require a strong legal framework and effective implementation.  Second, competition in the financial sector appears to be a little morecomplicated than in the non-financial sector.  For instance, consensus is still lackingon the separation of commercial and investment banking. Further, there aredifferences on issues of commercial affiliations of otherwise  ‘fit and proper’ ownersof banks. This issue was raised in the discussion today and Professor Monti alsofelt that it calls for deeper reflection. Major issue here is the potential for conflict ofinterest, in particular, the possible perception of such a conflict of interest in therealm of public opinion in respect of banks, which are highly leveraged withacceptance of uncollaterallised deposits.  Moreover, banks continue to be viewedas enjoying a special status in the financial sector, especially in the developingeconomies – which could be construed as unfair competition between banks andnon-banks.  It is also possible that banks have regulatory burdens disproportionateto their special nature and relative to non-banking intermediaries.Third, financial sector competition has two dimensions, namely,amongst the intermediaries and in terms of price discovery in financial markets.Here I am deliberately not referring to the fundamental issue raised in thediscussions on the Address by Prof. Jacob Frenkel on central banks’ monopolyover domestic money supply, and supply of foreign currency, in some ways.  Thathas been responded to by Professor Monti and Chairman Roth has also touchedon this aspect in his remarks.Fourth, by its very nature or as a matter of current practice in regardto most of the goods and services, the degree of financial sector competition variesacross countries. In other words, variability in the degree of competition in thefinancial sector across economies is perhaps more than those in the non-financialsector.  Fifth, the increased competition in the financial sector will enhanceefficiency and stability, if there is an acceptable minimal degree of competitiveefficiency in the product markets and, to some extent, factor markets, supported bysome comfort of sound institutions and practices.  The markets are mutuallyreinforcing, but, ideally, the competitive conditions in all the markets need to bebroadly in sync and avoid serious mis-alignments with each other.Sixth, some of the multi-national banks have assets exceeding theGross Domestic Product of many large emerging economies and hence theirproper functioning in such emerging markets is critical for genuine competition infinancial sector in such economies.Seventh, in the context of consolidation of commercial banking, theremay be considerable merit in recognising the usefulness of several categories oflocal banks particularly in larger economies.  A classic example of co-existence oflarge banks with locally active banks is the USA, where regulatory regime enablessuch possibilities without, perhaps, diluting underlying competitive pressure.Now, a few words on the policies to enhance financial sector competition in India –(a) We had, till reforms of early 90’s, an over-regulated, virtuallyadministered financial sector.  So, the process of deregulation impliedgradual removal of restrictions on the operation of the pricingmechanisms, especially interest rates and statutory liquidity and reserverequirements – a process which is still underway.(b) Markets have to be created, nurtured and developed, in the case offinancial assets – especially money, forex and government securities. Inemerging economies, there are complexities in parallel implementation ofmeasures for both development and integration of domestic as well asexternal markets in the financial sector, in contrast to being sequencedand spread over a period as it happened in major financial centres.  Anurturing policy is necessary for a simple reason.  In developed financialcentres, each centre evolved over a period in an organic fashion.  Fordeveloping countries, there are external compulsions which affect thepace and nature of development of markets.  This involved, in the Indiancase, putting in place appropriate policies, institutions, practices, etc.,including efficient market infrastructure and robust payment andsettlement system.(c) Enhanced competition in both banking and non-banking financial sectorshas been gradually introduced – through a dynamic mix of public andprivate as well as domestic and foreign ownership – along withderegulation or adaptive regulations.(d) Simultaneously, regulation and supervision of banks, financial marketsand infrastructure were improved to increasingly align them withinternational standards and best practices.     To conclude, let me mention four of the implications of enhanced competitionin financial sector for our monetary policy.First is the positive impact on both growth and price stability – especially dueto the competitive pressures in the banking sector.  Bank-finance still dominates thefinancing of the corporate sector, through loans and advances, subscription tocorporate bonds as also assisting in overseas operations in several ways, both intrade and investment.Second, in view of the enhanced competition, there is a clear evidence ofimproved monetary transmission mechanism – both through interest rate and creditchannels.Third, we, as the monetary authority, feel that increasingly competitivefinancial markets are playing enhanced feedback role in the financial system.  Theyhelp us not only in terms of information content on yield curves, but also in gaugingmarket expectations and designing better communications.Fourth, while competition in the domestic markets is in many ways,enhancing effectiveness of the monetary policy, the increasing integration of ourfinancial sector with global markets is, arguably, making the monetary policytransmission somewhat more complex than before. My co-panellist Governor AxelWeber made a mention of this aspect in his intervention.Finally, let me also respond to Professor Jacob Frenkel who raised the generalissue of focussing on the core-inflation in policy and not the headline inflation inspite of persistence of high oil prices for a long period.  In India, we could notconsider core-inflation for several reasons, especially because the two majorsources of supply shock, food and fuel, account for a large share of the index.  Inour case, pass through of higher oil prices has been halting and not full.  Thus, theheadline inflation in our country in a way understates the problem.  So, in ourmonetary policy communications we emphasised the fact that there is clearevidence of a permanent component in the oil price increase, and hence theheadline inflation may be understated till that component is fully passed through.While the permanent component is judgmental, broad magnitudes could beperceived and articulated. Such an explanatory approach to headline andunderlying inflation pressure in monetary policy has added credibility to the policyand influenced and guided the inflation expectations in India.Thank you.
