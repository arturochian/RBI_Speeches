FISCAL CHALLENGES OF POPULATION AGEING:THE ASIAN EXPERIENCE*Rakesh MohanI. IntroductionOne of the most critical demographic events in the world today is population ageing i.e.,the process by which the share of older individuals in the total population starts becominglarger. The ageing phenomenon, which has been initially experienced by  developed countries,is now steadily approaching the developing world. Projections show that over the next fivedecades, world median age will continue to increase, resulting in enhanced old age dependencyratios in all parts of the world. Thus, population ageing would be a major global public policyconcern in the twenty-first century posing unprecedented challenges for fiscal, monetary andoverall macro-economic management.There is a general consensus that ageing population reduces output growth, limitseconomic welfare and lowers employment. One direct effect of population ageing is labourshortages that are caused by declining birth rates and increasing life spans. This translates itselfinto a higher old-age dependency ratio (i.e., proportion of population aged 65 and older topopulation aged 15 to 64). Consequently, with ageing, the economy's capacity to sustain theelderly population would decline. An important consequence of this development is reflected inincreasing fiscal pressures through higher government spending on social security, health careand other welfare programs for the elderly accompanied by lower tax buoyancy consequent tofalling proportions of the productive labour force. Given the hard budget constraint for manydeveloping countries, this could mean lower government spending for programs that primarilybenefit the young. With public pension schemes coming under increasing pressure to raisecontribution levels or cut the size of social safety benefits, the issue of fiscal sustainability is oneof the principal challenges facing policymakers worldwide, particularly in the context ofintergenerational equity.                                                                * Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai, India.

Improvements in lifestandards, health care and nutrition have increased life expectancy. As a result, the old-agedependency ratio in OECD countries is projected to reach nearly 50 per cent by 2050. As hasbeen documented in this symposium, this is going to pose a huge fiscal burden in terms ofsocial security, health care, pension and other related expenditures. In this regard, an OECDexercise reveals a rise in old age pension spending, on an average, by about 3-4 percentagepoints of GDP over the period till 2050. Expenditure relating to health and long term medicalcare is estimated to increase by more than 3 percentage points of GDP over the same period.Overall, total age-related expenditures relative to GDP could rise on average by about 7percentage points over the period 2000-2050. In turn, this would imply an average decline of 6-7percentage points in the primary balance to GDP ratio.The economic impact of the decline in dependency ratios is usually beneficial and isoften referred as the ‘demographic dividend’. Many developing countries may temporarilyexperience increase in economic growth in the wake of a declining dependency ratio. Fallingbirthrates would increase female participation in the workforce thereby increasing the supply oflabour resulting in higher economic growth. An additional benefit from smaller families is thatparents would invest more in the education of children. Almost a third of East Asia’s growth inper capita income between 1965 and 1990 is attributed to the demographic dividend (Bloomand Williamson, 1998). The impetus to economic growth arising from declining dependencyratios, however, also depends on government policy. However, many Latin American countriesexperienced declining dependency ratios during the past 40 years without enjoying the rapideconomic growth of East Asian countries. It has been argued that recurrent financial crises andhigh trade tariffs in Latin America reduced the size of its demographic dividend (Bloom, Canningand Sevilla, 2001).Given the experiences of the developed (OECD) and Latin American countries, it isinteresting to compare those with the emerging scenario in Asia.  At present, most of thedeveloping countries in Asia are in the middle path of demographic transition and potentially in afavorable position on the economic front due to relatively large working populations. Thisdemographic dividend or “demographic gift” may not last long as the Asian population is ageingat a faster rate than global population with rapid improvement in nutrition and health care(Williamson, 2001). The policy options to handle this problem are wide and varied acrosscountries due to them being in different stages of the demographic transition. In this context, it is2important to examine whether (a) the experience of Asia will be similar to that of OECDcountries and (b) whether the policy stance of the developed countries could act as a role modelfor the developing ones or a unique/country-specific approach is required.Against the above backdrop, this paper focuses on the potential fiscal challenges ofpopulation ageing in Asia. The impact of this demographic change is seen primarily from aneconomist’s (and a Central Banker’s) viewpoint. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section II isin the nature of a digression and presents the conceptual and theoretical issues. The main focusis on review of the literature on ageing, impact on savings, social security and pensions. SectionIII discusses the demographic profile of select Asian countries, excluding Japan and Korea asthey are covered under OECD. Section IV highlights the impact of ageing on the fisc. Thereforms of the pension system and health care carried out by various Asian countries are alsocovered in this Section. The Indian experience would be discussed in a separate sub-sectionhighlighting emerging fiscal developments, changing demographic profile, fiscal implications ofgrowing pension payments and pension reforms and health care. Section V sets out the policyperspectives in terms of demographic transition including lessons drawn from developedcountries. Instead of the concluding observations, an approach to Asian ageing is presented inSection VI.II. Theoretical UnderpinningsDemographic Transition and AgeingDemographic transition is, in general, a process of change where society passes throughthe stages of high fertility and high mortality to low fertility and low mortality. Before the start ofthe demographic transition, life was short, births were many, growth was slow and thepopulation was young (Lee, 2003). The shift from high to low levels of fertility and mortality hasbeen explained through the different stages in the demographic transition theory.The modern transition theory is explained in four stages. In Stage I, the birth rate wasvery high and average longevity of life was short; therefore, population growth was relativelyslow and the population was fairly young. Significant medical advances, better health careservices, higher nutritional standards over the years have resulted in a drastic decline inmortality in almost all countries and a noticeable increase in the longevity of life. With this, thetransition enters Stage II. With increase of exogenous survival rates, parents’ family-size3decisions changed towards having fewer children. Besides, fertility rate is also influenced byhow economic change influences the cost and benefits of childbearing. With the advancementof technology and rapid changes of family structure vis-à-vis the opportunity cost of childbearing and rearing, fertility decline follow subsequently and drift downwards until it stabilises ata much lower plane. This is technically Stage III of demographic transition. The fourth and finalstage of demographic transition refers to low fertility and low mortality rates. While developedcountries are already in Stage IV of demographic transition for more than three decades, Asiancountries are passing through Stage II / Stage III as evident from their trends in total fertilityrates. For example, presently while Pakistan is in Stage II, India is in Stage III.Low fertility and increasing longevity cause a dramatic change in the population agedistribution. An increase in the old-age dependency ratio indicates a situation in which anincreasing number of potential beneficiaries of health and pension funds are supported by arelatively smaller number of potential contributors. This obviously imposes heavier demands onthe working-age population in order to maintain a stable intergenerational flow of benefits to theolder people. Given the existing social security arrangements and policies, the transitiontowards more elderly people relative to the number of workers will have pervasive effects onfactor and product markets and will substantially impact on public finances, with importantdistributional implications, both between existing retirees and the working age population as wellas between current and future generations (Visco, 2001).Fiscal ImplicationsThe fiscal impact of ageing population is reflected through higher government spendingon social security, health care and other welfare programs for the elderly. With public pensionschemes coming under increasing pressure to raise contribution levels or cut the size of socialsafety benefits, the issue of fiscal sustainability is one of the principal challenges facingpolicymakers worldwide, particularly, in the context of intergenerational equity. In this regard,the literature on social security and pensions has assumed critical importance.The principal rationale for mandatory social security programmes is that someindividuals lack the foresight to save for their retirement years. Since the provision of socialsecurity benefits imposes real costs and acts as a fiscal burden on several generations, theoptimal level of benefit requires balancing between the consideration of providing relief to the4elderly and the deprived sections of society while minimizing the costs of distorted real resourceallocation (Diamond, 1977). The issue has been compounded at the present juncture onaccount of a variety of factors, viz., (a) increasing proportion of old people, (b) higher degree ofurbanisation and greater migration from rural to urban areas, (c) diminishing support for oldpeople from families due to changes in family structure, (d) higher rearing cost of survivingchildren and (e) old people require greater resources and need support for a longer period. Assuch, the key issue is whether such support is provided by private or public funding. It may benoted that the inability of private provision implies greater reliance on public funding which is aburden on the fisc.In the Asian context, this issue is of great relevance as ageing is occurring at lowerincome levels. The redistribution of resources from younger to older generations has to beconcerned with the incentive for savings, keeping in view the need for higher investment insustaining the growth process. In addition to the redistribution of resources from young to old,there also have to be some resource transfers from the affluent to the less well off. While theredistribution from young to old has been traditional and would continue as long as possible forthose who cannot provide for themselves, the transfer of resources from rich to poor affectsincentives. One critical difference between developed and developing countries is that in thecase of the latter, as income growth is higher, pace of change in the standard of living is alsohigh which may be difficult to maintain in old age on the basis of savings accumulated at ayounger age. At the same time, since living standards are relatively low in developing countries,expectations about future standards of living are lower. Thus, more inter-generational resourcetransfers are warranted for developing countries.In thinking about the fiscal challenges arising from ageing, the first question that arises is: why these problems now?  It is true that longevity has increased tremendously in the past fewdecades, but some old have always been with us.  What is different now?In developing countries, and certainly in India, until recently, the provision for pensionsand care for the old was essentially privately provided, and usually within the family.  Why is thischanging now?• In rural areas, people essentially worked as long as they could.  There was no retirementage and job content changed according to capacity to work as people aged.5• With urbanization, in the first instance, the old people get left behind, and remittancesprovide for pension equivalents, encompassing inter generational resource transfers.• As urbanization proceeds, the issue of outside family provision arises, and is heightenedby labour mobility.• Earlier, when the retired were essentially expected to live until the age of 65 to 70, theissue of within family care arose for 5 to 10 years.  This was a feasible burden for thefamily.  Now with rising longevity, the within family care could extend to 20 or even 30years, and with delayed marriage, perhaps throughout the son or daughter's full workinglife. This is difficult to sustain.Thus, the problems of ageing are upon us in developing countries as well, and certainly inAsia.  We can clearly expect a shift from private to public provision in the years to come. Theissue for public policy in Asia is how fast this transition will take place and at what pace shouldpublic social security and pension provisions be made, with the consequent burdens on alreadystretched fiscal systems.   It has been argued that the provision of social security, particularly public pensions,reduces the inducement to save thereby having a damaging impact on a country’s long-termgrowth prospects. (Feldstein, 1977) This view has been countered by the multigenerationalplanning horizon theory of Barro (1978) which states that people making bequests is evidenceenough that they derive some benefit from the well being of future generations. Currentgenerations will therefore find that they need to save less to finance their own old age, but needto save more in order to increase their bequest sufficiently to compensate successivegenerations for their tax liabilities. These two effects should cancel each other leaving thesavings rate unchanged. This issue is of particular importance for developing countries in Asia,which will continue to need high savings for investment and growth for quite some time.Against the above background, let me now turn to the issues relating to ageing and theconsequent fiscal challenges in the Asian context.III. Ageing Population Profile: Select Asian Country Experiences6At present, the total fertility rate is below the replacement level in practically allindustrialized countries. In the less developed regions, fertility decline started later but hasproceeded faster than in the more developed regions. Over the last 50 years, the total fertilityrate (TFR) declined globally by almost half, from 5.0 to 2.7 children per woman. Over the nexthalf century, it expected to drop to the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. In thiscontext, it is important to note that Asia is roughly 50 years behind the developed nations.Within Asia, a great diversity in terms of demographic transition is noticeable.As per global estimates, currently, the average annual growth of the older population2(60+) is 1.9 per cent, which is noticeably higher than that of total population at 1.2 per cent(Table 1). More significantly, the average annual growth rate of persons aged 80 years and over(3.8 per cent) is currently twice as high as the growth rate of the population over 60 years of age(1.9 per cent). Projected figures clearly indicate a much    higher   growth   rate   of    olderpeople in 25 to 50 years ahead. In terms of percentage, the aged constituted 8.2 per cent oftotal population in 1950; this percentage rose slowly to 10 per cent of world’s population in 2000and is projected to rise to 21.1 per cent in 2050 (Table 2). During that time, world population ofthe aged is expected to exceed the population of children in the age group 0-14 years (Table 3).Table 1: Trends in Average Annual Population Growth RateRegions/Countries 1950-55 1975-80 2000-02 2025-30 2045-50World 1.8 1.7 1.2 0.8 0.5More developed regions 1.2 0.6 0.2 0.0 -0.2Less developed regions 2.1 2.1 1.5 1.0 0.6Least developed regions 1.9 2.4 2.5 2.0 1.4Asia 1.9 1.9 1.3 0.7 0.3Eastern Asia 1.8 1.4 0.7 0.2 -0.3South-central Asia 2.0 2.2 1.7 1.0 0.6South-eastern Asia 2.1 2.2 1.4 0.8 0.4Western Asia 2.6 2.7 2.1 1.6 1.1China 1.9 1.5 0.7 0.2 -0.3India 2.0 2.1 1.5 0.8 0.4Bangladesh 2.0 2.4 2.1 1.1 0.7Sri Lanka 2.5 1.6 0.9 0.3 -0.1Pakistan 2.0 2.9 2.5 1.7 1.0Indonesia 1.7 2.2 1.2 0.7 0.3Thailand 3.0 2.3 1.1 0.5 0.0Malaysia 2.7 2.3 1.7 1.0 0.5Philippines 3.0 2.7 1.9 1.0 0.5Source: United Nations, "World Population Ageing 1950-2050”, Population Division, Departmentof Economic and Social Affairs, 2002                                                                1 Following the UN classification, the ageing indicator has been taken as 60 years and above.7Table 2: Trends in Proportion of Older People (60+)Regions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 8.1 8.6 10.0 15.0 21.0More developed regions 11.8 15.4 19.4 28.2 33.5Less developed regions 6.4 6.2 7.7 12.6 19.2Least developed regions 5.4 5.0 4.9 5.9 9.5Asia 6.8 6.7 8.8 14.7 22.6Eastern Asia 7.4 7.4 11.2 20.8 30.7South-Central Asia 6.1 6.1 7.0 11.2 18.6South-East Asia 6.0 5.7 7.1 12.7 22.0Western Asia 7.2 6.6 7.1 10.3 15.6China 7.5 6.9 10.2 19.5 29.9India 5.6 6.2 7.6 12.5 20.6Bangladesh 6.2 5.5 4.9 8.4 16.0Sri Lanka 7.3 6.4 9.3 18.0 27.6Pakistan 8.3 5.5 5.7 7.3 12.5Indonesia 6.2 5.3 7.6 12.8 22.4Thailand 5.1 5.0 8.1 17.1 27.1Malaysia 7.3 5.6 6.6 13.4 20.8Philippines 5.5 5.0 5.6 10.4 19.6Source: United Nations, "World Population Ageing 1950-2050” Population Division, Department ofEconomic and Social Affairs, 2002Table 3: Trends in Proportion of Young People (0-14)Regions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 34.3 36.7 30.0 24.3 21.0More developed regions 27.3 24.2 18.3 15.0 15.5Less developed regions 37.6 41.1 32.8 26.0 21.8Least developed regions 41.1 44.7 43.1 37.9 29.1Asia 36.5 39.6 30.2 22.9 19.5Eastern Asia 34.1 37.8 23.9 17.9 16.1South-Central Asia 38.6 40.7 35.2 25.7 20.8South-East Asia 38.9 42.1 32.4 23.5 19.8Western Asia 38.5 41.7 35.9 30.2 25.0China 33.5 39.5 24.8 18.4 16.3India 38.9 39.8 33.5 23.2 19.7Bangladesh 37.6 45.4 38.7 28.1 22.0Sri Lanka 40.1 36.9 26.3 20.0 17.3Pakistan 37.9 42.0 41.8 34.4 23.1Indonesia 39.2 41.4 30.8 23.0 19.9Thailand 42.1 42.6 26.7 19.6 17.1Malaysia 40.9 42.1 34.1 23.6 19.8Philippines 43.6 44.2 37.5 24.9 20.3Source: United Nations, "World Population Ageing 1950-2050”, Population Division, Departmentof Economic and Social Affairs, 20028The Asian continent, with its large size, wide socio-economic and demographicdisparities is better understood and interpreted when studied at country level. Accordingly,2selected countries are categorised into three broad groups as indicated below.I:     Indian Sub-Continent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka)II:   ChinaIII:  East Asian Tigers (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand)The young-old balance of population is shifting throughout the world.  The increasingproportion of aged people is accompanied by a falling proportion of young persons.  Indeveloped countries, the proportion of older persons already exceeds that of children, and by2050, it is expected to be twice that of younger persons.   What is notable, however, is that theproportion of working age people in developed countries has been roughly constant over thelast 50 years at around 60 per cent (Table 4), and has in fact increased slightly with the floatover baby boom.  The overall dependency ratio has therefore not increased (Table 5).  Theissue of concern in developed countries is that the proportion of working age people is nowexpected to decline from these levels to about 50 per cent by 2050, with the corresponding risein dependency ratios : hence the heightened concern with ageing in recent years in developedcountries.  What is most dramatic is the expected rise in old age dependency (i.e., those in the65 years + age bracket as a proportion of the working age group 15-64 years).  In developedcountries it is around 21 per cent now, rising to 33 per cent by 2025 and as much as 46 per centby 2050 (Table 6).Table 4: Trends in Proportion of Working Age Population (15-59)Regions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 57.6 54.7 60.0 60.7 58.0More developed regions 60.9 60.4 62.3 56.8 51.0Less developed regions 56.0 52.7 59.5 61.4 59.0Least developed regions 53.5 50.3 52.0 56.2 61.4Asia 56.7 53.7 61.0 62.4 57.9Eastern Asia 58.5 54.8 64.9 61.3 53.2South-Central Asia 55.3 53.2 57.8 63.1 60.6South-East Asia 55.1 52.2 60.5 63.8 58.2Western Asia 54.3 51.7 57.0 59.5 59.4China 59.0 53.6 65.0 62.1 53.8                                                                2 Japan and Republic of Korea have been excluded as they are classified as OECD countries.9India 55.5 54.0 58.9 64.3 59.7Bangladesh 56.2 49.1 56.4 63.5 62.0Sri Lanka 52.6 56.7 64.4 62.0 55.1Pakistan 53.8 52.5 52.5 58.3 64.4Indonesia 54.6 53.3 61.6 64.2 57.7Thailand 52.8 52.4 65.2 63.3 55.8Malaysia 51.8 52.3 59.3 63.0 59.4Philippines 50.9 50.8 56.9 64.7 60.1Source: United Nations, "World Population Ageing 1950-2050”, Population Division, Department ofEconomic and Social Affairs, 2002Table 5: Trends in Total Dependency RatioRegions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 65.2 73.7 58.4 53.2 57.7More developed regions 54.4 53.8 48.3 57.0 73.4Less developed regions 71.0 81.8 61.1 52.5 55.7Least developed regions 79.7 91.5 86.0 71.4 54.9Asia 68.3 78.0 56.5 49.0 56.8Eastern Asia 62.9 74.1 46.2 47.8 66.0South-Central Asia 73.4 80.1 65.9 49.5 51.4South-East Asia 74.4 84.0 58.9 46.7 56.1Western Asia 75.2 85.3 68.5 59.0 57.1China 61.3 78.2 46.4 46.2 63.9India 73.2 77.4 62.5 46.1 52.6Bangladesh 70.2 95.4 71.9 50.0 49.0Sri Lanka 83.7 69.3 48.3 47.8 62.9Pakistan 76.3 83.0 83.4 64.6 45.9Indonesia 75.8 80.6 55.2 45.7 57.1Thailand 83.1 84.4 46.8 44.8 61.9Malaysia 85.0 84.6 61.9 48.4 54.4Philippines 89.3 89.7 69.7 46.6 52.0Note: The total dependency ratio is the number of persons under age 15 years plus persons aged 65years or older per one hundred persons in the category of 15 to 64 years.

The proportion of oldpeople in Asia (excluding Japan and Korea) today is around 8.8 per cent and will reach 22-23per cent by 2050.  However, similar to the developed country experience of the past 50 years,the working age population in Asia is about 60 per cent now; it will rise marginally by 2025 andthen fall slightly by 2050.  In the case of China it is now 65 per cent and will fall gradually toaround 55 per cent by 2050.  India, Indonesia and other Asian countries will remain between 60and 65 per cent until around 2050.  The expected increase in old age dependency is alsodramatic : from about 9 per cent now to 15 per cent in 2025 and 26 per cent by 2050, whichwould be a little higher than that in developed countries now.  The Chinese, however, areageing faster with the old age dependency ratio rising from about 10 per cent now to anexpected 19 per cent in 2025 and 37 per cent in 2050.  For India and Indonesia, the rise will bemuch slower, whereas the situation in Sri Lanka and Thailand will be more like that in China(Table 6).11What is really different between developed countries and Asia is the expected trend intotal dependency ratio (Table 7).  The key fiscal problem of developed countries is theunprecedented rapid rise that is expected in the total dependency ratio (young + old as aproportion of the working age groups) from about 48 per cent now to 57 per cent in 2025 and 73per cent in 2050.  In 1950, incidentally, it was 54 per cent.  For Asia as a whole it was 66 percent in 1950, 56 now, falling to about 49 per cent by 2025 and then rising again to 57 per centby 2050, with differences between countries as expected between China and other Asiancountries.  Countries such as India, Indonesia and others will continue to reap the demographicdividend for at least another 25 years.Table 7: Trends in Young-Age Dependency RatioRegions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 56.7 63.8 47.5 37.3 33.1More developed regions 42.2 37.2 27.1 23.6 26.9Less developed regions 64.3 74.7 52.9 39.7 33.9Least developed regions 73.8 85.6 80.2 64.9 45.2Asia 61.4 70.5 47.3 34.1 30.6Eastern Asia 55.6 65.9 34.9 26.4 26.7South-Central Asia 66.9 73.3 58.3 38.4 31.4South-East Asia 67.8 77.5 51.5 34.5 31.0Western Asia 67.5 77.3 60.5 48.0 39.3China 54.1 70.4 36.4 26.8 26.7India 67.4 70.6 54.4 33.9 30.0Bangladesh 64.0 88.6 66.5 42.2 32.8Sri Lanka 73.6 62.6 39.0 29.6 28.2Pakistan 66.9 76.8 76.6 56.7 33.8Indonesia 68.9 74.7 47.7 33.5 31.3Thailand 77.1 78.6 39.1 28.4 27.7Malaysia 75.7 77.7 55.2 35.0 30.6Philippines 82.5 83.9 63.7 36.5 30.9Note: The youth dependency ratio is the number of persons 0 to 14 years per one hundred persons 15 to64 years.Source: United Nations, "World Population Ageing 1950-2050”, Population Division, Department ofEconomic and Social Affairs, 20023The total dependency ratio is a rough measure of potential social support needs . Theexpected decline is due to the fact that young-age dependency ratio of all these countries islikely to decrease very rapidly due to sharp decline in total fertility rate during this period.                                                                3 However, it must be recognized that the dependency ratio gives no more than a rough approximation of the burdenof dependency. Not all young and old persons require support, nor do all working-age persons actually providedirect or indirect support. On the contrary, older persons in many societies are providers of support to their adultchildren. Thus, although a useful indicator of trends in the level of potential support needs, the dependency ratio,and particularly the old-age dependency ratio, should be used cautiously (United Nations 2002).12However, the decline of young-age dependency ratio during the next 25 years, i.e., 2025-2050for most of the Asian nations is expected to be relatively small.In view of the declining dependency ratio in Asia, there is greater room formaneuverability in public finances in terms of social security expenditure. A critical issue is therelative emphasis on expenditure related to the next generation viz., child rearing and educationvis-à-vis expenditure on the earlier generation on account of medical and health care.Old-age dependency ratio of China is likely to increase by almost four times during thenext half century from  10.0 per cent in 2000 to 37.2 per cent in 2050 (Table 6). The othercountries likely to have similar trends are Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Philippines. In the case ofIndia, old-age dependency ratio during 2000-2025 is going to increase by almost 1.5 times (8.1per cent in 2000 to 12.2 per cent in 2025); however next 25 years is likely to witness a sharperincrease of around 2 times (from 12.2 per cent in 2025 to 22.6 per cent in 1950) (Table 7).Globally, the ageing index is going to increase rapidly and will triple over the next halfcentury. Higher increase in ageing index during 2000-2050 period is more significant for most ofthe Asian countries (see Table 8). This trend may lead to compelling demands for changes inthe way a society’s resources are shared between generations. The median age of all the Asiancountries is expected to increase by 12 years during the first half of the current century (seeTable 9).Table 8: Trends in Ageing IndexRegions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 23.8 23.4 33.4 61.5 100.5More developed regions 42.9 63.7 106.2 187.7 215.3Less developed regions 17.2 15.1 23.4 48.2 88.6Least developed regions 13.2 11.2 11.3 15.7 32.5Asia 18.5 16.8 29.0 64.3 115.7Eastern Asia 21.7 19.5 47.3 116.5 190.5South-Central Asia 15.9 15.0 20.1 43.3 89.8South-East Asia 15.5 13.5 22.1 54.1 110.7Western Asia 18.5 15.7 19.8 34.3 62.4China 22.3 17.6 40.7 106.5 183.3India 14.4 15.6 22.7 53.6 105.0Bangladesh 16.4 12.2 12.8 29.8 72.9Sri Lanka 18.3 17.2 35.3 90.2 159.5Pakistan 21.7 13.1 13.8 21.1 53.8Indonesia 15.9 13.0 24.7 55.8 112.1Thailand 12.0 11.7 30.5 87.3 158.1Malaysia 17.9 13.3 19.3 56.7 104.9Philippines 12.7 11.2 14.8 41.7 95.913Note: The ageing index is calculated as the number of persons 60 years old or over per hundred personsunder age of 15 years.Source: United Nations, “World Population Ageing 1950-2050”,Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2002Table 9: Trends in Median AgeRegions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 23.6 22.0 26.5 32.0 36.2More developed regions 28.6 30.9 37.4 44.1 46.4Less developed regions 21.4 19.4 24.3 30.0 35.0Least developed regions 19.5 17.6 18.2 20.8 26.5Asia 22.0 20.3 26.2 33.1 38.3Eastern Asia 23.5 21.5 30.8 39.8 44.3South-Central Asia 20.7 19.5 22.6 29.4 36.1South-East Asia 20.4 18.7 23.9 32.1 37.9Western Asia 20.4 18.9 22.1 26.6 31.4China 23.9 20.6 30.0 39.0 43.8India 20.4 20.0 23.7 31.3 38.0Bangladesh 21.6 17.2 20.2 26.9 34.8Sri Lanka 20.3 20.8 27.8 36.7 42.0Pakistan 21.2 19.0 18.9 22.8 31.8Indonesia 20.0 19.1 24.6 33.0 38.0Thailand 18.6 18.3 27.5 36.6 42.1Malaysia 19.8 18.6 23.3 31.2 37.8Philippines 18.2 17.6 20.9 29.2 37.0Source: United Nations, “World Population Ageing 1950-2050”,Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2002Economic Characteristic and Determinants of AgeingLabour force participation of the older people has declined worldwide over the lastdecades (see Table 10). In general, labour force participation of the older people of Asiancountries is much higher than that of developed countries. However, disparity in labour forceparticipation among Asian countries persists. Higher labour force participation of older ages inAsian countries clearly indicates that old-age support systems in the form of pension andretirement programmes are relatively less prevalent in these countries (as compared todeveloped countries).Table 10: Trends in Labour Force Participation (65+)Regions/Countries 1950 1975 2000 2025 2050World 31.9 24.6 19.9 18.8 17.9More developed regions 23.3 15.0 9.1 8.4 7.7Less developed regions 40.1 33.9 28.4 25.9 23.914Least developed regions NA NA NA NA NAAsia 37.9 32.7 27.2 24.5 22.3Eastern Asia 30.4 25.8 20.5 18.0 15.6South-Central Asia 44.5 39.9 34.6 31.7 29.3South-East Asia 51.0 43.4 38.0 34.5 31.2Western Asia 45.2 34.1 25.2 23.4 21.5China 29.3 24.0 19.3 16.9 14.5India 44.1 41.1 34.8 32.1 29.6Bangladesh 62.5 60.9 50.9 46.6 42.9Sri Lanka 52.0 30.3 18.7 15.6 13.4Pakistan 52.3 41.8 33.7 30.1 27.5Indonesia 58.2 47.0 39.8 35.2 30.8Thailand 44.4 36.3 28.4 26.1 24.1Malaysia 40.9 31.6 29.2 26.6 24.7Philippines 37.0 42.7 42.5 39.1 36.0Note: The labour force participation rate consists of the economically active population in aparticular age group as a percentage of the total population of that same age group.

Fertility of moredeveloped countries with TFR is below replacement level since the last three decades. The TFRof less developed countries is twice than that of developed countries and this trend is expectedto continue till 2030. The higher regional differences in fertility among Asian countries areexpected to decrease (see Table 11).  The projected fertility transition has been relativelysmoother in India and Philippines. These countries are, therefore, in a favourable position (andthus may enjoy the fruits of ‘demographic dividend’ for a relatively longer period) as far as theinflow of working-age populations are concerned.Table 11: Trends in Total Fertility RateRegions/Countries 1950-55 1975-80 2000-05 2025-30 2045-50World 5.0 3.9 2.7 2.3 2.1More developed regions 2.8 1.9 1.5 1.7 1.9Less developed regions 6.2 4.6 2.9 2.4 2.2Least developed regions 6.6 6.4 5.2 3.6 2.5Asia 5.9 4.2 2.5 2.1 2.1Eastern Asia 5.7 3.1 1.8 1.9 1.9South-Central Asia 6.1 5.1 3.2 2.2 2.1South-East Asia 6.0 4.9 2.5 2.1 2.1Western Asia 6.4 5.2 3.6 2.8 2.4China 6.2 3.3 1.8 1.9 1.915India 6.0 4.8 3.0 2.1 2.1Bangladesh 6.7 5.7 3.6 2.1 2.1Sri Lanka 5.9 3.8 2.1 1.9 1.9Pakistan 6.3 6.3 5.1 2.8 2.1Indonesia 5.5 4.7 2.3 2.1 2.1Thailand 6.4 4.0 2.0 1.9 1.9Malaysia 6.8 4.2 2.9 2.1 2.1Philippines 7.3 5.5 3.2 2.1 2.1Note: The total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman would bear over thecourse of her lifetime if current age-specific fertility rates remained constant throughout herchildbearing years (normally between the ages of 15 and 49).

Over the last five decades, life expectancy atbirth increased globally by almost 20 years, from 46.5 years in 1950-55 to 66.0 years in 2000-05(Table 12). Among Asian countries, there exists a great degree of variation in life expectancy atbirth. However, the extent of regional variations in life expectancy at birth among thesecountries is gradually narrowing down.Table 12: Trends in Life Expectancy (years) at BirthRegions/Countries 1950-55 1975-80 2000-05 2025-30 2045-50World 46.5 59.8 66.0 72.4 76.0More developed regions 66.2 72.3 75.6 80.0 82.1Less developed regions 41.0 56.8 64.1 70.9 75.0Least developed regions 35.5 45.3 51.4 62.8 69.7Asia 41.3 58.4 67.4 73.9 77.1Eastern Asia 42.9 66.4 72.3 77.3 79.7South-central Asia 39.3 52.5 63.3 70.9 74.9South-eastern Asia 41.0 54.6 67.0 74.0 77.3Western Asia 45.2 60.5 70.0 75.7 78.5China 40.8 65.3 71.2 76.3 79.0India 38.7 52.9 64.2 71.6 75.4Bangladesh 36.6 46.7 60.7 70.6 75.0Sri Lanka 55.5 66.4 72.6 77.2 79.5Pakistan 41.0 51.0 61.0 69.7 73.7Indonesia 37.5 52.7 67.3 73.9 77.4Thailand 52.0 61.4 70.8 76.8 79.1Malaysia 48.5 65.3 73.0 77.4 79.7Philippines 47.8 60.1 70.0 75.5 78.4Source: United Nations, "World Population Ageing 1950-2050”,Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 200216IV. Ageing Population and its Fiscal ImpactIn the last decade, both the IMF (Heller et al., 1986; Chand and Jaeger, 1996) andOECD (1985, 1988, 1996 and 2001) have carried out a number of studies on the fiscal impact ofageing of major industrial countries. An important objective has been to assess, ex ante, thepotential impact on public expenditure from the provision or financing of social services andtransfers. Normally, the base line projections assume unchanged social insurance legislationand social sector policies by the government. Most studies have concluded that, althoughoutlays on education will decline as a share of GDP, this will be offset by rapid growth ofgovernment outlays on pensions and medical care. For most industrial countries, thegovernment social insurance commitments appear inadequately funded. Financial sustainabilitywill be achieved only by a combination of cutbacks in benefits or an increase in contributionrates.Many Asian countries suffer from the chronic malaise of fiscal imbalances: expendituresare much higher than government revenue. As a large section of the population survives at low-income levels, the tax base is weak and tax revenues grossly inadequate. Moreover, tax ratesare distortionary and tax compliance is low. Current expenditures are high resulting in a paucityof resources for capital expenditure. Hence, deficits are an enduring feature of many Asianeconomies.Public Finance in Select Asian CountriesBased on the classification presented in Section II of select Asian countries, it may benoted that the average growth (over three years) in the Indian subcontinent was 4.2 per centwith India having the highest growth of 5.4 per cent (Table 13). Among all the countries underconsideration, China has the highest growth of 7.8 per cent. Among the South East AsianTigers, the average growth is 4.2 per cent with Indonesia recording the highest growth of 4.4 percent and Philippines the least growth of 3.9 per cent.Table 13: Savings, Investment and GDPGrowth in Select Asian Countries (Average of 3 years: 2000-2002)Domestic Savings Investment GDP Growth Rate (PerCountries (Per cent of GDP) (Per cent of GDP) cent)India 23.8 21.9 5.4Bangladesh 17.3 23.0 5.1Pakistan 13.7 15.7 3.5Sri Lanka 15.3 23.7 2.817Average 17.5 21.1 4.2China 41.0 38.3                  7.8Indonesia 24.3 16.3 4.4Malaysia 45.3 26.3 4.3Philippines 21.0 18.3 3.9Thailand 30.7 23.7 4.1Average 30.3 21.2 4.2Source: 1.

Among thesecountries, India has relatively higher savings rates of 23.8 per cent with Pakistan having thelowest rate of 13.7 per cent. Among all the countries, Malaysia has the highest savings rate of45.3 per cent with China coming a close second with 41.0 per cent. The average savings rate ofSouth East Asian countries is around 30.3 per cent with Philippines having the least rate of 21.0per cent. Similarly, investment rates are very high for China and least for Pakistan.On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit of the Government on average seems to be thehighest for the Indian subcontinent (Table 14). The situation in the South East Asian countries isrelatively better with lower levels of deficit.Table 14: Major Fiscal Indicators of Governmentsin Select Asian Countries (Average of 3 years: 2000-2002)                                                                                                                       (% of GDP)TotalExpenditureFiscal Deficit Current Revenue Countries  India@ 9.7 17.7 28.3Bangladesh 2.8 9.3 12.7Pakistan 5.7 16.1 22.0Sri Lanka 8.7 17.0 25.3Average 6.7 15.0 22.1China 2.9 7.2 10.9Indonesia 1.1 19.1 21.8Malaysia -0.5#$ 24.8 # 24.5 #Philippines 4.0 15.5 19.5Thailand 5.4 16.5 20.9Average 2.5 19.0 21.7 18# Average for two years 2000 and 2001$ represents a fiscal surplus@ pertains to Centre and States adjusted for Inter-governmental transactions.Source: 1.

World Development Indicators 2004, World Bank.Fiscal impact of ageingHow and when the problem of ageing of Asian population manifests itself will haveimportant implications for the structure of the social and fiscal policy choices confronting theAsian economies in the coming years. In terms of timing, the countries fall into three principal4groups : (i) the East Asian countries – the most demographically mature and developed ineconomic terms including Korea and Taiwan, (ii) South East Asia including Indonesia, Malaysia,Philippines and Thailand which has recently experienced significant declines in fertility andincreased life expectancy, but where the further maturing of these indicators can be expectedand where per capita income levels are still relatively low compared to East Asia and (iii) China19and the Indian subcontinent, where the ageing process is occurring somewhat later and which isfar less economically developed.The demographic transition reflected in the ageing population of Asia has resulted fromthe combined effect of successful public health campaigns and rising income levels. Anadditional consequence of these trends towards greater longevity and a broadly healthierpopulation has been that there is increasingly a convergence in the morbidity and mortalityprofiles of the Asian population towards those now observed in the industrial economies. Theseepidemiological trends will create pressures for increased spending on medical care in thecoming decades. It will enhance the impact of the demographic trends resulting in increasingfinancial pressure after 2010 in East Asia and somewhat later in rest of the countries. Inparticular, India is expected to face greater fiscal stress after 2015 (Lee, 2003).In contrast to the dominant role of governments in the financing of the social sector inindustrial countries, government commitment is far less comprehensive in Asian countries, withmajor segments of the population not covered by social security and many areas of effectivesocial security are still in the private domain. Public pension systems exhibit considerablevariety in Asia, but a principal characteristic is the absence (except Korea and Taiwan) of thekind of comprehensive coverage, defined benefits, pay-as-you-go public pension systemsobserved in Western Europe and United States. Some countries have introduced providentfunds, but these are largely focussed on workers in the formal sector.The situation in the medical care sector is more varied. Some of the East Asiancountries have introduced comprehensive and innovative health insurance reforms, with varyingdegrees of public sector participation, that have attempted to nationalize the financing ofmedical care. In others, medical insurance coverage is limited primarily to those in the formalsector, with others in the population obtaining medical care directly from government hospitalsand health centers or from private sector practitioners. In education sector, the government’sinvolvement has focused on the primary and secondary sectors; its provision of tertiaryeducation has typically been quite limited. This suggests that the question of how muchadditional pressures for government expenditure will emerge from the ageing of the Asian                                                                                                                                                                                                                4 Since this categorisation is done from the viewpoint of the fiscal impact of population ageing, this is different fromwhat has been followed in Section III20population may prove to be a question of whether government policies evolve in the direction ofexpanded coverage and enhanced social insurance policy commitments.Health and Medical CareIn the context of OECD countries, it has been found that while the medical expenditurefor the entire population would increase by 6.7 times between 1986 and 2025, that of the elderlypopulation is expected to rise by 10 times during the same period (Dhar Chakraborty, 2004). Ifthe same cost pattern were assumed, there would be a tremendous shift of resources. In thecontext of Asian countries, the main difference is that the problem is likely to be more acute asageing occurs at lower per capita income levels vis-à-vis OECD countries because of theglobalisation of public health measures and the quality of health care. Moreover, Asian countrieshave to meet the dual need of funding higher investment to sustain growth and rising socialexpenditure on account of an ageing population. However, as saving rates are expected tocontinue to be higher in Asian countries, it may not necessarily inhibit the process of capitalformation.In most Asian countries, long-term medical facilities cannot be met through regularmarket service providers. Provision of such services through community-based schemes willonly add to the financial burden. Moreover, old age family care schemes are an additionalburden. In addition to the financial resources, population ageing is likely to demand a great dealof human resources in terms of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel and infrastructureon medical facilities to deal with an ageing population. Moreover, shift in disease patternsfurther compound the problem in Asian countries. In addition to infectious diseases, malnutritionetc., Asian countries are also faced with the growth of non-communicable diseases, whichstrains the already scarce resources to the limit. Therefore, considerable expenditure onmedical care is required to pursue efficient and effective health care programs to tackle bothcommunicable and non-communicable diseases.ReformsThe role of the government in the health and medical care sectors of the Asian countriesis quite varied. At present, most Asian countries spend about 5 per cent of their GDP on healthas compared to 14 per cent in the US and other developed countries. Since ageing is not yet amajor issue, the developing countries of Asia are yet to develop special health care21programmes for the aged. Since government expenditure on health care is not adequate, mostAsian countries have income elasticity of health care above one.Most of the East Asian countries have introduced health insurance reforms that seek torationalize the financing of medical care in order to cope with the changing pattern of medicaldemand and use market principles to contain costs. The medical insurance programmes inKorea and Taiwan have nearly universal coverage while it is substantial in Singapore. Fundingis largely derived from a combination of employer and employee contributions, budgetarytransfers and direct co-payments by patients in both public and private sectors. Although mostschemes are formally in the private sector, they involve some degree of public regulation ormanagement.  However, their financial operations are not included in the government’sbudgetary accounts. In China, on the other hand, medical insurance effectively covers about 20per cent of the population. Among these, the maximum benefit accrues to workers in the civilservice mainly in the urban areas. However, no more than half of the urban population is undera formal medical insurance scheme. For 75 per cent of China’s population that lived in ruralareas, only 5.4 per cent were covered under collectively financed co-operative medical caresystems in the early 1990s (Hsaio, 1995).Among the South East Asian Tigers, government has sought to provide medical servicesthrough government hospitals and health centers. Outlays have been financed directly from thebudget and, to a lesser extent, from user fees. Fiscal restraint has resulted in inadequatemedical facilities in urban centers and more limited primary care facilities in rural areas. Overtime, the private sector has grown in significance. Only in Indonesia and Philippines is moreextensive medical insurance system being gradually developed. In Indonesia, since 1993, acompulsory health insurance scheme is being introduced gradually for all workers, withcontribution paid entirely by employers although the coverage is restricted to civil servants andformal sector workers. In the Indian sub-continent, medical insurance and health care reforms isat a primary stage with the principal medical facilities located in the urban areas. Although thereis large contingent of private practitioners, they are mainly city based and the per capitaavailability of medical care in rural areas is quite low.The financial effect of ageing populations is significant in the medical care sector.Focusing initially on the East Asian countries, which are the most mature in terms of agedistribution and health insurance system, demographic factors would suggest that gradualincreases of about 10 per cent might be expected per decade in the ratio of medical expenditure22to GDP. While medical expenditure in Korea and Taiwan could rise to about 9 per cent of GDPby 2025, China and South East Asia would not have a significant impact until at least 2020(Heller, 1997). In East Asia, government budget outlays would rise, on average by only 0.2 percent of GDP by 2010 with somewhat more substantial increases in the successive decades. InChina, pressure on government outlays would emerge after 2020 with the expenditure sharerising by less than 1 per cent of GDP by 2050. In South East Asia, government medical careoutlays as share of GDP would barely change over the next 50 years (Heller, 1997).EducationIn Asian countries, the government’s involvement in the education sector has been mostextensive in terms of primary schooling, where enrollment rates are virtually universal. It is alsothe principal provider of secondary education, though here the private sector plays a moresignificant role in some countries (notably, Indonesia, Korea and India). Secondary enrollmentrates which typically range from 40-75 per cent while high by developing country standards, aresignificantly below the average rates of 86 per cent observed in more developed countries.Government involvement is far lower in the tertiary sector (with the exception of Korea). Privatesector involvement, either through private universities (so-called long distance training), or theacquisition of education at overseas universities, is far more common at this level.  The absolute size of the school age population is projected to grow by a limited extent inSouth East Asia (Heller, 1997). In China and East Asia, this group will fall in size suggesting thepossibility of some fiscal savings. Since public spending on education is typically 2-4 per cent ofGDP, it is plausible that reductions in government expenditure are non-trivial. Projectionssuggest that government expenditure on education could fall by about one per cent of GDP by2010 with more modest reductions thereafter by 2025. In China, only modest reduction ingovernment educational spending – less than 0.4 per cent of GDP will be observed through2010 and only slightly by 2025 and thereafter. If enrollment rates in higher education were toincrease to 20 per cent, overall government outlays on education is likely to increase. Overall,the potential reduction in education expenditure may be muted because of the elongation oftime spent in education and greater emphasis on technical and professional education,improvement in the quality of education, all of which will be very necessary for the productivitygrowth that is necessary for economic growth and improved standards of living in Asia.235Public Pension SystemPerhaps the most significant impact of population ageing is on the pension system, inparticular, and on the fiscal situation, in general. The choice of policies for stabilizing the fiscalsituation is therefore important, especially if the governments decide to pursue a somewhatfaster pace of consolidation to reduce its exposures to fiscal risks. While one option is to shifttowards fully funded pension liabilities and more generally encouraging a diversified range ofretirement income sources, another option is modifying public pension generosity and eligibilitycriteria by elongating the average numbers of years in the work force or service. In this regard,the pension reforms have taken the form of both structural and parametric changes. Thereforms in many countries have focused on the more from unfunded to funded arrangements inorder to address the issue of growing pension liabilities. This has led to creation of large sizedpension funds necessitating appropriate institutional frameworks to ensure safety of investedfunds.Public pension systems exhibit considerable variety among the Asian countries. OnlyKorea and Taiwan have defined benefit, pay-as-you-go, public pension systems with largelyuniversal coverage of the workforce. Taiwan’s scheme (which was expanded in 1983) results ina lump-sum benefit upon retirement, in contrast to Korea’s more recently introduced scheme,which will result in a retirement annuity. Coverage is relatively comprehensive for the mandatoryprovident funds of Malaysia and Singapore. These are defined contribution schemes whichresult largely in lump sum withdrawal benefits upon retirement, but which allow earlierwithdrawals for specified purposes (e.g., higher education for dependents, major medicalexpenses, housing). The latter schemes are subject to government regulation or    management(in terms of governance provisions and investment policies).    The provisions of the systemssuggest that the principal risks of inadequate savings (due to unanticipated inflation, poor yieldon savings, or longer-than-expected-life spans) are almost wholly borne by the contributingpopulations (Heller, 1997).In the other Asian countries, the government’s involvement in the pension sphere ispresently much more limited, although some countries are considering or have recently                                                                5 The discussion in this Section draws on Heller (1997) and West (1999). The Indian experience is drawn fromvarious reports on pension reforms.24implemented pension reforms that seek either to introduce new pension schemes or tostrengthen the finances of existing schemes (e.g., in Indonesia). Public pension systems, if theyexist at all beyond the civil service, are typically restricted to the larger enterprises in the formalsector. Thus, overall public pension coverage of the labor force is still fairly limited andreplacement rates are low. Where such schemes exist, they are managed by public enterprises,and are financially not included in the central government budget. Private sector pensionsystems exist for the larger enterprises of some countries (notably China, Indonesia,Philippines, Thailand), and most of these are in the form of provident funds.There are few estimates of the impact of demographic trends on the pension outlays ofthe Asian economies. For those countries where pension coverage is relatively comprehensive,long-term actuarial projections are available for some of the pension schemes and theseindicate the financial pressures to which they may be subjected. In Korea, for example, actuarialprojections show the emergence of operating deficits in the National Pension Fund as early as2020 or sooner. For the provident fund-type schemes of Singapore and Malaysia, projectionssuggest that the ageing of the population will also result in a net draw down on fund reserves.To the extent that these funds are classified in the private sector, these draw downs would haveno impact on measured government fiscal balances (Heller, 1997).For other Asian Tigers, most of the public sector pension schemes cover only a limitedshare of the labour force. Thus, most long-term financial projections, where available, focus onthe demographics of the specific work process associated with particular pension schemes andon the terms of eligibility for benefits in these schemes. The few available financial projectionssuggest the exhaustion of built-up reserves within the next decade or so, and mounting6operating deficits threafter. In the absence of the governments being drawn into their financing,the deficits of these schemes would, in principle, need to be financed either by highercontribution rates from future workers or by cutbacks in benefits. Obviously, developments inthe size and demographic structure of the overall population are not useful for assessing thepotential pressures on public outlays from these pension schemes. Indeed, one may observeoperating deficits emerging in schemes, even where the overall demographic data for a countrywould not suggest any particular pressure in terms of rising overall elderly dependency rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                6 In China, the pressures begin to emerge in 2010, but become particularly severe after 2025; In Indonesia, the civilservice pension scheme begins to operate in deficit after 2006 (Asher 1997), and the pressures are furtherexacerbated by liabilities with respect to post-retirement health costs. In Korea, operating deficits emerge after 2020,25             An alternative perspective on the implications of demographic change can be gleanedby a simple assessment of the effect of an increase in the size of the elderly population rate ongross public pension outlays (Heller, 1997). In East Asia, through 2010, the effects ongovernment pension outlays are modest (1-2 percent of GDP), with the largest impact felt inKorea and Taiwan, and with far more limited effects in Singapore and Hong Kong, China.Outlays in Taiwan and Korea could also rise substantially, by about 4 per cent of GDP between2010 and 2025. By 2035, these expenditure shares could further increase, as the elderlydependency rate becomes larger. Indeed, by 2050, one could observe pension outlaysincreasing by 8-11 per cent of GDP in Korea and Taiwan relative to 1995 levels.In China, the budgetary effects only emerge between 2010 and 2025, but still remainmodest, with additional outlays of about 2 per cent of GDP between 1997 and 2025. Thereafter,however, demographic factors alone could increase government pension outlays by 5 per centof GDP by 2035. For the South East Asian Tigers, again the budgetary impact would benegligible for most countries (an increase under 1 per cent of GDP by 2025 and 2 per cent by2035), with the significant exception of Malaysia.The implications of enhancing pension coverageBeyond the obvious differences across countries as to when the elderly dependency ratewill become burdensome, the key factor determining the impact on outlays are differences in thescale of the government’s budgetary involvement in the pension sector. However, the statisticsalso implicitly suggest significant differences across economic groups within a country in termsof their claim on formal pension incomes during retirement. The populations not covered undersuch schemes are typically those in the informal and rural sectors who are almost wholly relianton intra-household transfers and savings. They are likely to be far more vulnerable to thefinancial risks of ageing.Were the governments of these countries to play a more active role in the pensionsphere in terms of ensuring some minimal pension to all uncovered elderly, government pensionoutlays could become more substantial. For example, if in 2025, the government were to pay apension equal to 30 per cent of per capita income to each elderly person not covered underexisting public pension schemes, then government pension outlays would rise significantly. InChina, a further increase in outlays of 1.7 per cent of GDP would be required as early as 2010,                                                                                                                                                                                                                ultimately eliminating the financial reserves that will have been accumulated. In Thailand, civil service pensiondeficits begin to emerge in 2020 and reserves have been projected to deplete by about 2027 (Heller, 1997).26and the pressure on pension outlays would become increasingly heavy. In South East Asia,outlays would be higher than in the previous projection by about 1-1.5 per cent of GDP by 2010,with further additional increase thereafter.Two broad sets of issues are clearly on the public policy agenda. First, where existingschemes for public enterprise employees and civil servants (e.g., in China, Indonesia, India,Thailand) have been shown to be actuarially in need of remedial financial measures, the issue iswhether the government will adapt these schemes to forestall such a situation or ultimatelyabsorb the cost of operating deficits.Second, and more important, are the problems posed by the ageing of the populations ofthe South East Asian Tigers and China, with reduced support ratios in terms of the number ofworkers relative to the elderly population, and an increasing breakdown of traditional extendedfamily support systems (particularly in the context of significant rural-urban migration anddeclining fertility rates). Will these societies decide to provide a more orgnaised financialframework for income support for the elderly than would emerge from voluntary householdsavings decisions and extended family support? To a significant extent, this is a distributionalquestion. The policy choices made in this regard will have both fiscal and macroeconomicimplications; both in the period before and after the elderly become an increasing share of thepopulation. The choices will also determine the way in which the financial pressures from anageing population are distributed within the societies.The Indian ScenarioThe case for fiscal consolidation in India is very strong given that the existing nominaldebt to GDP ratio is already very high compared to other emerging market economies. Theburden is further aggravated when unfunded pension liabilities, contingent liabilities,government guarantees of state enterprise debts, and the prospects of re-capitalisation of anumber of state owned financial institutions is taken into account. The combined fiscal deficithas been around 10 per cent of GDP in recent years. The challenge facing India therefore is arenewed focus on fiscal consolidation as is embedded in the objectives of the FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management Act that has been enacted recently.  As the fiscalchallenges arising from ageing will take some time to become evident, the opportunity ofstrengthening the fisc is new and needs to be pursued with great resolve.27An overview of the combined finances of the Central and State governments showssome improvement in 2003-04 on account of a lower growth rate in aggregate expenditure vis-à-vis non-debt receipts. The combined tax-GDP ratio registered an improvement of 0.5percentage points over the previous year’s level. Direct and Indirect taxes registeredimprovements over the previous year’s level; the improvement in direct taxes was, however,more pronounced as a proportion of GDP. There was also qualitative improvement inexpenditure composition in 2003-04 as reflected in a shift in favour of the developmentalcomponent. In terms of GDP, the development expenditure of the Centre and States exhibitedan improvement of one percentage point over the previous year. The share of capital outlay inthe total expenditure showed an improvement in 2003-04 by 2.6 percentage points.Containment of non-developmental expenditure was made possible through reductions ininterest payments on account of the softening of interest rates enabled by the conduct ofmonetary policy. The impact of the lower interest rates got reflected in the decline in the ratio ofinterest payments as a proportion of revenue receipts.India is undergoing the same forces of demographic transition that have beenexperienced in most other parts of the industrial and emerging market world, delayed by a fewdecades. Population will continue to grow in the next 50 years, albeit at a lower rate. The agestructure will change dramatically with a doubling of the share of ageing population. In fact,India’s population structure will, in 2050, mirror that presently found in the major industrialcountries.Fortunately, from, the fiscal point of view, unlike in industrial countries, India does nothave a “Beveridgean” social insurance system in place. Thus, India’s demographics do notnecessarily portend explosion in government social insurance outlays arising from underlyingexisting policy commitments. This being the case, the demographics still pose importantchallenges on social security for the government.India’s demographics have important ramifications for the approach taken to theprovision of medical care and the structure of India’s evolving social insurance policyframework. Although, they do not necessarily imply a dramatic expansion in the size of thegovernment health care system, the need for a substantial strengthening of both this systemand the regulatory framework in the sector cannot be over emphasised. Even without a nationalhealth insurance scheme, the level of primary care expenditure is grossly insufficient and wouldrequire at least a doubling of the share of this expenditure in GDP by 2010 (Heller, 2004).28Moreover, with an increasingly affluent population, the demand for medical care is expected torise sharply.Beyond the aggregate demographics of a country, the actuarial position of public andprivate pension schemes is primarily determined by a combination of the demographics of theinsured population of the scheme and the nature of the policy parameters of the particularpension scheme. In the case of India, only about 11 per cent of the current working agepopulation participate in mandatory, formal programmes designed to provide income securityduring old age. The participants in these schemes – salaried employees in the formal privatesector and government – are among the highest income groups in India. These schemes do notextend to nearly 85 per cent of workers in the informal sector who have little ability oropportunity to save for old age. The formal programmes consist of three funded programs, twoof which are of a defined-contribution nature (viz., the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) forformal private sector employees and the government-wide provident fund-the GovernmentProvident Fund) and one which is a defined-benefit scheme (the Employees’ Pension Scheme(EPS). There is also one unfunded programme – the Civil Servants Pension Scheme (CSPS),which is a non-contributory, pay-as-you-go pension system administered by both the central andstate governments. For two of the schemes, the CSPS and EPS, the government is likely toface significant long run contingent liabilities. The situation is difficult in the case of centralgovernment departments’ viz., defence and railways. The pension bill is estimated to be about25 per cent above the wage bill, which represents a hidden cost.Although, the EPS is, in principle, funded, it is unlikely that it is going to be financiallysustainable in the long run as its defined benefit promises too high a rate of return oncontributions. This rate of return is well beyond the feasible rate under the current restrictiveinvestment regulations and approximates the rate that can be expected from a well - diversifiedportfolio in the most advanced financial markets. Increasing coverage simply increases thenumber of the workers accruing unaffordable benefits. As interest income and lump sumwithdrawals from provident funds is tax exempt, tax preferences in the current pension systemadd to the strain on government finances.This problem is further compounded by administered interest rates on small savings,which are not in sync with market interest rates. While increasing attention was given by themonetary authority to explore alternative means of reducing the interest rate rigidities, sharpreductions in interest rates since 2001 following strong capital inflows raised concern about29protecting real interest income of retirees and pensioners, particularly in view of inadequatecoverage of social safety net in India. Therefore, while benchmarking of interest rates may bean interim solution, a medium term objective could be to design fully funded pension schemesover a period of time to be independently managed by professional trustees with returns linkedto the underlying assets of the Fund. In order to address the immediate concerns of savers, it isnecessary to limit the inter-year movement of interest rate fluctuations within tolerable levels. Infact, these concerns supersede the need for aligning the administered interest rates to marketrates. Further, it is also envisaged to offer a higher interest rate to Senior Citizen / Pensionersby benchmarking those securities with G-sec of longer tenor and adding a spread over thebenchmark (Government of India, 2004).A cursory review of India’s social insurance framework (Box 1) suggests enormousgaps, both in coverage and in the regulatory structure. Unemployment insurance basically doesnot exist, adding to the factors that have made it difficult for enterprises to rationalise workforces. In the health sector, most of the population is covered at best by a limited and poorlystaffed public health service. As a consequence, the bulk of health care is provided by theprivate sector. And finally, as discussed above, the various formal retirement savings schemescover no more than about 11 per cent of the labour force (Heller, 2004). Looking ahead, Indiawill need to develop a framework for provision of mechanisms for social insurance consistentwith a modern economy. While the private sector has to play an important part in extendingsocial security services, there has to be a dominant role of the public sector in both regulation ofthe private sector and in the targeting of the poorest groups. Box 1: OASIS (Old Age Social and Income Security)The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India had commissioneda national Project tilted “OASIS” (Old Age Social and Income Security) in 1999 to examinepolicy questions connected with old age income security in India and create necessaryinstitutional infrastructure and to make concrete recommendations for actions. The committee,which submitted its Report in February 1999, was entrusted with the twin task of furtherimproving existing provisions, and, to devise a new pension provision for excluded workers whoare not capable of saving even modest amounts and converting this saving into an old ageincome security provision. Major recommendations of the Committee were:30To develop an institutional infrastructure, through which individuals can prepare for old agewhile they are in the labour force, is an efficient pension system. As most individuals in India areoutside the organised sector and face temporary unemployment, a pension system for Indiashould thus be flexible and useful to the unorganized sector. Government dole is notsustainable on a significant scale and old age economic security should necessarily result fromsustained lifelong contributions by emphasizing self-help and thrift, and for sound pensionplanning, there should be sound fund management to achieve the highest possible rates ofreturn.The Committee recommended a simple and convenient pension system where a personopens a single Individual Retirement Account (IRA) at as early a point in his life as possible witha minimum of Rs.100 per contribution and Rs.500 in total accretions per year.  No limit on thefrequency of accretions or fixed monthly contribution.The pension system would work through a myriad Points of Presence (POPs), whichwould be located all over India including banks branches, post office etc; with full portabilityacross job changes/ and across geographical locations. It would be a two-tier system wherePOPs with good information technology and telecommunications facilities would offer betterservices than other technologically constrained POPs and in turn would reduce administrativeand transactions costs.Six professional pension fund managers (PFMs) should be selected to manage theretirement funds under this system.  The pension system would offer three styles - Safe Income,Balanced Income and Growth. Each of the six PFMs would run one scheme each in the threestyles, giving 18 schemes in all, which individuals can choose from.An additional safety net in the pension system is that if the final pension of a participant issmaller that the sum total of all contributions then the insurance cover would reimburse thisdifference for individuals who have contributed for at least ten years. To a significant extent, theGovernment can purchase this insurance from insurance companies.The design of the pension system should also include a Self Regulatory organization(SRO) that will be registered with the Indian Pension Authority. The pension system relies onannuity providers who convert the lump sum of assets (attained at retirement) into a regularmonthly pension (or a variable annuity) until death.31The tax-free limit for accretions into the IRA should continue to be a maximum ofRs.60,000 per annum.  Premature withdrawals as well as the terminal accumulations withdrawnas a lump sum from Provident Funds should be taxable at the rate of long-term capital gainsrate. However, the amount that is used for buying annuities should be tax-free.The income earned on Funds held in trust by PFM's and annuity providers, on behalf ofcontributors, should be exempt from any taxes.  There is a strong case for integrating a micro-credit facility into the pension system whereby individuals can have access to funds in the formof a loan against their pension savings.The enduring message for Asian countries, based on the experience of developedcountries, is that dependency and its concomitant fiscal impact is not necessarily towards oldage but also for the younger generation. While the expenditure on education can be funded byprivate provisions, that of health and medical care of older people are likely to come from publicspending on social security. Thus, ageing poses serious challenges on the fisc, which requireimmediate policy responses.  In this regard, public pension reforms and health insurance wouldplay a key role in alleviating the fiscal burden.V. Policy Response and Lessons from Developed CountriesPopulation ageing has many serious developmental linkages with a potential to jeopardizeeconomic and planning strategies. Normally, the subject is viewed as a problem in the very longrun; therefore, policy initiatives receive only peripheral attention. However, while addressing themagnitude and timing of the adverse demographic fallout, there is a need to reflect on the likelydirection and effects of critical policy choices in the social sectors, many of which initially haveonly a limited relationship with long run demographic pressures. These pressures later willeventually play an important role in determining longer-term fiscal effects. In reflecting on theoptions faced by the Asian countries, it is useful to look at the debate in industrialized countries,where the focus has largely been on three broad sets of options. These are:(1) Measures for fiscal consolidation in the period before the full impact of ageingcommences, thus improving the base level of national savings and public debt. Actions32to lower expenditures and raise primary budget surpluses in the non-age sensitive areasof budgets are clearly seen as strengthening this fiscal position.(2) Fundamental changes in policy design, particularly in the health and pensions sphere, inorder to contain the cost of the public sector’s social insurance commitment to theelderly population and to contain systemic cost-augmenting pressures in the medicalsector; and(3) Measures designed to at least partially redress the influence of demographic trends onthe workforce and thereby enhance growth rates and the government’s revenuepotential.The position of the Asian economies in the face of these choices of policy design in thekey social sector differs in some important respects. For the industrial countries, the scope forsignificant policy changes is restricted by the maturity of their pension and health systems andthe consequent difficulties of changing them. In contrast, the social service systems of many ofthe Asian countries are still in a formative stage. This is particularly true for India and China,where fundamental reforms to both the health insurance and pension systems are now underconsideration.There are both advantages and disadvantages in this situation. On the one hand, theproblem of ageing is a bit premature for many Asian economies (e.g., India, Pakistan,Bangladesh) while for some it is getting too late (e.g., Korea, China). There is need to ensurethat stable systems are put in place by the early part of this century but at the same time thesesystems have to be sufficiently flexible and moderate in their commitments on pension benefits.Secondly, in designing present policies, the longer term demographic developments have to beborne in mind although there may be more pressing fiscal problems at hand. Third, in view ofthe rapid pace of transformation of an ageing population, there is a need for policy makers toadequately modulate the speed of adjustment of reforms. Finally, although policy strategies arehighly reliant on private sector initiatives, the public sector has to play an important role inovercoming sources of market failure.Many of the issues that will confront public policy makers are essentially distributional incharacter e.g., should there be a minimal income level for the elderly and who should financesuch transfers. There has to be some reassessment of the generosity of some existing pensionschemes and measures to alleviate the gender bias inherent in some pension schemes. In the33area of medical care, policies have to address the issue whether access to medical care shouldbe governed by financial ability. Finally, the question of whether to broaden social securitycoverage beyond the formal sector to the informal economy, the rural sector, the foreignworkers communities will be a significant policy issue for most of the Asian countries during thenext few decades.In terms of allocation of scarce resources, expenditure within the social sectors need tobe prioritized to take account of the changing structure and level of demand in education andmedical sectors. While some levels of education need to see expansion others will needdownsizing. Similarly, medical facilities have to be upgraded which calls for heavy capitaloutlays.One issue that will influence social insurance system design is the capacity of thegovernment or the private sector to extend the administration of collections of payroll-relatedcontributions or taxes to the rural and urban informal sectors of the economy. The administrativecomplexity of taxing or realizing mandatory contributions from such groups will thus inevitablybias policy choices away from the notion of benefit systems that are tied to individualcontributions and more towards the provision of publicly financed services in the medical caresector and rough means-tested safety net transfers for the elderly. In effect, cross subsidizationfrom the general taxpayer to these groups, which are not an insignificant share of thepopulation, may be inevitable for the foreseeable future in Asia. This may reinforce the biastoward dualistic systems, which effectively differentiate between workers in the formal andinformal sectors. Allowing for optional participation in public pension and private or publicmedical insurance schemes is also an obvious option, but does not address the fundamentaldifficulty of limiting the extent to which there is a segmentation of the population in terms of thestandard at which pension and medical care needs are addressed.A second issue is whether the Asian countries need to alter their fiscal stance in light ofemerging demographic trends. In the pension sector, this would imply whether it would bedesirable to prefund higher outlays associated with pension as in Singapore and Malaysia or aswith Medisave in Singapore for medical care. Ultimately the question relates to whether a highernational savings rate is desirable, and the extent to this should be an explicit goal of policy. Thisis particularly true for East Asia where the aggregate and public sector savings rate are quitehigh and where even higher investment rates have fuelled higher economic growth and risingper capita income. For the less developed Tigers, the financial implications of ageing population34are less daunting for the foreseeable future. For these countries, achieving high rates of savingswould appear an important policy objective, but more so in order to achieve the rapid growthnecessary for raising per capita income levels. In effect, achieving rapid growth is one form of“prefunding”.Yet another issue is the availability of life insurance and private pension schemes inAsian countries. Asian countries, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, suffer from scarcity ofcapital, which restricts their capacity for large capital outlays in infrastructure.  Pooled savings ofpension and insurance schemes can be channelised for productive investments therebyincreasing the potential for higher growth. Higher growth would enable higher investments insocial security, as the scope of additional mobilisation of resources through higher taxes islimited. These measures would facilitate the burden of an ageing population without inhibitingthe development process while maintaining inter-generational equity.  In order to postpone the burden of pension funding, another policy option may be toincrease the retirement age for existing employees (e.g., Japan) thereby keeping elderly peopleemployed for a longer period. In this regard, incentive schemes for early retirement may bewithdrawn or discontinued. However, while this may be a feasible solution in developedcountries with low growth rates of population, such measures in Asian countries, experiencinghigh population growth, would result in increased unemployment, as more job seekers wouldremain unemployed for a longer duration.35Pension ReformsIn the context of growing pension liabilities, several countries have initiated modificationsin the civil service pension schemes. Many countries have, accordingly, taken measures toreduce the pension liabilities by introducing higher retirement ages and /or longer serviceperiods; increasing required employee contribution rates; lowering rates of benefit accrual; andchanging the post retirement indexation policy. Illustratively, Korea has increased the employeeshare of contribution, shifted from wage to price indexation, and reduced the benefit levels tonew employees. Italy also shifted from wage to price indexation and introduced limitations onearly retirement. Brazil, Greece and Portugal have also reduced the benefit accrual rates. Anumber of countries have also realised the need to achieve some level of advance funding ofbenefit obligations.Pension reforms being undertaken by various countries follow different forms. The multi-pillar system adopted in several countries consists of an unfunded mandatory pillar, a fundedmandatory pillar, and a voluntary private pillar. The design of the pillars has varied across thecountries. There are, however, three major types of pension reforms across the world. At theone end of the spectrum is the Latin American (individual account) model, with only one DCpillar established by Chile in 1980 and now followed by Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia andUruguay. While the other two models are the OECD (employer sponsored) model adopted byAustralia, Switzerland, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, and the notional defined contribution(NDC) system which originated in Sweden and adopted in Italy, Latvia and Poland.Given the wide variety of demographic experience in Asia, the sequencing of pensionreforms has to be in sync with the changing profile of dependency ratio while addressing thefiscal challenges and this needs to be seen from an overall perspective. In this regard, pensionreform in two Asian countries viz. India and China is discussed briefly.IndiaIn India, initiatives towards pension reforms have been somewhat nascent at both theCentral and State Government level (Box 2 & 3).Box 2: New Pension System for the Central Government of India36In February 2002, the High Level Expert Group on New Pension System submitted itsreport suggesting modifications in the pension system for Central Government employees. InAugust 2003, the Union Government approved the proposal to implement the budgetannouncement of 2003-04 relating to the introduction of a new restructured defined contributorypension system for new entrants to Central Government services, except to Armed Forces. Anindependent Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority have also been set up toregulate and develop the pension market.It is important to note that pension schemes for Government employees in India are non-contributory and unfunded. As such, these are to be met through Government’s currentrevenues. Traditional fiscal indicators based on cash flow accounting do not capture theimplications of pension liabilities. Hence, size of the debt based cash flow deficit does not fullyreflect Government’s liabilities. Any realistic assessment of the fiscal situation would also needto address the issue of pension liabilities.In the context of the new contributory pension scheme for Central Governmentemployees, an important issue is funding of existing pension liabilities and pension fundmanagement. The pension reforms announced for the Central Government employees will yieldpositive returns only in the long run. During the transitional period, the burden on theGovernment finances will in fact increase as the Government will have to contribute to thepension fund as also meet the pension liabilities of the existing employees and pensioners. Thiscalls for some funding arrangement for existing employees as well. Appropriate regulatoryframework for pension fund management is another important aspect crucial for enhancing thecredibility of the funded pension schemes.  Box 3: Pension Liabilities of the State Governments in IndiaAt the State Government level, the issue of increasing pension liabilities has alsoassumed critical importance since their unfunded and non-contributory nature has proved to bea mounting burden on the State budgets. So far, however, only a few State Governments haveinitiated measures towards the introduction of a contributory pension scheme.  A Group to Studythe Pension Liabilities of the State Governments submitted its report in February 2003, whichwas published in February 2004.37 Some of the major recommendations of the Group are: Introduction of contributorypension scheme/s which should be mandatory for all new employees of the State Governmentsin place of the existing non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme. The recommendedalternative pension models are:(i) Pure Defined Contribution (DC) Scheme in which the new employees and theGovernment each would contribute 10 per cent of the basic pay and dearness allowance to anindividual account. The contributions will be vested in a Fund, which will be invested inaccordance with specified guidelines. The employee at the time of retirement will get an amountwhich will be the aggregate total of the employee’s contribution, Government’s (employer’s)contribution and the earnings (on investment made by the Fund) attributed to the employee’sAccount;(ii) A Defined Contribution –Defined Benefit (DC-DB) Scheme- a contributory schemewith guarantee of an appropriate level of pension fixed by individual State Governments; and(iii) A Two-Tier Scheme (i.e. a DC-DB Scheme plus a second tier of DC Scheme) - thedefined benefit in the first Tier of DC-DB scheme could be reduced from the present level of 50per cent to an appropriate level of say 30 per cent and supplemented by a mandatory DCscheme, wherein both the employees and the State Governments make contributions.To have some immediate and medium-term effect on State finances, a few parametricchanges in the current pension scheme for both the existing employees and pensioners becomeinevitable. These include immediate withdrawal of fixing of pensions on the basis of only lastone month’s pay, wherever applicable, eliminating wage indexation, wherever applicable; andmaximum permissible commutation amount to be brought down from 40 per cent of BasicPension to 33 1/3 per cent (1/3rd).In order to at least partially meet the pension burden of the existing employees andpensioners, there is a need for setting up a “Dedicated Pension Fund" through levying a cess on/collecting contributions from all the existing employees, retaining a portion of increased salaryand dearness allowance (DA) arising from the revisions in salary and DA, and taking steps toaugment the Fund.China38Old-age security is one of the first components of the social security system in China tobe selected for reform. Originally, China’s social security system was designed to deliver manyof the social services and benefits to the population through state-owned enterprises. In theprocess of reform of the social security system, government has made clear the need to shiftresponsibility for providing social services and benefits from enterprises to a combination of thegovernment, enterprises, community, and individuals.The weaknesses and limitations of the old-age pension system established in the 1950sbecame apparent as China shifted towards a market-oriented economy in the early 1980s. Theenterprise-based system was increasingly unable to meet present obligations, and pay-as-you-go financing clearly would be unsuitable to meet the challenge of the next century with anageing population. Various reforms of the pension system were underway on a trial basis in anumber of cities by the mid-1980s. Pension reform gained momentum in the early 1990s whenexperiments became more widespread, and social security reform began to focus on expandedcoverage and uniformity in design details.China has taken rapid strides in laying the foundation for a more stable old age securitysystem. The new system includes multiple pillars, although attention thus far has focused on thesocial or public pillar. The financing burden is being shared by employees, employers, and thegovernment rather than being borne exclusively by the individual work unit. The framework is inplace for a defined contribution plan, which can become funded, and a defined benefit plan,which may remain pay-as-you-go. Also, pensions are being indexed to control the erosion ofpension value by inflation.Pension reform is incomplete, however, and a number of important issues remain to betackled. It is critical that regulations and supervision catch up with the new system. Contributorsand beneficiaries alike need to be assured that funds are properly managed. In addition, ifpension reform is to be successful, it is imperative that state-owned enterprise reform proceeds.There are many aspects to state-owned enterprise reform, including the establishment ofunemployment insurance, housing reform, and a determination of how to value and sell off stateassets while preserving a portion of assets from bankrupt enterprises to cover pensionobligations. Delay in completing state-owned enterprise reform runs the risk of the reformedpension system unraveling if the current need to bail out state-owned enterprises and excusetheir pension contributions continues indefinitely.39Growing pension liabilities, globally, have resulted in significant reforms in pensionschemes. Measures include the introduction of higher retirement ages; increased employeecontribution rates; lowering benefit accrual rates; and changing the post retirement indexationpolicy. A number of countries have also realised the need to achieve some level of advancefunding of benefit obligations.  In Asia, pension reforms can be characterised as diverse,ranging from the advanced modern systems as prevalent in Singapore, Korea and Malaysia tothe relatively less advanced systems in most other countries. In this regard, medical and healthinsurance are quite comprehensive in the East Asian countries. China and India has onlyrecently embarked on the path of pension reforms although the coverage is still confined to theorganised sector. Medical Insurance continues to be based on private funding in India. Pensionschemes has got to be from both the public and private sector and, in this context, thedevelopment of robust debt markets, in particular, and financial markets, in general, is anecessary prerequisite which would facilitate the mobilisation and channelling of savings in highreturn yielding assets. This, in turn, would make pension funds viable and capable ofwithstanding the economic pressures of population ageing.VI. Approach to Asian AgeingAs in other parts of the world, Asia is also undergoing rapid ageing of its population as aresult of much increased longevity in the lives of most people.  The emerging process will besimilar to that being observed in developed countries already, but the onset of fiscal pressureswill perhaps be delayed by 25 to 50 years in different Asian countries.  The existence of a largeproportion of rural farm based populations, lower life expectancy and the tradition of familysupport systems has so far masked the problems of ageing in Asian countries.  With increasingurbanization, life expectancy, and breakdown of family support systems, the pressures for publicfunding for health care and support of the aged are bound to increase in Asia in the years tocome.Among the key differences with the developed world are• ageing is taking place at much lower income levels and hence capacity to fund socialwelfare is lower.• There continue to be huge demands for funding of both physical and social infrastructurein growing Asian economies.40• Some countries have constrained fiscal situations.Our key advantage in Asia is that we know the future : we can see it in the emergingdemographic challenges of the developed countries.  What then are the lessons for us :• Do active fiscal consolidation before these new fiscal challenges emerge.• Pay serious attention to policy design for both health care and pension/socialsecurity systems.   As for as possible, reduce the weight of defined benefit pensionsystems and move towards fully funded systems, or a judicious fiscally responsiblecombination of the two.  In the case of health, with vaulting technology, it is essential tokeep a strict watch on health costs, and to design sustainable health insurance systemswith an eye to future ageing related liabilities.• Pay attention to policy implications of ageing:  A key component of this is to slowdown the shift from private to public provision of both social security and health care.Serious thought can be given to appropriate incentive mechanisms that encouragefamily provision caring of the aged.  Social security systems in Asia are at a formativestage and care can be taken to not go the way of developed countries in terms ofuniversal public coverage.• Provide for flexibility: Although the demographic future is relatively clear, unexpectedeconomic and other changes do take place.  Thus, there is great need for building inflexibility in policy design in terms of social security expenditure.  As the totaldependency ratio is not projected to increase, the gradual transformation to an ageingpopulation would imply a shift in social security expenditure pattern from education tohealth care and pensions.  While expenditure on medical and health care would be a mixof public and private expenditure, that on education may have a greater component ofprivate provision.  Thus, policy design will need to look ahead at the pattern ofdemographic change in a detailed manner to provide for flexibility in the public/privatecomponents of potential social expenditures.• Focus on those who cannot help themselves: In view of the relatively lower levels ofincomes in Asian countries and fiscal constraints, more care can be taken on focusingpublic social expenditures on the relatively less well off, and avoid the perils of universal41applicability of social security.  This would clearly imply a measure of incomeredistribution : how much is feasible without significant impact on savings and workbehaviour?There are a number of positive features in the current Asian economic scenario that canmitigate the expected fiscal challenges of ageing. Let me turn to some of them.Role of Migration and RemittancesRemittances play a critical social insurance role - and this has significant impact on bothpoverty and equity (Kapur, 2003).  Remittances for some Asian countries, especially for South-Asia, are very high constituting about 63 per cent of total net inflows.  Remittances financeconsumption, land and housing purchases and philanthropy and they are an important soruce ofsocial insurance in lower income countries.  The effects of remittances are complex and are afunction of the characteristics of migrants and the households they leave behind, theirmotivations, and the overall economic environment.  In Asian countries, particularly in the Indiansub-continent, remittances are a steady source of resources at low-income levels, which areinvariant to market conditions.  As such, these flows seem to be unaffected by changes ininterest rates, country ratings, etc.Projections show that the median age of developed countries would be about 46 yearsaround 2050.  This is indicative of an ageing population which is clearly unsustainable from thepoint of working age population.  One solution for lowering the fiscal burden would be either byencouraging large-scale migration or increases in existing birth rates.  Historical evidence,however, does not support the possibility of higher fertility once fertility dips below replacementlevel.  Migration would facilitate the problem of ageing in both the developed countries and thepoorer ones.  In developed countries, it would add to the younger workforce thereby increasingproductivity, generate higher tax revenues and social security contributions.  On the other hand,continuous flow of remittances from migrant workers would add to the private provisionssupporting the old thereby reducing the fiscal burden of both the countries.  It may be noted thatIndia and the Philippines have recorded relatively high remittances during the last decade,which are now in excess of 3 per cent of GDP of these countries.Thus migration has to be part of the ageing story.  It is good for recipient countries,reducing dependency ratios, increases tax resources and increasing growth.42It is good for sending countries, reducing the pressure for job generation; a good sourceof funding for family retention of the old; and good for on the job training.Economic GrowthUnlike developed countries, where economic growth is now constrained by the limits toproductivity growth, Asian countries will continue to exhibit high rates of growth for some time tocome.  First, as incomes grow, India, Indonesia, and others will continue to exhibit high savingsrates.  Second, as latecomers, technology adoption is cheap; productivity improvement andconsequent economic growth can occur at a fast pace.  But third, to get these benefits,employment generation is essential and a key problem for policy design.  However, it iscontinued high economic growth and savings rates that can do much to enable Asian countriesto provide for the fiscal challenges that will emerge from ageing.Financial MarketsIf we are to avoid the trap of public provision of welfare except for the needy, thedevelopment of a healthy privately funded system will depend crucially on the adequatedevelopment of financial markets.  As financial savings increase and health, insurance andpension funds are to provide adequate returns, they need to be invested in productive activitiesproviding adequate returns.The first need is the maintenance of prudent macroeconomic management,accompanied by monetary stability, with low and stable inflation.  Second, confidence in equitymarkets needs to be developed. Hence there is a need for continued improvements inregulation. Third, bond market development is in its infancy in Asia.  This needs to be nurturedand developed consciously to provide adequate depth and breadth for fixed income instrumentsnecessary for investment of social security funds.InfrastructureWe have great opportunities in this direction for the efficient intermediation of funds forproductive uses.  The 21st century is Asia's urban century.  Large resources will continue to beneeded for different segments of infrastructure : urban infrastructure, particularly water,43sanitation, sewerage; power; ports, airports, railways, roads and the like.  The telecom sectorhas provided an example of private funding of infrastructure where appropriate financial returncan lead to large and rapid investment.  The levy and collection of appropriate user charges isessential and a certain degree of financial engineering, including public partnership, is requiredfor providing adequate and relatively large returns.The current availability of high savings in Asian countries can therefore be married to thedevelopment of adequate financial and capital markets to avoid the potential fiscal challenges ofageing in Asia.Low and sustainable inflation is key to macroeconomic stability.  Monetary authorities, byemphasizing price stability can anchor inflation expectations, thereby facilitating the emergenceof a smooth term structure of interest rates.  This would not only strengthen monetary and fiscalcoordination but also develop the debt market.  Thus, the enduring message for the Asiancountries is that they ought to adopt an integrated policy framework on population ageingcovering demographic transition and reforms in the fiscal and financial sectors.In conclusion,• Asian countries have the advantage of seeing what is happening in the West.• We can avoid the follies of excessive social welfare states• We need to develop funded health and pension schemes• We need to consciously delay the shift from private welfare provision to public welfareprovision• The indications are that we will probably succeed.44 ReferencesAaron, H.

InBirdsall, N. et al. Population matters, Oxford University Press.AnnexConcepts and MeasuresConceptually, population ageing is different from individual ageing. Individual ageing is acontinuous process; a person ages inexorably from the time of birth to the moment of death,whatever the form of the life cycle or stages. Populations, however, can become older oryounger depending on the age structure composition of the people. The age of a population canbe determined in several ways. Although proportions of those aged sixty years and above aregenerally used as an index of ageing, there are several other measures of ageing each havingit’s own advantages and disadvantages. Broadly, however, these are categorised as traditionaland alternative measures that are discussed, in brief, in the following paragraphs. The varioustraditional measures of population ageing which are frequently used are (i) the proportions ofpersons aged 60 or 65 years and above, (b) mean age, (c) median age, (d) proportion ofchildren under 15 years of age and (e) age- child ratio. Among these, the most commonly used measure is the proportions of aged 60 or 65years and above due to its simplicity and easy comprehensibility. This statistic measures ageingthrough the proportion of people aged 60 (or 65) and above in the total population. A populationis said to be ageing when the proportion of people aged 65 plus is rising. According to theUnited Nations, a share of 7 per cent is enough to make the population aged. Usually, the UNhas recommended the age of 60 as the age marking the onset of ageing. The second measure,47the mean age of a population has been defined as the number of persons in each age group,which, though theoretically useful, has not been of much use. Third, the median age has beendefined as the exact age that divides the age distribution in two equal halves. A typical ageingpopulation has its median age at 30 years or more. When the median age varies between 20and 29 years, a country is in the intermediate stage of the ageing process while a median agebelow 20 years indicates a young population.  Fourth measure is the proportion of childrenunder 15 years of age to the total population. Any proportion below 30 is typically regarded asold. By this measure, India is projected to reach such a level by 2010. Finally, the ratio of thenumber of elderly persons to the number of children, called the Ageing Index, is the fifthmeasure that takes into account the size and changes at both ends of the age distribution. Bythis measure, a value of over 30 indicates an ageing population.Beside the traditional measures, there are other dependency measures of ageing. Thesemeasures are not used for measuring the ageing of population per se, but have been used asan approximation of the social and economic dependency created by the ageing of populations.Various forms of this measure are: (i) old age dependency ratio, (ii) potential support ratio, (iii)parent support ratio, (iv) youth dependency ratio and (v) total dependency ratio. The old agedependency ratio is the ratio of those aged 65 years and above to those aged between 15 and64 years of age. The potential support ratio is defined as the number of persons aged 15-64years per every person aged 65 years or older. The parent support ratio is defined as thenumber of persons aged 85 years and above per 100 persons in the age bracket 50-64 years.The youth dependency ratio is defined as the number of persons aged 0 to 14 years per 100persons in the age group of 15 to 64 years. Finally, the total dependency ratio is the number ofpersons under age 15 plus persons aged 65 or older per one hundred persons aged 15 to 64.In contrast to these traditional measures, there are other alternative measures that havebeen discussed in the theoretical literature. These are (i) Ryder’s alternative measure, (ii) P-Index of Ageing and (iii) Slope of the Population Pyramid.  The first one proposed an alternativemeasure by designating the entry into old age in terms of the number of years remaining untildeath. Accordingly, old age is considered the last 10 years of life. Under this criterion, thepopulation of aged is the proportion of people above the age corresponding to a life expectancyof 10 years. Second, the P-Index of ageing has been suggested to introduce more refinementsin ageing estimation based on Sen’s P-Index of Poverty, which takes into account bothproportion of aged and extent of oldness. Finally, the slope of the population pyramid has also48been used as a single summary index of population ageing. As the slope becomes steeper, thepopulation is said to be ageing. Despite the availability of various alternative measures, thetraditional measure of proportion of aged population has been most commonly used in theliterature due to several reasons. First, while it is a convenient measure for calculation, thistechnique is easily comprehensible. Additionally, the internationally comparable ageing data(e.g. UN data) for most countries is based on this method.******49
