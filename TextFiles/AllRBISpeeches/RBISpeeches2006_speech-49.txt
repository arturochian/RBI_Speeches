Reforms, Productivity and Efficiency in Banking:The Indian Experience*Rakesh MohanLet me at the outset congratulate the Pakistan Society of DevelopmentEconomists for organising this Conference. Issues of productivity and efficiency havebeen at the centre-stage of discussions in recent years. Nowhere is this truer than thefinancial sector, which is perceived to be the ‘brain’ of the economy (Stiglitz, 1998). Evenwithin the financial sector, given the dominance of bank-based financial systems in mostemerging markets including ours and the systemic importance of banks in the financialsystem, the banking sector continues to be the centre of attention for academia andpolicymakers alike. Not surprisingly therefore, performance of the banking sector hasrepercussions across the length and breadth of the economy. Judged thus, the theme ofthe Conference immediately appealed to me in view of its topicality and timeliness. As acentral banker, the obvious topic for me to speak on relates to productivity and efficiencyin Indian banking.The objective of reforms in general is to accelerate the growth momentum of theeconomy, defined in terms of per capita income. Typically, improvements in the growthrate can be effected through three, not necessarily mutually exclusive channels:improving productivity of capital, through investments in human capital and raising totalfactor productivity (TFP).The quality of functioning of the financial sector can be expected to affect thefunctioning and productivity of all sectors of the economy. Efficient financialintermediation should help in improving economy-wide resource allocation therebypromoting productivity growth all round.  Thus discussion on economic efficiency andproductivity should involve analysis of developments in the financial sector.Improvements in the financing of physical and human capital, both in terms of increasingmagnitudes, and in terms of allocative efficiency, should raise efficiency and productivityacross the economy.  This approach justifies the choice of my topic today.Financial intermediation is essential to the promotion of both extensive andintensive growth.  The efficient intermediation of funds from savers to users enables theapplication of available resources to their most productive uses. The more efficient afinancial system is in such resource generation and in its allocation, the greater is itscontribution to productivity and economic growth.  As resource allocation improves andreal returns increase, savings would presumably respond and higher resourcegeneration should result.  Thus, development of the financial system is essential to thegeneration of higher productivity and economic growth. I will structure my address along the following lines. First, I will explore in briefthe impact of banking sector productivity on the rest of the economy. This is relevant inview of the fact that any discussion on productivity and efficiency issues in bankingwould need to be judged in conjunction with the level of financial development and other                                                * st Address Delivered at the 21 Annual General Meeting and Conference of the Pakistan Societyof Development Economists at Islamabad in December 2005.

This will be followed by a brief review of banking sectorreforms in India. The subsequent section will examine, in some detail, the trends inproductivity and efficiency in Indian banking. My concluding remarks will be in the natureof the way ahead on areas germane to this sector at the present juncture.2. How does productivity in banking influence the rest of the economy?Economic history provides support for the fact that financial development makesa fundamental contribution to growth. Financial development helped in the promotion ofindustrialisation in developed countries by facilitating the mobilisation of capital for largeinvestments. Well-functioning banks or other financial intermediaries such as venturecapital funds also spur technological innovation by identifying and funding entrepreneurswho are perceived to have the best chances of developing new products successfullyand for implementing innovative production processes.Recent research has provided robust evidence supporting the view that financialdevelopment contributes to economic growth.• At the cross-country level, various measures of financial development (includingmeasures of financial sector assets, domestic credit to private sectors and stockmarket capitalization) are found to be positively related to economic growth.• Other studies establish a positive relationship between financial developmentand growth at the industry level (Rajan and Zingales, 1998).• Similarly, at the firm level, firms in countries with deeper financial developmentare able to obtain more external funds and thereby enabled to grow faster(Demirgúc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1998).A basic indicator of financial development is the contribution of finance-relatedactivities to GDP. The share of real GDP originating from finance-related activities inIndia tripled from just around 2 per cent during the 1970s to around 6 per cent during the1990s and further to 7 per cent during the first half of this decade. Within the servicessector, the share of finance rose from less than 5 per cent to more than 12 per cent overthe same period (Table 1).Table 1: Share of Real GDP originating in Banking and Insurance(per cent)Period Share of banking and Share of banking andinsurance in GDP insurance in services1970-71 to 1974-75 1.8 4.61975-76 to 1979-80 2.2 5.41980-81 to 1984-85 2.5 5.91985-86 to 1992-93 3.9 8.51993-94 to 1998-99 5.8 11.81999-2000 to 2003-04 6.7 12.3Source: Computed from National Accounts Statistics, Central Statistical Organisation.3The broad-based indicators of financial development, as culled from the flow-of-funds accounts, are also testimony to gradual widening and deepening of the economy.Most of the commonly tracked ratios exhibited an upward trend during the 1970s and1980s, while moderate fluctuations in these ratios were observed during the 1990s(Table 2). What is of interest is that the Finance Ratio, a proxy for financial deepening,witnessed remarkable improvement over this period.Table 2: Flow of Funds-based Indicators of Financial DevelopmentPeriod FR FIR NIR IR1970-71 to 1974-75 0.2 1.4 0.8 0.81975-76 to 1979-80 0.3 1.8 1.0 0.71980-81 to 1984-85 0.3 2.4 1.4 0.71985-86 to 1989-90 0.4 2.4 1.4 0.71991-92 0.5 2.9 1.6 0.81994-95 0.5 2.4 1.2 0.91995-96 0.5 2.3 1.3 0.7FR = Finance ratio =Total issues/National income (net national product at current prices)FIR = Financial inter-relations ratio =Total issues/net domestic capital formationNIR = New issue ratio = Primary issues/ net domestic capital formationIR = Inter-relations ratio = secondary issues (i.e., issues by banks and other financial1institutions)/primary issuesSource: Reserve Bank of IndiaWhen we move away from these broad-based indicators to more specificliquidity- and credit-based indicators, a similar picture emerges. Illustratively, the ratio ofaggregate deposits to GDP exceeded 50 per cent during the first half of the currentdecade; M3/GDP has averaged around 50 per cent since the 1990s. At a slightly moredisaggregated level, while bank credit to government has witnessed some tapering off inthe second half of the 1990s, credit to the commercial sector averaged over 30 per centof GDP during the first half of the current decade (Table 3). These observations areparticularly relevant from the standpoint of the role of banks in the intermediationprocess. Juxtaposed with the financial sector reforms, this suggests that the enhancedfreedom of banks since the liberalisation process has provided them with the flexibility inresource mobilisation and deployment, which has manifested itself in the uptrend inthese ratios. Thus financial deepening has been taking place continuously in India and isstill in progress.                                                1 By issues we mean 'sources of funds' or 'financial liability' of the sectors.Secondary issues refer to issues by financial intermediaries (i.e. banks and other financialinstitutions).Therefore, secondary issues = sources of funds of banking sector + sources of funds of otherfinancial sector.Primary issues refer to issues by all sectors other than financial intermediaries.Finance Ratio (FR) captures the relationship between financial development and overalleconomic growth.The relationship between financial development and the growth of physical investment iscaptured by the Financial Inter-relations Ratio (FIR)The New Issue Ratio (NIR) reflects the proportion of primary claims issued by non-financialinstitutionsInter-relations Ratio (IR) captures the relative importance of financial institutions in financialtransactions (Source: Rangarajan and Jadhav, 1992).4Table 3: Liquidity - and Credit-based Indicators of Financial Development(as per cent of GDP at current market prices)Period Aggregate M3 Bank credit to Bank credit todeposits Government commercial sector1970-71 to 1974-75 16.4 25.9 13.3 15.61975-76 to 1979-80 24.1 33.0 14.0 21.81980-81 to 1984-85 30.0 39.1 18.7 26.91985-86 to 1989-90 36.1 45.4 22.9 30.31990-91 to 1994-95 39.6 49.3 23.6 29.01995-96 to 1999-00 43.8 53.8 21.9 28.62000-01 to 2004-05 54.7 65.3 24.9 33.5Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaStudies by the Reserve Bank (RBI, 2000) on the association between financeand growth for an extended time span from 1971-72 to 1999-2000 find that the causalitybetween finance (proxied by real M3 growth) and growth (proxied by real GDP growth) isbi-directional. However, in the absence of any structural model underlying suchrelationships, these ‘causality’ estimates can only be interpreted in terms of thepredictive content of each of the variables. Subsequent research on the inter-linkagebetween finance and growth in India has veered around to the view that the Indiangrowth process has essentially been ‘finance-led’: expansion in the financial sectorplayed an enabling role in promoting capital accumulation, which, in turn, engenderedhigher growth (Bell and Rousseau, 2001). Typically however, studies of this genre tendto be susceptible to the time period and choice of variables, so that a different periodwith another set of variables could possibly lead to different conclusions. What is,however, accepted is that finance did play a role in influencing the growth process inIndia, although such observations related to financial deepening have little to say aboutefficiency and productivity growth.The aforesaid observations do not take into account the changing dynamics ofthe financial system. The traditional classification of the financial system as bank- ormarket-based often tends to be static; in contrast, financial systems evolve and developover time in response to changes in the institutional environment, legal set up and othercountry-specific features. This has been the case in India as well. Many of you would beaware that, cross-country classifications of financial system have typically classifiedIndia as a ‘bank-based’ system. This is not surprising, since banks have traditionallybeen the dominant financial intermediaries. However, the relative share of banks in totalfinancial sector assets, which was nearly three-fourths in the early 1980s, came downgradually over a period of time and has hovered around the two-thirds mark since the1990s (Ray & Sengupta, 2004).More importantly however, following the rapid growth of stock markets since the1990s, the role of ‘market-based’ finance has been on the rise. The most commonlyemployed measure of financial system orientation – the ratio of market capitalisation tobank assets - supports this observation (Table 4). This suggests that not only havefinancial institutions gained in terms of financial assets, but there is also considerablepotential for market financing to develop. However, the magnitude of marketcapitalisation is obviously dependent on the vagaries of the stock market: it is notexpected to exhibit a consistent increase as a ratio of GDP, whereas the growth in bankassets/GDP ratio is much more regular.5Table 4: Financial System Orientation(as per cent of GDP at current market prices)As at end Assets of scheduled Market capitalisation Financial systemcommercial banks at BSE orientation(1) (2) (3) (4)=(3)/(2)x100December 1970 17.9 3.8 21.3December 1975 21.0 2.6 11.0December 1980 40.0 3.8 9.3December 1985 46.8 7.4 15.2March 1991 56.3 16.0 28.4March 1995 51.6 43.1 83.5March 2000 59.1 46.8 79.3March 2003 69.0 23.2 33.7March 2004 71.6 43.5 60.8March 2005 75.9 54.7 72.1BSE: The National Stock Exchange, MumbaiSource: Computed from Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBIWhereas financial deepening is easier to measure, analysing productivity andefficiency changes in banking is more complex and needs to be viewed in relation to thechanging contours of the banking industry in India.23. Contours of Indian Banking Sector ReformsThe transformation of the banking sector in India needs to be viewed in light ofthe overall economic reforms process along with the rapid changes that have beentaking place in the global environment within which banks operate. The global forces ofchange include technological innovation, the deregulation of financial servicesinternationally, our own increasing exposure to international competition and, equallyimportant, changes in corporate behaviour such as growing disintermediation andincreasing emphasis on shareholder value. Recent banking crises in Asia, Latin Americaand elsewhere have accentuated these pressures.As many of you would be aware, India embarked on a strategy of economicreforms in the wake of a serious balance-of-payments crisis in 1991; a central plank ofthe reforms was reform in the financial sector and, with banks being the mainstay offinancial intermediation, the banking sector. The objective of the banking sector reformswas to promote a diversified, efficient and competitive financial system with the ultimateobjective of improving the allocative efficiency of resources through operational flexibility,improved financial viability and institutional strengthening. A summary profile of thebanking industry over the last 15 years is presented in Table 5.                                                2 I have discussed the details of financial sector reforms in India elsewhere; see Mohan (2005).6Table 5: Summary Profile of the Banking Industry: 1990-91 to 2004-05Year/Bank Group 1990-91 1995-96 2004-05PSB Private Foreign PSB Private Foreign PSB Private Foreign1.

Thus, although a great degree of financial deepening had indeed takenplace and financial savings had increased continuously, financial markets were not reallyfunctioning, and there was little price discovery in terms of the cost of money, i.e.,interest rates.  The efficiency and productivity enhancing function of the financial systemwas severely handicapped.  Hence, a widespread financial sector reform effort has beenunderway since 1991.3Let me briefly sum up the major areas of banking sector reforms :• Financial repression through statutory pre-emptions has been reduced, whilestepping up prudential regulations at the same time.• Interest rates have been progressively deregulated on both the deposit andlending sides (Box I).Restoration of the health of the banking system has involved:• Restoration of public sector banks' net worth achieved throughrecapitalisation where needed (total cost less than one per cent of GDP).• Competition increased through entry of new private sector banks and foreignbanks.• Higher levels and standards of disclosure achieved to enhance markettransparency.• Bank regulation and supervision strengthened towards international bestpractice.• Micro prudential measures instituted.                                                3  A detailed discussion on this aspect is contained in Bhide et al. (2001).7• Supervision process streamlined with combination of on-site and off-sitesurveillance along with external auditing.• Risk based supervision introduced.• Process of structured and discretionary intervention introduced for problembanks through a prompt corrective action mechanism.• Ownership of public sector banks has been broadened through disinvestmentup to 49 per cent, and banks have been listed (Table 6).• Mechanism for greater regulatory coordination instituted for regulation andsupervision of financial conglomerates.• Measures taken to strengthen creditor rights (still in process).Box IInterest Rate DeregulationDeposit Rate Deregulation April 1992: (a) interest rates freed between 46 days and 3 years and over, butceiling prescribed, (b) October 1995 : Ceiling removed for deposits over 2 years July 1996: Ceiling removed for deposits over 1 year October 1997: Interest Rates on Term Deposits Completely Deregulated 2004: Minimum maturity for term deposits reduced to 7 daysLending Rate Deregulation 1992-93: Six categories of lending rateso 5 slabs for below Rs.2 lakho Minimum lending rate above Rs.2 lakh October 1994: Lending Rate freed for Loans above Rs.2 lakh & Minimum RateAbolished October 1996: Banks to specify maximum spread over PLR 1997-98: Separate PLRs permitted for cash credit/demand loans and term loansabove 3 years.

For instance, despite thegradual tightening of prudential norms, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) to totalloans, which was at a high of 15.7 per cent for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) atend-March 1997, has declined by more than two thirds to 5.2 per cent at end-March2005 (Table 7). Net NPLs also witnessed a significant decline, driven by theimprovements in loan loss provisioning and improved recovery management, whichcomprises over half of the total provisions and contingencies. Capital adequacy of thebanking sector also recorded a marked improvement and reached 12.8 per cent at end-March 2005, well above the stipulated level of 9 per cent. Banks have also beensensitised to develop robust risk management systems for credit and operational risksand focus on their asset-liability maturity profile to withstand adverse movements inmarket risk parameters such as interest rates and take corrective measures.Table 7: Non-performing Loans of Different Bank Groups: 1994-2005(per cent to total advances)Year PSB Old Private New Private Foreign Memo: NPL/total loans(end-March) Banks Banks Banks (per cent) - 20041994 24.8 NC NC NC China: 15.61995 19.5 NC NC NC Indonesia: 13.41996 18.0 NC NC NC Korea: 1.7@1997 17.8 10.7 2.6 4.3 Malaysia: 11.6@1998 16.0 10.9 3.5 6.4 Argentina: 17.51999 15.9 13.1 6.2 7.6 Brazil: 3.92000 14.0 10.8 4.1 7.0 US: 0.82001 12.4 10.9 5.1 6.8 UK: 2.22002 11.1 11.0 8.9 5.4 Japan: 2.92003 9.4 8.9 6.7 5.32004 7.8 7.6 5.0 4.62005 5.5 6.0 3.6 2.8 Global range: [0.3 to 30.0]@: relates to 2005.

As part of their Annual Report, banks9presently disclose, under the head ‘Report on corporate governance’, details of theirboards of directors, number of board meetings attended by members, details of thevarious sub-committees of the boards and provided the banks are listed, information ontheir stock price movements. This is complemented with the banks’ philosophy oncorporate governance and the enabling mechanisms undertaken by the banks toachieve their philosophy. As you would be aware, such listing is an important componentof the process of ‘market discipline’, which complements the regulatory initiativesundertaken by the authorities. To take the governance process in banks a step further,we had some time back issued guidelines laying down transparent criteria fordetermining the ‘fit and proper’ status of owners and directors in private banks. Givenour focus on a consultative approach to policy formulation, the document was posted onthe RBI website for encouraging a debate on this issue. Based on the feedbackreceived, the draft is being reviewed before final guidelines can be issued to banks.The whole policy reform process has been designed to make the banking systemmore market oriented to enable efficient price discovery and to induce greater internalefficiency in the resource allocation process.  Thus, whereas the efforts in the 1960s,1970s and 1980s were essentially devoted to financial deepening, the focus of reformsin the past decade and a half has been engendering greater efficiency and productivityin the banking system in particular, and in the financial sector as a whole.  How wellhave we succeeded?4. Efficiency and productivity analysis in bankingIn recent times, a significant body of literature has evolved which explores theperformance of financial institutions in the wake of financial liberalisation. These studiesare essentially micro-economic in nature and seek to analyse the efficiency andproductivity of banking systems. Such analysis is of relevance from the policystandpoint, because as the finance-growth literature suggests, if banks become better-functioning entities, this is expected to be reflected in safety and soundness of thefinancial system and ultimately, lead to increases in the rate of economic growth. Moreimportantly, such analysis is useful in enabling policymakers to identify the success orfailure of policy initiatives or, alternatively, highlight different strategies undertaken bybanking firms which contribute to their successes.A priori, deregulation is expected to unleash competitive forces. Suchcompetition would, in turn, enable banks to alter their input and output mix, which whencombined with technological developments facilitates increase in output that raisesoverall bank productivity and efficiency. Second, liberal entry of de novo private andforeign banks as a part of the deregulation process is expected to raise bank efficiency,productivity and technology levels, because de novo private/foreign banks areassociated with superior management practices and technology, which can be fruitfullyimbibed by those which are not. A third strand of thinking, borrowing from the publicchoice framework, contends that different ownership structures may engender differentefficiency levels. The theoretical argument is straightforward: lack of capital marketdiscipline weakens owners’ control over management, enabling the latter to pursue theirown interests, and provides fewer incentives for them to be efficient. Finally, as bankingin the current world is technology driven and technological progress itself is scaleaugmenting, the relationship between bank size and efficiency becomes important.Skeptics, on the contrary, argue that deregulation is, in general, accompanied by anincrease in banks' operational cost and could induce financial fragility due to over-10expansion of banking activity. Thus, productivity gains after deregulation could betemporary and not sustainable in the long run. As a result, evidence in support of aunidirectional relationship between deregulation and efficiency/productivity is notconclusive. Besides various methods of estimation, the efficiency and productivity studies inbanking are constrained by the absence of precise definitions of inputs and outputs ofbanks. As a result, several approaches exist and the appropriateness of each approachvaries according to the circumstances (Box II).Box IIInputs and outputs of commercial banksBanks are typically multi-input and multi-output firms. As a result, defining whatconstitutes ‘input’ and ‘output’ is fraught with difficulties, since many of the financial services arejointly produced and prices are typically assigned to a bundle of financial services. Additionally,banks may not be homogeneous with respect to the types of outputs actually produced. In view ofthese complexities, four approaches have come to dominate the literature on banking output: theproduction approach, the intermediation approach, the operating (income-based) approach andmore recently, the modern approach.Under the production approach, banks are primarily viewed as providers of services tocustomers. The input set under this approach includes physical variables (e.g., labour, material,space or information systems) and the outputs represent the services provided to customers andare best measured by the number of deposit and loan accounts.Under the intermediation approach, financial institutions are viewed as intermediatingfunds between savers and investors. Banks produce intermediation services through thecollection of deposits and other liabilities and their application in interest-earning assets, such asloans, securities and other investments. This approach includes both operating and interestexpenses as inputs, whereas loans and other major assets count as outputs. In principle, thereare three variant of intermediation approach, viz., the asset approach, the user cost approach andvalue-added approach. The asset approach is a reduced form modelling of the banking activity,focusing exclusively on the role of banks as financial intermediaries between depositors and finaluses of bank assets. Deposits and other liabilities, together with real resources (labor andphysical capital) are defined as inputs, whereas the output set includes earning assets such asloans and investments. The user cost approach determines whether a financial product is aninput or an output on the basis of its net contribution to bank revenue. If the financial returns onan asset exceed the opportunity cost of the funds or alternately, if the financial costs of a liabilityare less than the opportunity cost, they are considered as outputs; otherwise, they are consideredas inputs. The value-added approach identifies major categories of produced deposits and loansas outputs because they form a significant proportion of value added.The operating approach (or income-based approach) views banks as business units withthe final objective of generating revenue from the total cost incurred for running the business.Accordingly, it defines banks’ output as the total revenue (interest and non-interest) and inputs asthe total expenses (interest and operating expenses).Finally, the modern approach seeks to integrate some measure for risk, agency costs4and quality of bank services. In this approach, the individual components of CAMEL are derivedfrom the financial tables of the banks and are used as variables in the performance analysis.Source: Adapted from Berger and Humphrey (1992) and Frexias and Rochet (1997)                                                4 CAMEL is the acronym for Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings andLiquidity.11Competition and profitability of Indian banksBeginning from 1992, Indian banks were gradually exposed to the rigours ofdomestic and international competition. Newly opened banks from the private sector andentry and expansion of several foreign banks resulted in greater competition in bothdeposit and credit markets. Consequent to these developments, there has been aconsistent decline in the share of public sector banks in total assets of commercialbanks. The evidence of competitive pressure is well supported from the declining trend5of Herfindahl’s concentration index (Table 8). Notwithstanding such transformation, thepublic sector banks still remain the mainstay, accounting for nearly three-fourths ofassets and income. It is also important to note that public sector banks have respondedto the new challenges of competition, as reflected in the increase in the share of thesebanks in the overall profit of the banking sector. From the position of net loss in the mid-1990s, in recent years the share of public sector banks in the profit of the commercialbanking system has become broadly commensurate with their share in assets, indicatinga broad convergence of profitability across various bank groups. This suggests that, withoperational flexibility, public sector banks are competing relatively effectively with privatesector and foreign banks. The ‘market discipline’ imposed by the listing of most publicsector banks has also probably contributed to this improved performance. Public sectorbank managements are now probably more attuned to the market consequences of theiractivities (Mohan, 2005).Table 8: Herfindahl’s Index of Concentration on Deposits and Credit of ScheduledCommercial Banks: 1992-2004Deposit CreditYear  (end-March)1992 8.1 10.41993 7.6 10.11994 7.4 8.61995 7.0 7.91996 6.9 7.81997 6.7 7.31998 6.6 7.41999 7.1 7.22000 6.9 6.92001 7.3 6.72002 7.1 6.02003 6.9 6.02004 6.3 5.8Source: Author's calculationsSince the late1990s, in line with the benign interest rate regime, both interestincome and interest expenditure of banks as proportions of total assets have declined.However, interest expenditure declined faster than interest income, resulting in anincrease in net interest income. However, non-interest income, which emanates mostlyfrom fee-based activities, has been increasing consistently in the post-reform period. Forexample, non-interest income as a proportion of total assets of the banking sectorincreased from 1.2 per cent in 1993 to more than 2 per cent in 2004 (Table 9). In thiscontext, it is also appropriate to mention that Indian banks, in particular the public sectorbanks, are yet to catch-up fully with their foreign counterparts.                                                5 Defined as the sum of squares of the market shares of individual banks.

Several indicators have been employed in the literature tocompare banking production costs across time. Illustratively, intermediation cost, definedas the ratio of operating expense to total assets, witnessed a gradual reduction in thepost reform period across various bank groups barring foreign banks (Table 10). Thisdecline in intermediation cost needs to be weighed against the large expendituresincurred in upgradation of information technology and institution of ‘core banking’solutions. Admittedly, intermediation costs of banks in India still tend to be higher thanthose in developed banking markets.*Table 10: Intermediation Cost of Scheduled Commercial Banks: 1992-2004                         (as percentage to total asset)Year Public Sector Indian Private Foreign All Scheduled(end-March) Banks Banks Banks Commercial Banks1992 2.60 2.97 2.26 2.591993 2.64 2.71 2.70 2.651994 2.65 2.49 2.65 2.641995 2.83 2.35 2.73 2.791996 2.99 2.47 2.78 2.941997 2.88 2.36 3.04 2.851998 2.66 2.14 2.99 2.631999 2.65 2.04 3.40 2.652000 2.52 1.85 3.12 2.482001 2.72 1.87 3.05 2.642002 2.29 1.45 3.03 2.192003 2.25 1.99 2.79 2.242004 2.20 2.01 2.76 2.20* Intermediation cost = operating expenses.Source: Computed from Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India, RBI, various years.136At a more disaggregated level, it is evident that Indian banks have improvedtheir efficiency in the post reform period as evidenced from the declining trend in per unitcost of output, irrespective of the choice of outputs (Table 11). The operating cost perunit of earning assets declined from 2.1 per cent in 1992 to 1.8 per cent in 2004;similarly, operating cost per unit of total volume of business declined from 3.4 per cent to2.6 per cent during the same period. Among the components of operating expenses,employee cost per unit of output witnessed a noticeable decline in the post-reformperiod. This decline is discernible across all bank groups, and especially for public sectorbanks in the post 2001 period consequent to the voluntary retirement scheme acrossseveral nationalised banks. On the other hand, the change in physical capital cost perunit of output has been marginal, reflecting the fact that Indian banks maintained asteady flow of investments towards physical capital formation, especially on automationand information technology.Table 11: Operating Expense and its Components of Scheduled Commercial Banks: 1992-2004                        (per cent)Year Operating Labour cost/ Non- Operating Labour cost/ Non-labour(end- expense/ earning earning labour expense/ total total cost/ total@ @ * * *March) assets assets cost/ business business businessearningassets@1992 2.08 1.40 0.68 3.42 2.30 1.121993 2.14 1.43 0.72 3.51 2.34 1.171994 2.22 1.44 0.78 3.56 2.31 1.251995 2.32 1.54 0.78 3.74 2.48 1.261996 2.48 1.73 0.75 4.01 2.80 1.221997 2.36 1.60 0.76 3.84 2.60 1.241998 2.16 1.46 0.70 3.51 2.37 1.141999 2.21 1.47 0.74 3.55 2.35 1.202000 2.05 1.37 0.68 3.22 2.15 1.062001 2.16 1.47 0.69 3.36 2.28 1.072002 1.82 1.18 0.64 2.73 1.77 0.962003 1.81 1.13 0.69 2.65 1.65 1.002004 1.78 1.08 0.71 2.61 1.58 1.03@ Earning assets = credit + investment* Total business = deposit +creditSource: Computed from Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India, RBI, various years.From the efficiency standpoint, the intermediation cost needs to be viewed inconjunction with non-interest income. Till 2001, the burden (the excess of non-interestexpenditure over non-interest income as a percentage to total assets) of commercialbanks hovered around 1 to 1.5 per cent (Table 12). This gap between intermediation                                                6Total operating cost can be broken down into labor cost and cost of physical capital. To createper unit cost measure, we deflate the operating cost and its two components by either (i) the totalearning assets (deposits plus investments), which is justified by the asset approach in measuringbanking outputs, or (ii) the aggregate of advances and deposits, which can be justified by thevalue-added approach in measuring banking outputs.14cost and income from fee-based activities has narrowed considerably in recent years.For example, the burden of Indian commercial banks declined from 1.2 per cent in 1992to 0.2 per cent in 2004. Moreover, there has been a lowering of the burden across bankgroups in recent years. The improvement in respect of Indian private banks has beenremarkable; their non-interest income in recent years has surpassed their intermediationcost and has resulted in a negative burden.*Table 12: Burden of Scheduled Commercial Banks: 1992-2004                        (as percentage to total asset)Year Public Sector Indian Private Foreign All Scheduled(end-March) Banks Banks Banks Commercial Banks1992 1.37 1.94 -1.14 1.211993 1.45 1.57 1.70 1.481994 1.39 1.16 0.42 1.301995 1.57 0.92 0.27 1.431996 1.60 0.78 0.43 1.441997 1.56 0.72 0.50 1.401998 1.33 0.19 0.03 1.111999 1.44 0.69 0.94 1.322000 1.24 0.18 0.53 1.052001 1.51 0.59 0.59 1.322002 0.86 -0.14 0.12 0.632003 0.59 -0.46 0.15 0.382004 0.29 -0.07 -0.22 0.19*Burden=non-interest expense less non-interest income. It reflects the extent to which non-interest expenses are recovered through non-interest incomeSource: Computed from Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India, RBI, various years.The cost income-ratio (defined as the ratio of operating expenses to total incomeless interest expense) of Indian banks showed a declining trend during the post reformperiod. For example, Indian banks paid roughly 45 per cent of their net income towardsmanaging labour and physical capital in 2004 as against nearly 72 per cent in 1993(Table 13). In other words, Indian banks recorded a net cost saving of nearly 27 per centof their net income during the post reform period. According to the data reported in TheBanker 2004, the cost-income ratio of world’s largest banks varied markedly from a lowof 48 per cent to a high of 116 percent and the ratio around 60 per cent is an indicativebenchmark (RBI, 2005). In that respect, the cost-income ratio of Indian banks is nowcomparable internationally. Among various ownership patterns, public sector banks havetended to have relatively higher cost-income ratio as against private banks and foreignbanks.This explanation needs to be viewed in conjunction with the differential ownershipprofile of banks. Early studies (Sarkar et al., 1998) found somewhat weak evidence tosuggest that ownership was an important determinant of performance. More recentstudies exhibit mixed evidence: while certain studies (Keova, 2003) suggest ownershipto have some effect on bank performance, others (e.g., Bhaumik and Dimova, 2004)veer around the view that competition induced public sector banks to eliminate theperformance gap that existed between them and both domestic and foreign and privatesector banks. More recent research reported differences in the efficiency of Indiancommercial banks with different ownership status, level of non-performing loans, sizeand asset quality (Das and Ghosh, 2006). More importantly, their study uncoveredevidence that public sector banks (PSBs) recorded higher efficiency gains in the post-15reform period. Clearly, the evidence here is not conclusive, because comparisons arebeset with several difficulties. Given the size and variety of PSBs, it is possible to findbanks that could equal the good private sector banks as well as bad ones. In addition,PSBs have to reckon with ‘legacy’ problems, such as many of the non-performing assetsthat they have been saddled with. Some PSBs operate in relatively backward areas withlimited discretion to pull out from such areas. The question still remains: whether there isa better payoff in enabling PSBs to improve their performance while promoting privatesector banks, as compared with an alternative policy that provides for transfer ofownership and control from the public to the private sector. Will greater scope formergers and acquisitions within and between public and private sector add to greaterefficiency?Table 13: Cost-income ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks: 1992-2004             (per cent)Year Public Sector Indian Private Foreign All Scheduled(end-March) Banks Banks Banks Commercial Banks1992 58.4 58.9 30.9 55.31993 73.7 66.8 59.2 71.91994 73.1 57.3 41.2 68.11995 67.6 52.2 40.6 63.51996 66.7 51.5 45.6 63.31997 64.3 51.3 45.6 61.01998 62.7 48.5 43.1 58.91999 65.9 58.9 56.9 64.32000 63.2 48.6 48.5 59.92001 67.0 51.8 50.0 63.42002 54.9 45.6 49.1 53.12003 47.8 45.1 46.5 47.22004 45.1 46.6 42.8 45.1Cost-income ratio= ratio of operating expenses to total income less interest expense. It measuresthe extent to which non-interest expense devours net total income.Source: Computed from Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India, RBI, various years.Another important indicator of efficiency of banks is net interest margin (NIM),defined as the excess of interest income over interest expense, scaled by total bankassets. Broadly speaking, this ratio reflects the allocative efficiency of financialintermediation, a lower ratio being indicative of higher efficiency. It is quite reasonable tobelieve that the decline in deposit rates ushered by the deregulation process will bemanifested in the lending behaviour of banks. In practice, however, lending rates havetended to be sticky downwards and seem to operate with a time lag. Historically the NIMof Indian banks is rather high. Around the onset of the reform process in 1992, the NIMof Indian banks was about 3.3 percent (Table 14). Thereafter, it recorded a relativelymodest decline to around 3 per cent in recent years. And traditionally, it is the foreignbanks, which by virtue of their ability to mobilise low-cost deposits, have the highestNIMs, whereas those for private banks have been the lowest in recent years. Thesecomparisons are not watertight: typically, small and medium banks had high NIM until71997. Thereafter, NIM for big banks recorded a rise. Contextually, it may be mentioned                                                7 Definitions of small, medium and big banks are as follows: small banks are those with assetupto Rs.50 billion; medium banks are those with asset exceeding Rs.50 billion  and upto Rs.100billion; big banks are those with asset exceeding Rs.100 billion but and upto Rs.200 billion; andlarge banks are those with asset exceeding Rs.200 billion.16that banks in most developed countries and several emerging economies have NIM (asa percentage to total assets) of around 2 per cent. This provides some indication thatcompetition in banking still has some way to go in India.@Table 14: Spread of Scheduled Commercial Banks: 1992-2004(as percentage to total asset)Year Public Sector Indian Private Foreign All Scheduled(end-March) Banks Banks Banks Commercial Banks1992 3.22 4.01 3.90 3.301993 2.39 2.92 3.57 2.511994 2.36 3.01 4.20 2.541995 2.92 3.07 4.27 3.031996 3.10 3.10 3.76 3.151997 3.16 2.95 4.13 3.221998 2.91 2.46 3.97 2.951999 2.81 2.11 3.51 2.792000 2.70 2.13 3.85 2.722001 2.84 2.33 3.64 2.842002 2.73 1.58 3.25 2.572003 2.52 1.96 3.36 2.482004 2.97 2.24 3.47 2.87@Spread = interest earned – interest paidSource: Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India, RBI, various years.ProductivityStudies on productivity in Indian banking have only begun to emanate of late. Arecent study found that total factor productivity growth has improved marginally in thepost deregulation period, but there was little evidence of narrowing of productivitydifferentials across ownership categories following deregulation (Kumbhakar and Sarkar,2003). Among various productivity indicators, labour productivity indicators like businessper employee and profit per employee are most commonly used. In addition, businessper branch is also used to judge branch-level productivity. The business per employee ofIndian banks increased over three-fold in real terms from Rs.5.4 million in 1992 toRs.16.3 million in 2004, exhibiting an annual compound growth rate of nearly 9 per cent(Table 15). At the same time, the profit per employee increased more than five-fold: fromRs.20,000 to Rs. 150,000 over the same period, implying a compound growth of around17 per cent. Branch productivity also recorded concomitant improvements. Overall, thebalance of evidence suggests distinctive productivity improvements in the banking sectorover the reform period. The extant literature suggests that such improvements could bedriven by two factors: technological improvement, which expands the range ofproduction possibilities and a catching up effect, as peer pressure amongst bankscompels them to raise productivity levels. In the context of gradual deregulation offinancial sector, several factors could have been at work: a significant shift of the best-practice frontier, driven by a combination of technological advances, financial innovationand different strategies pursued by banks suited to their business philosophy and risk-return profile, changing composition of banks’ input–output, and reduction in total costdue to improvements in overall efficiency. While it is difficult to pinpoint the relative mixof these factors in raising productivity, the bottomline is clear: Indian banks witnessedsignificant productivity improvements, post-reforms.17Table 15: Select Productivity Indicators of Scheduled Commercial Banks (Rs. million at 1993-94 prices)Year Business per employee Profit Business perper employee branch1992 5.4 0.02 109.91993 5.4 -0.05 110.41994 5.4 -0.04 109.21995 5.6 0.02 113.01996 6.0 0.01 119.61997 6.6 0.04 129.01998 7.5 0.05 144.91999 8.4 0.03 158.72000 9.7 0.05 179.42001 11.5 0.05 196.22002 13.7 0.09 214.92003 15.0 0.12 234.82004 16.3 0.15 254.5Source: Statistical Tables relating to Banks in IndiaIn a wider framework, cross-country studies of deregulation and productivitygrowth of banks report divergent views. Typically, cross-country comparisons are oftenfraught with difficulties, not only because of the different regulatory and economicregimes encountered by financial entities, but also owing to the differential quality ofservices associated with deposits and loans in different countries. Maudos and Pastor(2001) analysed the cost and profit efficiency across 14 EU economies, as well as Japanand the USA. The results uncovered the evidence that, since the start of the 1990sincreasing competition has led to gains in profit efficiency in the USA and Europe but notso in the Japanese banking system. Their results also show that the variance in ofprofitability between countries would be considerably reduced if inefficiencies wereeliminated, efficiency gains thus being a very important source of improvement inprofitability. A recent study in the Asian context analysed various efficiency measures ofSouth-East Asian (Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand) banks in thecontext of corporate governance (Williams and Nguyen, 2005). Although the motivationof the study was different, their empirical results found economic justification for thepolicy of bank privatisation.Let me encapsulate this section by making some general comments on theefficiency and productivity growth of Indian banks vis-à-vis leading Asian nations likeChina and Korea. As far as real growth (adjusted for price movement and exchange ratefluctuations) in banking business is concerned, Indian banks are favourably placed. Inrecent years, the real growth of deposits and of loans of Indian banks were noticeablyhigher than those of other Asian countries such as China and Korea. At the same time,profitability of Indian banks, as determined by the return on assets, is also much higher(Tables 16, 17, 18 and 19). The intermediation cost of Indian banks seems to berelatively higher than that of Korea and China. Nonetheless, higher operating cost inIndia is well compensated by the higher non-interest income, as compared to otherAsian countries. Finally, the labour productivity of the top 4 banks in India (whichincludes one de novo private bank) and the four state-owned Chinese banks indicatesthat except the private bank, the top three public sector banks in India recorded muchlower employee productivity. However, in the absence of data on employment for banks18in other countries, it is difficult to ascertain the degree of labour productivity differentialsacross countries.8Table 16: Spread (net interest margin) of banks of major Asian countries(as percentage to total asset)Year China Indonesia Korea Malaysia Philippines Thailand India1996 1.86 2.92 1.70 2.91 4.07 2.57 3.071997 2.27 2.76 1.80 2.94 4.21 3.00 2.831998 2.16 -9.38 1.69 3.32 4.52 0.74 2.661999 1.83 -3.11 2.03 2.67 3.16 0.69 2.562000 1.76 2.21 2.06 3.02 2.54 1.43 2.742001 1.78 3.16 2.12 2.83 2.60 1.69 2.542002 1.78 3.61 2.33 2.70 2.29 1.84 2.742003 1.87 4.22 2.50 2.61 2.30 1.99 2.84Source: BankScopeTable 17: Intermediation cost (operating expense) of banks of major Asian countries(as percentage to total asset)Year China Indonesia Korea Malaysia Philippines Thailand India1996 1.23 2.39 2.24 1.42 3.52 1.50 2.771997 1.24 4.50 2.55 1.49 3.28 2.05 2.601998 1.40 4.04 2.53 1.68 3.67 2.54 2.581999 1.18 2.83 1.53 1.50 3.38 2.20 2.412000 1.12 2.72 1.46 1.70 3.32 1.98 2.572001 1.10 2.36 1.42 1.80 3.30 2.01 2.212002 1.05 2.73 1.39 1.73 3.16 1.78 2.222003 1.01 2.94 1.38 1.61 3.00 1.71 2.19Source: BankScopeTable 18: Non-interest income of banks of major Asian countries(as percentage to total asset)Year China Indonesia Korea Malaysia Philippines Thailand India1996 0.26 0.99 1.06 0.98 2.12 0.68 1.441997 0.24 2.97 0.93 1.10 1.73 1.00 1.491998 0.13 1.31 0.20 1.16 1.96 1.03 1.381999 0.17 1.96 0.99 1.00 1.95 0.97 1.472000 0.22 1.51 0.74 1.01 1.59 0.62 1.332001 0.22 1.08 1.28 1.15 1.73 0.73 1.492002 0.25 1.30 0.91 1.11 2.11 0.93 1.832003 0.25 1.46 0.80 0.94 2.16 0.95 1.97Source: BankScope                                                8The figures reported in Tables 16-19 for India are not strictly comparable with earlier tablesbecause of different data sources.19Table 19: Net profit of banks of major Asian countries (as percentage to total asset)Year China Indonesia Korea Malaysia Philippines Thailand India1996 0.29 1.01 0.17 1.40 2.06 -0.56 0.711997 0.30 -0.39 -0.84 1.03 1.63 -1.17 0.901998 0.20 -46.92 -3.10 0.04 0.85 -5.57 0.541999 0.17 -9.20 -1.40 0.96 0.10 -5.88 0.702000 0.21 0.46 -0.37 1.29 -0.03 -0.15 0.482001 0.20 0.87 0.76 0.68 0.48 1.46 0.692002 0.20 1.30 0.60 1.03 0.60 0.21 0.972003 0.12 1.61 0.15 1.08 1.08 0.63 1.14Source: BankScopeA clear message emanating from these findings is the role of technology indriving productivity and efficiency improvements. In today's world of banking, technologyis considered as the basic tool of the "process engineers" of the organisation. It is crucialfor the design, control, and execution of service delivery in banks. Therefore, a keydriver of efficiency and productivity in the banking industry today is the effective use oftechnology. This is a crucial pre-requisite for capitalising on future opportunities for thebanking sector. In effect, it has become the key to servicing all customer segments –offering convenience to retail customer, corporates and government clients. Theincreasing sophistication, flexibility and complexity of products and servicing offeringsmakes the effective use of technology critical for managing the risks associated withbanking business. However, the ‘technological penetration’ in India has been quitemodest. According to data reported in the World Development Indicators database, as of2002, the number of computers per 1000 persons was about 7 in India compared toanywhere between 70-500 in most emerging markets and even higher in most9developed economies. Wide disparities exist within the banking sector as far astechnological capabilities are concerned: the percentage of ‘computer literate’employees as percentage of total staff in 2000 was around 20 per cent in public sectorbanks compared with 100 per cent in new private and around 90 per cent in foreignbanks (Reserve Bank of India, 2002). Data reported by the RBI suggests that nearly 71per cent of branches of public sector banks are fully computerized. However,computerization needs to go beyond the mere ‘arithmeticals’, to borrow a term from theReport of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Government of India, 1998), andinstead, needs to be leveraged optimally to achieve and maintain high service andefficiency standards. In fact, recent research on the role of technology in drivingproductivity improvements in banking demonstrates that computer employees and ITcapital exhibit higher productivities than their respective non-computer employees andnon-IT capital, respectively (Huang, 2005). The challenge, therefore, remains three fold:acquiring the ‘right’ technology, deploying it optimally and remaining cost-effective whilstdelivering sustainable returns to shareholders. In effect, ‘managing’ technology so as toreap the maximum benefits remains a key challenge for the Indian banks.                                                9 The reported figure for Pakistan was 4.21 in 2001.205. Way AheadHow do we see the future? In this context, I would like to share with you some ofthe issues that need to be kept in view while discussing productivity and efficiency inbanks.  Needless to state, these issues remain relevant, in varying degrees, ineconomies that share similar features in the banking sector, as ours.First, many of you would be aware that small and medium enterprises (SMEs)constitute an important segment of the industrial and services sectors in India in view oftheir significant contributions to employment generation as also exports. With theemergence of new activities in the rural segment such as agri-clinics, contract farmingand rural housing with forward and backward linkages to SMEs, lending to SMEs hasbecome a viable revenue proposition for banks. The Reserve Bank has also initiatedseveral measures to streamline the flow of credit and address structural bottlenecks incredit delivery to this segment. Salient among these include fixing of self-set targets forfinancing, rationalisation of cost of loans, expanding the outreach of formal credit, andformulation of comprehensive and more liberal policies for credit extension. Public sectorbanks have also been advised to constitute specialized SME branches in identifiedclusters/centers with preponderance of small and medium enterprises. A noteworthydevelopment in this context has been the passage of the Credit Information Companies(Regulation) Act, 2005 in the Parliament. The Act is expected to encourage setting up ofcredit information companies and thereby, improve exchange of information on credithistories of borrowers. Coupled with appropriate risk assessment models andmechanisms, this is expected to lower transactions costs of banks. The overall effect ofthis process is likely to be reflected in a lowering of the risk premium embedded ininterest rates charged to SMEs with positive spillovers for bank lending to the SMEsector.Although liberalisation of financial services and competition has improvedcustomer services, experience shows that customers' interests are not always accordedpriority. More importantly, concerns have been raised with regard to banking practicesthat tend to exclude vast segments of the population. In this context, the Reserve Bankhas announced its intention to implement policies to incentivise banks to provideextensive services responsive to the needs of the under-privileged. As part of theprocess, the Reserve Bank has recently advised all banks to make available a basicbanking ‘no frills’ account either with ‘nil’ or very low minimum balances as well ascharges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of population. Thenature and number of transactions in such accounts could be restricted, but madeknown to the customer in advance in a transparent manner. Banks have been urged togive wide publicity to this facility so as to ensure greater financial inclusion.The growth performance of the Indian economy during the last few yearsindicates a possible ratcheting up of the trend rate of growth from around 6 per cent toaround 8 per cent per year. Yet, there is a need to undertake significant efforts toachieve higher rates of growth in a sustained manner. The current levels of investmentmight not be adequate to achieve such growth rates, even after accounting forreductions in the existing incremental capital-output ratios. Looking beyond the aspect offiscal consolidation, action on several fronts needs to be pursued vigorously to step upgrowth rates. First is the issue of investment in agriculture and allied activities, a sectorthat produces 21 per cent of GDP, but supports nearly 60 per cent of the population.21There is often substantial loss of output owing to inadequate storage and transportfacilities and paucity of adequate food processing capacities. This necessitates greaterpublic and private investment on these post-harvest facilities to not only increase valueaddition, but also to improve the agriculture-industry linkage. The second issue of importis the simplification of procedures. Cumbersome procedural formalities introduce delaysand results in significant output losses. Added to these, the de-reservation of items fromexclusive production under SSI units is likely to permit the sector reap economies ofscale and scope and enhance competitiveness. The third is the issue of finances. Theincipient investment boom in infrastructure, industry and services will yield best resultsonly if enormous resource flows are successfully intermediated at a low cost. This willdepend on the ability of the financial sector to process information properly and tointermediate the extant savings into optimal investment by specific firms and sectors.The fourth aspect of stepping up investment is to address the deficiencies ininfrastructure. The decline in public spending on infrastructure has not been adequatelycompensated by the private sector, possibly owing to difficulties in the regulatoryenvironment. Therefore, nurturing an appropriate policy framework, with a conduciveenvironment for public-private participation, remains the key to accelerating investmentin infrastructure. The final aspect is the need to complement domestic investment withhigher foreign investment, primarily in the form of FDI. Such investment is likely to triggertechnology spillovers, assist human capital formation and more generally, improve theefficiency of resource use.Over the reform period, more and more banks have begun to get listed on thestock exchange, which, in its wake, has led to greater market discipline andconcomitantly, to an improvement in their governance aspects as well. This has led to abroadbasing of the ownership of PSBs. Such diversification of ownership has also led toa qualitative difference in their functioning, since there is induction of privateshareholding as well as attendant issues of shareholder’s value, as reflected by themarket capitalisation, board representation and interests of minority shareholders(Reddy, 2002). The issue of mixed ownership as an institutional structure wheregovernment has controlling interest is a salient feature of bank governance in India.Such aspects of corporate governance in PSBs is important, not only because PSBsdominate the banking industry, but also because, it is likely that they would continue toremain in banking business. To the extent there is public ownership of PSBs, themultiple objectives of the government as owner and the complex principal-agentrelationships needs to be taken on board. Given the increased technical complexity ofmost business activities including banking and the rapid pace of change in financialmarkets and practices, PSBs would need to devise imaginative ways of responding tothe evolving challenges within the context of mixed ownership. All in all, this is anexciting phase for PSBs to grow and prosper, and it is up to these banks to respond tothe challenges.Let me conclude: the address has have traversed a modest terrain, focusing onthe efficiency and productivity changes in Indian banking. The patterns of efficiency andtechnological change witnessed in Indian banking can be viewed as consistent withexpectations in an industry undergoing rapid change in response to the forces ofderegulation. In reaction to evolving market prospects, a few pioneering banks mightadjust quickly to seize the emerging opportunities, while others respond cautiously. Asderegulation gathers momentum, commercial banks would need to devise imaginativeways of augmenting their incomes and more importantly their fee-incomes so as to raiseefficiency and productivity levels.22ReferencesBell, C and P.
