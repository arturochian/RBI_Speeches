1Inclusive Growth : Role of Financial EducationI thank the Indian Banks Association and hosts Andhra Bank for inviting me for this Conference.I am aware you have had illustrious speakers and expert sessions on various issuesreverberating in policy conundrums of 'financial inclusion' and financially inclusive growth. Why Iterm these as conundrums is for the reason that on the one hand, everyone accepts that a broadbased access to formal financial services is a sine qua non for the aspiration of growth in GDPand economic development at large to be fulfilled; while on the other, the initiatives emerging inthis direction have at best been confined to small pockets. The problem is not specific to Indiaand many countries have been groping for the inflexion point in finding solutions to this problem.At the macro level, it is perhaps only in the recent past that this area is witnessing the academicrigour of the scale seen in the mainstream finance. It could be due to inherent nature of theissues we are grappling with. Most of the initiatives have been 'within the framework' solutions,which have inherent limitations.  This point comes out all the more starkly in the context of theexplosion in financial innovations and products witnessed in mainstream finance.To elaborate this point, it would be interesting to look at the evolution of the discipline of financein general and banking in particular. Till a few decades back, the field of finance itself was, in asense, second cousin to the domain of 'economics' and it was only the revolutionary ideas andtheories relating to asset pricing, particularly traded stocks to begin with, that changed thelandscape. The subsequent academic contributions in the area of option pricing triggered therevolution in derivatives which has, in effect, commoditised the financing needs as well as optionsavailable to a certain segment of the corporate and retail sector.  The above advances in the fieldof finance have evolved in response to a given set of circumstances in the industrial economiesand the applications designed around these were aimed at a particular target group. Most of theprinciples have gradually found wide acceptance and have been imbibed across the globe,including India. We now need a similar revolution in fostering financially inclusive growth.However, the needs of a complex country like India are very different and finding universalsolutions to these could be really challenging, particularly in fostering a 'financially inclusivegrowth'.Financially inclusive growth straddles a lot of issues which have been deliberated upon at lengthduring the previous sessions. I intend to confine my address to one of the important facets of thischallenge - the challenge of financial education.                                                          1 Special Address by Ms. Shyamala Gopinath at BANCON- 2006, Hyderabad on November 4,20061Financial Education - the conceptFinancial education can be comprehensively defined as “the process by which financialconsumers/investors improve their understanding of financial products, concepts and risks and,through information, instruction and/or objective advice, develop the skills and confidence tobecome more aware of financial risks and opportunities, to make informed choices, to knowwhere to go for help, and to take other effective actions to improve their financial well-being”.Financial education thus goes beyond the provision of financial information and advice. The focusof any discussion on financial education is primarily on the individual, who usually has limitedresources and skills to appreciate the complexities of financial dealings with financialintermediaries on matters relating to personal finance on a day to day basis.Role of financial education vis-a-vis financial inclusionIn the context of 'financial inclusion', the scope of financial education is relatively broader and itacquires greater significance since it could be an important factor in the very access of suchexcluded groups to finance. Further, the process of educating may invariably involve addressingdeep entrenched behavioural and psychological factors that could be major barriers.  However,the complementary relationship between microfinance and financial education is obvious andfinancial literacy can increase the decision making power and prepare them to cope with thefinancial demands of daily life.In countries with diverse social and economic profile like India, financial education is particularlyrelevant for people who are resource poor and who operate at the margin and are vulnerable topersistent downward financial pressures. With no established banking relationship, the un-bankedpoor are pushed towards expensive alternatives. The challenges of household cash managementunder difficult circumstances with few resources to fall back on could be accentuated by the lackof skills or knowledge to make well informed financial decisions. Financial education can helpthem prepare ahead of time for life cycle needs and deal with unexpected emergencies withoutassuming unnecessary debt.2As per an OECD study , the provision of education programmes for the un/underbanked groupscan play important roles: they can encourage un/underbanked consumers to enter into or make better use of thefinancial mainstream, they can help to retain them as successful account holders in the short term and they can contribute to keeping them as savers for the long-term.                                                          2 "Improving Financial Literacy: Analysis of Issues and Policies", OECD, 20052 they can contribute to asset building  among householdsChallenges in devising a financial education programDevising financial education initiatives for the un/underbanked has to take into account theexisting financial landscape, the social economic realities of this class and the fact that invariably,such groups are beset with low literacy levels.The main difference in the financial planning for the poor families is that they have fewerresources and opportunities. When people are struggling to make ends meet on a day-to-daybasis, good money management becomes a daily challenge. While they use many creativeingenuous strategies to manage their money, these often develop through trial and error ratherthan by design. Financial education has a role in "building the capacity of the poor to gain control,become proactive, use information and resources to enhance their economic security and moreeffectively use financial services". When better-informed clients become better consumers offinancial services, financial institutions benefit.Further, as already mentioned, the process of educating may invariably involve addressing deepentrenched behavioural and psychological factors that could be major barriers. For example, incase of many of the microfinance initiatives operating on the 'group liability' concept it could be agreat challenge to drive home the very basic rationale for such an arrangement, starting frominculcating the habit of small savings to appreciation of the concept of 'collective responsibility'.3A study regarding Mexican experience has highlighted that the social and cultural factorsembedded in the financial landscape greatly influence the ability of individuals to use financialservices effectively. Results indicate that in addition to material resources, the inherent nature ofsocial relations and community links played a crucial role in improving access to and use offinancial services. The transformation of financial information, knowledge, experience, attitudesand social relationships into financial education and sophistication constituted a cognitiveresource to reducing vulnerability. This leads us to suggest that a culture of finance is animportant catalyst for individuals’ change and development.It is also important to note that financial education may contribute to behavior modification, butmany factors lend to influence a person’s financial behavior. Contrary to common belief,motivation is cultivated internally and rarely can be cultivated—sustainably, at least—by anexternal factor. The biggest obstacle to financial education is motivating individuals to pursue it. Inother words, financial education does not necessarily motivate individuals; motivation bringsindividuals to financial education. Here the role of banks assumes importance as financialcounselors of the clients.                                                          3 Financial Services as a means to  reduce vulnerability, Max Nino-Zarazua, University of Bath3Possible themesInspite of the above challenges, it should be possible to arrive at a set of basic themes/issues thatcould be addressed effectively through a financial education program. As per a study conducted4by the under the project "Financial Education for the Poor" by Microfinance Opportunities , amicroenterprise resource center, a consistent demand was found for the following broad themesof financial education: Money Management: How to proactively manage money Debt Management: How to control debt and avoid over-indebtedness Managing Savings: How to save regularly and in a safe location Financial Negotiations: How to strengthen clients' bargaining position vis-à-vis inputsuppliers, other household members, and financial institutions Use of Bank Services: How banks work and impose charges; How clients can maximizebank services, interact with banks, and effectively use ATMsAn analysis of such programs in the OECD countries reveals that many educational programmesare integrated into the provision of specific financial services, such as first or basic bankaccounts, checking and savings accounts and matched-savings plans while others adopt a broadstand-alone approach, teaching budgeting, savings and credit management, etc., with noconnection to any product of service.  Aims tend to vary according to the majority targetpopulation. For the generic unbanked, aims are to explain the benefits and use of bank accountownership and services or to build up fundamental financial literacy skills.  For low/moderate-income underserved consumers, most programmes offer advice ongeneral money and credit management; whereas others have a specific goal or areembedded in schemes to encourage savings, asset-building and homeownership.These initiatives aim to build economic empowerment and increase long-term self-sufficiency inorder to revitalize and stabilize disadvantaged communities.Indian context                                                          4 Financial Education: A Win-Win for Clients and MFIs, Cohen, M., Stack, K. & McGuinness, E.http://www.microfinanceopportunities.org/docs/Financial_Education_A_Win_Win_for_Clients_and_MFIs.pdf4Financial education has an ever more critical role to play in the changed financial landscape ofthe country which, while on one hand has presented with newer opportunities for future collectivegrowth, on the other, it has also heightened fears of uncertainty in certain quarters mainlybecause of increasing multi-faceted choices and options in the management of personal financesand exposure to a gamut of risks. The issue of inclusive growth has been given top priority and inthis direction, the banking sector is expected to play its part. The initiatives on financial inclusionso far, have been a small step in this direction. Financial education could ideally supplementthese initiatives for long term efficacy.…Some issuesOne of the major hindrances in the way of delivery of financial services is the lack of basicknowledge and lack of awareness of the products and services available from the banks. It isimportant to note that the Financial Inclusion Task Force of the United Kingdom, one of thepioneers to talk of financial inclusion, has identified 'access to free face-to-face money advice' asan important component of financial inclusion, apart from 'access to banking' and 'access toaffordable credit'. People need information and advice when they either save their money or getinto debt. Such information and guidance can best be delivered by appropriate mechanisms andif such effective mechanisms are put in place through the banks, they in turn would reinforce thedemand for financial services.Another impediment is the difficulty or the lack of ease of addressing issues that affect a commonman. Despite concerted efforts, the current state of transparency coupled with the difficulty ofconsumers in identifying and understanding fine print information leads to an informationasymmetry between the financial intermediary and the customer. It is important to understandthat the lack of such awareness in itself amounts to risk; and the challenge is to make customersaware of the various risk. In terms of promoting financial inclusion, much of the work is simply inproviding easily understood information in a safe and engaging environment.…Scope for financial educationUndoubtedly, there is a role for promoting financial education in the context of developmentpolicies and programs to reduce vulnerability and expand opportunities for the poor. To this end,there is a need to explore the potential for integrating financial literacy into various types ofdevelopment programs: microfinance, vocational education, skills training, business development,health, nutrition, agriculture, and food security programs. In the late 1990s a move in the UK andUS to have all Government payments made electronically contributed to heightening theimportance of financial exclusion as a policy concern. Electronic government payments havemade having a bank account essential in order to receive payments and benefits. This has madeit all the more important for unbanked consumers to access information on basic bank accounts5savings accounts and other financial services. Financial education programs would be required toaccess information on financial services. In India too, improved technology will enable, for example, Governments to make all payments,including under various schemes electronically. I understand that in Andhra Pradesh, the StateGovernment has taken initiative to make payments thorough e-seva. Other states have alsolaunched such initiatives. Governments should now explore the possibility of direct credit to bankaccounts. Eventually, part of the funds received by the beneficiary under various governmentschemes and deposited with the banks can form part of the seed capital for forming Self HelpGroups (SHGs) for such beneficiaries.While some banks have on their own taken steps to provide such education, any large scaledelivery of financial education needs to leverage on the experience and expertise of otheragencies, such as private entities, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations,outlets of the corporate sector etc., apart from Government initiatives, wherever available.The use of information technology offers a lot of promise in providing financial literacy andeducation and experience in several parts of the country through the use of rural informationkiosks, mobile vans, etc. which have shown to what extent IT can be leveraged to provideinformation on various products and services. Information kiosks can be run by the BusinessCorrespondents or installed in PCOs, etc. to disseminate information about not only bankingproducts, but also other useful information like input/output prices, insurance products, healthservices, weather information, etc. Such variety of knowledge would help in better risk mitigation,lesser documentation hassles while sanctioning loans, etc. The kiosks need not even have anyconnectivity and the service personnel can perform most of the updating through electronic medialike CDs. Banks can provide funds for setting-up such kiosks and meeting the running costs orthe cost can be shared among banks, and the other organizations involved in the process.Some non-banking initiatives are also being experimented in various parts of the country. In thiscontext, the project on financial counseling service for poor self-employed women in India startedby SEWA is well known. Project Tomorrow, as it is called, was started in 2001 with a purpose todevelop and test a financial counseling curriculum to help participants manage moneyproductively, plan ways to increase assets, address life cycle events, manage risks. Through thisproject, SEWA has set up a training unit and training delivery system and is developing tools andprocedures to monitor the counseling work. The project began with market research to assess theneeds and demand among SEWA clients for financial education, followed by a 'training oftrainers' course. SEWA is now providing financial counseling to its clients through a weeklycourse. The initial experience suggests that participants grasp the concepts presented andwelcome new perspectives stemming from such training.6…Extending the Scope While talking about financial education, it is important that the focus also extends to theurban populace, including the literate masses, which may not be having the financialacumen, technology suaveness and may not be 'financially literate'.  It is not that theurban masses are well versed in the Internet Banking and other newer methods ofbanking; there continues to remain a segment, which either avoids using the services dueto lack of confidence or remains unaware of the options available. Financial education tosuch target group would be mutually beneficial.  There is also need for greater awareness of various products and services offered bybanks. A specific case that comes to mind pertains to the housing finance sector. RBIhad also raised  the issue of transparency and fairness in housing loans in the recentmid-term review of monetary policy. It has been reported that some banks, while lendingfor housing, are not fully transparent in indicating the factors governing the benchmark inrespect of floating rates as well as in regard to reset clauses. As part of consumerawareness, many initiatives have been taken to increase the disclosure levels on part oflenders, but effectiveness of all this would be predicated on the financial understanding ofthe person taking the loan. The short point is - Does the consumer understand theunderlying principle of a floating rate or can he even ensure that the bank has been fairand transparent in its dealing with him? Clearly, there is need for financial education toprevent vulnerable consumers from falling prey to "financially disquieting creditarrangements".Even in regard to remittance facilities and foreign exchange encashment, the lack ofawareness about the various facilities could adversely impact a population segment atthe 'bottom of the pyramid' which is the beneficiary of smaller remittances from migrantworkers.  Recently, a Working Group on Cost of NRI Remittances has stressed in itsreport the need for an ongoing 'awareness program' for imparting basic awareness onfacilities existing for making remittances, particularly for migrant workers. Apart fromother things, this could also help in reducing the cost of effecting remittances.  Though the term 'financial education has come to be associated with individual/personalfinance, a very important segment that must be brought under the ambit of suchinitiatives relates to small entrepreneurs and small businesses. Particularly when theeffort is towards 'inclusive growth', it is these segments in smaller cities and towns thatcould really showcase the benefits of economic growth. The focus in such cases, wouldobviously be different, with greater stress on awareness and timeliness of financial7advice, instead of just education. Such timely advice could be the deciding factor in thesuccess or failure of their ventures. In all probability, the promoters of these smallventures would be educated and already have a business sense and a business idea thatneeds to be actualized. It is here that awareness about new financial products and anunderstanding of their pricing could enable them to ensure that they understand thedownsides of the product, present and future, and be in a better bargaining position vis-à-vis the lender.  Finally, the concept of financial education could ideally be stretched to cover economiceducation as well. At a broader societal level, given the path of economic reforms Indiahas embraced since the early nineties, and the ensuing debates, it is imperative that thesociety and general populace be objectively informed about the fundamental economicissues and the rationale for, at-times difficult, choices to be made in this regard. Thiscould go a long way in creating an informed and harmonious democracy.ConclusionThere is a need for banks and other agencies striving to extend financial education to the massesto appreciate that financial inclusion is a continuous process. Efforts to extend literacy to makethe common man enabled by being aware of the evolving functional, legal and technical issuescannot be a one-time effort.A common effort of the educational programmes typically focusses on the 'supply' side thatstresses on attracting customers in the financial fold. However, what is needed is to have is an"auto pilot" concept, where the prospective customer is empowered to make / demand thedesired services. This could create a qualitative 'demand' situation of the financial services.The objective of financial education is also customer protection. It helps customers to betterunderstand and manage financial risk and deal with complexities of the market place place andtake advantage of increased competition and choice in the financial sector. The RBI, on its part,intends to advance the cause of financial education in the country as part of an overall strategy.Currently, a process of credit counseling is being encouraged to help all borrowers, particularlythose in distress, to overcome current financial problems and gain access to the structuredfinancial system.However, in the ultimate analysis financial education is only one pillar of an adequate financialpolicy to improve financial literacy and expand access to financial services. It can complement,but not replace other pillars such as greater transparency, policies on consumer protection andregulation of financial institutions. I do hope that in our collective interest the issues raised in thisConference are operationalised and translated into grass root level initiatives.8
