Role of Financial Sector in the Growth of the Southern Region– A Question of BalancingGood Morning Ladies and Gentlemen!2. The importance and the lead role of financial sector for economicdevelopment attracted the attention of economists, policy makers as well asexecutors. According to Goldsmith (1969:400), “mobilizing liquid resourceaccelerates economic growth and improves economic performance to theextent that it facilitates the migration of funds to the best user, i.e. to theplace in the economic system where the funds will find the highest socialreturn”.3. In the analysis of financial institutions in Schumpeter’s work, banking wasconsidered as one of the primary and essential factors for economicdevelopment. In the whole process of development, Schumpeter (1933 and1939) regarded the banking system as one of the two key agents (the otherbeing entrepreneurship). Given this impetus, it is worth mentioning that thecorrelation between bank credit and economic growth is resilient.4. It is thus the financial system that has been tasked to intermediate to usherin efficient allocation of resources.  Banking system has, in fact, becomespecial with its main functions of mobilizing savings of public and its efficientallocation for various productive activities and providing access to thosesections of entrepreneurs who are unable to find any formal financial service.In the Indian context, such allocation of resources for economic activity isdone mainly by banks, but the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), the Co-operative banks and the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) alsocontribute in fulfilling this task.  In India, the guidance/directions given to thebanking system, with regard to the social banking in the 1970s and 1980sand with the introduction of comprehensive economic and financial sectorreforms in the 1990s helped in addressing the gaps in financing economicactivities. Further, the introduction of financial inclusion and the related policy__________________________________________________________________________Speech delivered by Shri R.

Arunachalaraman isgratefully acknowledged.measures initiated both by the Government of India and by Reserve Bank ofIndia in recent decade enabled banks to reach the extra mile and not todistinguish between micro and small enterprises, street vendors, smallbusiness entrepreneurs, etc.5. India being such a large country that it’s different regions are at differentstates of economic development and have been growing at different speeds.Public policy does recognize this and therefore, has provisions that strategiessuiting the levels and speeds of economic growth in the regions be pursued.6. Today, I will be focusing on the ‘Role of Financial Sector in the Growth ofthe Southern Region’. Since banks are the major players in the financialsystem, my talk will be centred on the role of banks for economic growth andits future prospects for the region. I have organized my talk as follows:(a) I will briefly discuss about major economic parameters of the southernregion.(b) then I will be analyzing the linkage to growth based on (i) Deposits toGSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) (ii) Banks’ Credit to GSDP (GrossState Domestic Product) (iii) C/D ratio and (iv) Urban Cooperative Banks(UCBs) in the allocation of resources for economic activities in the region (v)role of NBFCs and (vi) financial inclusion - general trend in the region.(c) Thereafter, I will discuss the scope of the banking sector in the emergingdevelopments of the region and what more can be done by the banks tofurther the growth in the region.Economic Growth7. During the pre - reform period of 1980s, the growth rates of the states inthe southern region were generally less than the all India growth rate. Duringthe 1990s, after the economic and financial sector reforms, these statesperformed better than the all-India growth rate. The growth rates were stillhigher, during the last 10 years or so when greater push had been given forfinancial inclusion. (Pl see Table 1).2Table 1: Economic Growth Rate of Southern States (Per cent)Particulars Pre-reform period Post-reform period Financial1980-81 to 1990- Inclusion drive1991-92 to 2001-02 to91 2006-07 to 2013-2000-01 2005-0614Andhra 5.0 5.4 6.8 8.0PradeshKarnataka 5.2 6.9 6.2 6.8Kerala 2.4 5.0 7.6 7.8*Tamil Nadu 5.7 11.6 6.3 8.6All India 5.6 5.7 6.8 7.4*Data relates to the period 2006-07 to 2012-13Source: Central Statistics Office (CSO)Per capita income8. Let us now look at another indicator of economic prosperity viz., per capitaincome. The per capita income of the region over the last three decadescompared with other regions showed that this region has performed verywell. In fact, during 1980s, this region’s average per capita income was belowthe national average. During the 1990s, while Kerala and Tamil Nadusurpassed the national average, AP and Karnataka were just below thenational average. However, during the 2000s, the entire region was muchmore than the national average. (Pl see Table 2)Table 2: Average Per Capita Income of the Southern Region based on Net State Domestic Product(NSDP) at current prices (Amount in` )States Pre-reform Period Post-reform Period1980-81 to 1990-91 1991-92 to 2000-01 2001-02 to 2005-06 2006-07 to 2013-14*Andhra 2557 10673 22760 58798PradeshKarnataka 2765 11497 23438 59053Kerala 2586 12388 27777 61994Tamil Nadu 2857 13020 26433 73302All-India 3364 11616 22253 51519[Net NationalIncome]*Excluding 2013-14 figures of Kerala State as not availableSource: Central Statistics Office (CSO)3Banking IndicatorsNumber of offices9. Let us now turn to the role played by the commercial banks as part of thefinancial system for the progress of the region. Commercial banks, which areinvolved in providing credit facilities and making investments for productiveactivities as well as broadening banking practices under financial inclusion,have expanded their offices across the region. The number of offices(including Regional Rural Banks) expanded in the region by moving upsharply from 17,613 end-March 1999 to 29,135 at end-March 2013(excluding U.Ts of Pudhucherry and Lakshadweep).Table 3: No. of Bank Offices: Southern RegionStates Pre-reform Post-reform PeriodPeriod*1980-81 to1991-92 to2001-02 to2006-07 to1990-91 2000-01 2005-06 2012-13Andhra Pradesh 3709 4863 5286 6754Karnataka3187 4483 4850 5932Kerala 2606 3055 3399 4205Tamil Nadu 3691 4548 5635 5481Southern Region 13193 16949 19170 22372All-India49823 63032 67065 82732Source:  Figures furnished are average number of reporting bank offices worked out based onStatistical Tables Relating to Banks in India, Various Issues, Reserve Bank of India.*Pre-reform period data excludes the years 1988 and 1989 for Southern States.4Role of banks10. I would like to highlight the involvement of commercial banks in thedevelopment of the region.  For measuring the role of banks, the followingparameters have been considered by me: (a) deposits to GSDP, (b) credit toGSDP and (c) C/D ratio. The role played by banks has been analysed underthese categories in terms of: (a) prior to the introduction of financial sectorreforms; (b) post financial sector reform period and (c) inclusive growthperiod. Prior to 1991, the deposit to GSDP of combined Andhra Pradesh in1981 was hardly 28.0 per cent, credit to GSDP ratio was 21.1 per cent andCredit to Deposit ratio was 75.3 per cent. This moved up to an impressivelevel of 52.8 per cent, 58.1 per cent and 109.9 per cent, respectively, in 2013,underscoring banking penetration for the growth in the combined State ofAndhra Pradesh (Table 4). In fact, banks have played deeper role, evenbetter in the rest of the region like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala states.Table 4: Important Banking Indicators of Performance: Southern Region (Per cent)Year Particulars Andhra Karnataka Kerala Tamil All-IndiaPradesh Nadu2013 Deposits-GSDP Ratio 52.8 88.6 67.0 60.0 75.1Credit-GSDP Ratio 58.1 63.2 49.2 73.8 58.6C/D Ratio 109.9 71.4 73.3 123.0 78.12001 Deposits-GSDP Ratio 37.6 51.3 62.3 43.2 47.5Credit-GSDP Ratio 23.8 30.4 26.8 39.2 27.8C/D Ratio 63.3 59.3 43.1 90.6 58.51991 Deposits-GSDP Ratio 31.8 41.3 54.6 43.1 37.6Credit-GSDP Ratio 26.3 35.5 32.3 43.3 24.9C/D Ratio 82.6 85.8 59.1 100.5 66.21981 Deposit-GSDP Ratio 28.0 37.1 39.8 36.8 32.3Credit-GSDP Ratio 21.1 28.5 28.5 35.0 22.0C/D Ratio 75.3 77.0 71.5 95.1 68.1Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaUrban Co-operative Banks11. Another important institutional set up in the financial system allocatingfunds for economic activities is by Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs). As atend- March 2014, a total of 557 UCBs under both scheduled and non-scheduled categories were operating in the region. These UCBs put-togetherhave mobilized public deposits totaling ` 48,461.41crore as at end-March2014 and funded various activities in the region amounting to ` 32,146.15crore at end-March (Table 5).5Table 5: Profile of Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) – Southern Region  (Amt. in` crore)Sl.

In India, even today, we have a huge slice of our populace, comprisingmainly less privileged people that remains largely excluded from the formalfinancial system. In order to take the banking service to the so far financiallyexcluded society, constant and special measures have been taken by theGovernment of India and the Reserve Bank under the ‘Financial Inclusion’programme whereby a roadmap has been set to achieve 100 per centFinancial Inclusion in the entire country.15. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank, in January 2006, permitted banks toengage Business Correspondents (BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs) asintermediaries for providing financial and banking services.  Reserve Bankhas also from time to time enlarged the list of eligible individuals / entities8who can be engaged as BCs. The BC model allows banks to provide doorstep delivery of services especially cash in – cash out transactions at alocation much closer to the population, thus addressing the last mile problem.16. In our efforts to achieve sustained, planned and structured financialinclusion, we have advised all public and private sector banks to put in placea Board approved Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) to achieve the target latestby March 2016.  In addition, we have asked banks to integrate approvedFIPs with their business plans and to include the criteria on financial inclusionas a parameter in the performance evaluation of their staff.17. As a result, banks have made further stride in providing banking servicesto the people. I am happy that commercial banks under ‘Financial Inclusion’agenda are moving in tandem with the target in the entire Southern Region.While the villages under population above 2000 have been covered, theprocess for ensuring complete coverage of villages with population below2,000 is progressing well.18. As per CRISIL’s financial inclusion index called Inclusix, which coversthree parameters of branch penetration, deposit penetration and creditpenetration, on a scale of 100, the highest financial inclusion of 66.1 pointshas been achieved by the Southern Region in 2012, as against 42.8 for all-India. This also indicates that more extension and expansion of the countryas a whole, and even in this region.What more for the region – A Balancing Act?19. Let us now discuss what more the banking system can do for the region.There are several expectations by the region out of the banking system andthere are several compulsions on the banking system. Further, there arecertain peculiar specialities in this region. A standard response by thebanking system will be to skip these. In my opinion, the banking system9should, instead, find a fine balance between managing these peculiaritiesand adhering to set best practices.- First of course, is that the region expects continued support from the banksfor its growth lead to be maintained. That is, the region expects to maintainthe more than 100% CDR. While the banking system will be willing to bepartnering this, it will have to do so by balancing the expectations from therest of India.  Every region competes for greater flow of credit and financialservices and the banking system has the responsibility in addressing this.- Second, this region is susceptible to vagaries of nature and natural calamitiesstrike this region in a severe way, affecting especially the agricultural sector.Maintaining steady flow of credit to the agricultural sector is a challenge.Complicating this is the ineffectiveness of agricultural insurance.  This regionhas the peculiar, but popular, habit of gold loans smothering the agriculturalloans. In that process, the farmers do not get the benefits of agriculturalinsurance. The banking system has to find a solution for this vexed problemof balancing their need to secure their interests vis a vis the protection for thefarmers. I will return to discuss another variant of this gold loan relatedproblems in a minute.- Third, like any other region, this region also wants increased flow of credit forthe Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector. As is well known,despite continuous increase in the bank credit for the MSME sector, theformal credit flow for this sector is very meager compared to the enormousnumber of units in this sector and the banking sector should tap the greatpotentials of this sector.  The biggest hurdles facing the banking system areits requirements of documentation, its traditional models of assessing thecredit needs of the MSMEs and many a time, the gap in the attitude andsensitivity of the bank officials. It is heartening to note that the non-bankingfinancial companies (NBFCs) in this region have found a balanced answer toskirt around these hurdles and their flow to this sector has recorded good10growth in recent times. Perhaps, the banking sector can also find such abalance.- Fourth, another speciality of this region is the preponderance of non-formaland informal, but riskier avenues for savings. This region is replete withhistory of the so-called blade companies, varieties of formal and informal chitfunds, ponzi schemes, emu farms and other types of attractive schemes.These schemes have time and again captured the imagination of gullible,and even not-so-gullible people of this region, very often lured them intolosing their hard earned savings. These ever running episodes only clearlyestablish the failure of the formal financial system, including the bankingsystem, in catering to the savings, investment and risk taking needs andappetite of these masses. They very pithily indicate that there are savings tobe mobilised in an orderly manner; and there are people whose risk appetiteis more than ordinary or normal and the formal financial system can offerthem well regulated risky financial products. The banking system shouldcome out with innovative and customized savings and financial products.This way they can balance their business opportunities with the niche needsof these people in the region.- Fifth, another speciality of this region is very note worthy and heartening.That relates to the number of Self Help Groups (SHGs), especially of thewomen which operate in this region. In fact, the southern region leads byleaps and bounds in this respect. The readiness, the enthusiasm and thededication and discipline of these women SHGs are the backbones of theirsuccess. In the wake of their successes, certain unhealthy practices andcertain overreactions to them had resulted in a slowdown, even in stoppageof credit flow to this segment. Further, quite many SHGs, before they havematured enough to handle credit and finance, have been exposed to credit.Concomitantly, the credit discipline that had been assiduously builtpainstakingly over the years has been ruptured. Restoring that spirit, whileensuring continued flow of credit is another balance the banking system hasto find.11Conclusion20. Now, to conclude, we have seen how the regional economy did aturnaround in the post reform and financial inclusion period as compared tothe pre-reform period; the regional economy has not only posted bettergrowth but also has surpassed certain all-India numbers. We also saw howthe banking system has, by allocating the mobilised resources, contributed tothe steady and sustained economic growth of the region over the last threedecades. We have also seen the role played by the urban cooperative banksand the non - banking financial companies in providing access to financialproducts and services and helping in allocation of credit. Finally, wediscussed some peculiarities and specialities of the region and their impacton the banking operations and how banks need to undertake a tightropebalancing while handling these peculiarities.21. Thank you one and all for your kind attention.&&&&&&&&&&12
