1Future growth drivers : Retail versus corporateGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to be here in theprecincts of one of the premier business schools of India. When Mr. BhusnurMath, an ex-RBI colleague, approached me for this seminar, I must concede itwas the association of MDI with the event that made me accept the invitation.The way the world is changing and becoming more complex, newer challengesare being thrown up necessitating more interaction and dialogue betweenacademia and the policy making institutions. We, as the central bank andregulator of the financial system, surely realize the significance of suchassociation. Our entire regulatory approach has evolved into an inclusiveconsultative process, with formal association of many academicians as membersof various working groups and committees. This approach has benefited usimmensely and we intend to improve upon the consultation process in future.In today’s session, I have the onerous task of carrying through the most difficultsession in any seminar - the post lunch session. Banking is undergoinginteresting times in India and I hope some of vibrancy evident on the ground getspermeated to the deliberations in this session.Over the last decade and a half, the banking sector has undergone a phase ofintense churning, triggered by the initiation of the reform process in earlynineties. Today, we find ourselves at a stage where the banking environment isunderpinned by:• sufficient operational flexibility for banks, which ensures decision makingon a commercial basis,• increased competition for banks on both assets as well as liabilities side,• emergence of other non-bank financial intermediaries,• technology-aided proliferation of different service platforms                                                1  Address by Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor ata seminar at MDI, Gurgaon on December 3,2005.• integration of a risk management culture within the strategic frameworkwith availability of various risk management instrumentsThe theme for this session is clearly a reflection of the changed times, whenretail/corporate businesses are being talked about as viable businesspropositions and future ‘growth drivers’.Retail banking is becoming an increasingly complex concept to define. While“pure” retail banking is generally conceived to be the provision of mass marketbanking services to private individuals, it has been expanded over the years toinclude in many cases services provided to small- and medium sized businesses.Some banks may also include their “private banking” business (i.e. services tohigh net worth individuals) in their definition of retail banking. The advantages ofa retail franchise are numerous:• Retail banking clients are generally loyal and tend not to change from onebank to another very often;• Interest spreads are wide, since customers are too fragmented to bargaineffectively; Credit risk tends to be well diversified, as loan amounts arerelatively small;• There is less volatility in demand and credit cycle than from largecorporates;•  Large numbers of clients can facilitate marketing, mass selling and theability to categorise/select clients using scoring systems/ data mining.Nevertheless, there can be some drawbacks in retail banking which have to beconsidered:• There can be problems in managing large numbers of clients,especially if IT systems are not sufficiently robust;• Rapid evolution of products can lead to IT complications;• The costs of maintaining branch networks and handling largenumbers of low-value transactions tend to be relatively high. (Forthis reason banks are encouraging clients to use cheaperdistribution channels, such as ATMs, the telephone or internet, forthese transactions and reserve the branches for higher added valuetransactions).In India, retail banking has always been prevalent in various forms ever since theevolution of banking. Co-operative banks that have been existence in India forover a century have always had retail thrust. It is only since the mid nineties thatthe term retail banking has been used as a means of reinforcing a consciousforay into this particular line of business. Retail banking today for many banks issynonymous with mainstream banking, with vast sums of money being investedin creating and sustaining a retail brand, further supported by requisitetechnological and staffing support. It is pertinent to ponder about the causes ofthe shift (or increase) of focus towards the retail side. There are severalcompelling reasons that have influenced this shift. They are:• Fear of corporate defaults and NPA computation• Relative safety implied by the mortgage loans• Low credit off take during from the commercial and corporate sectorduring the period 2000-2003 (this trend has reversed, though, over the lastyear and a half)• Lowering of cost of consumer durables and automobiles due tocompetition• Increasing use of credit/debit cards as plastic money• Automation of stock exchange operations, dematerialization• ATMs, direct debit and phone banking as convenience factors•  Advisory services: real estate, investments and insuranceRecent trendsIt would be pertinent to have an overview of the recent trends in the two portfoliosof the banks. Advances made by the commercial banking system as a wholeincreased significantly by 33% in 2004-05. Contrary to the trend observed in thelast few years, the growth in advances far outstripped the growth in investmentswhich was to the tune of 8%. While rising interest rates which was particularlyevident in the G-sec yields, led the banks to unwind their investment positions,the increased pace of the growth in the industrial and services sector aided thecredit buoyancy in no small measure. The most significant component of growth,however, was the banks retail portfolio.Corporate portfolio• Scheduled commercial banks’ non-food credit, on a year-on-yearbasis, registered a growth of 31.5 per cent as on September 30,2005 on top of a base as high as 24.9 per cent a year ago. Demandfor bank credit has been broad-based led by agriculture, industryand housing sectors• Latest available data indicate that credit pick-up during April-August2005 was quite broad-based. The high growth of credit to thepriority sector reflected largely the sharp growth in agricultural creditas well as small housing loans (up to Rs.15 lakh).•  In addition to bank credit, industry has also increasingly relied uponnon-bank sources of funds in recent years. Equity issuancescontinued to be steady during April-September 2005, benefitingfrom buoyancy in capital markets. Mobilisation through issuances ofcommercial papers also remained strong. Funds raised throughexternal commercial borrowings (ECBs), which were large during2004-05, moderated. This was mainly on account of turnaround inshort-term trade credits as oil companies increased their recourseto domestic financingIt is useful for the bankers to track the changing dynamics of the pattern ofcorporate financing. The equity base of the corporate sector, relative to debt,seems to have increased, and many corporates are currently cash surplus,presumably to meet their investment commitments. Besides, the corporates alsohave access to other funding sources, especially external commercial borrowingsand domestic and global capital markets. The Development Finance Institutionshave substantially got subsumed in the banking sector and banks areincreasingly functioning as universal banks. Banks’ lending to households, be itthrough consumer credit or housing loans, has been increasing in the recent pastalong with increases in lending to priority sectors. It may, therefore, beworthwhile for banks, especially those with long history, to review their systemsand procedures for lending and extending other forms of support to thecorporates. An area of concern, in terms of public perception, is that there isunder-pricing of credit risk for private sector corporates while there could beoverpricing of risks in lending to agriculture as well as small and mediumenterprises. There is merit in reviewing the current procedures and processes ofpricing of credit, perhaps through a well structured segment-wise analysis ofcosts at various stages of intermediation in the whole credit cycle.Retail portfolioRetail segment, which witnessed a frenetic growth over 2003-04 seemedto maintain their momentum in 2004-05. Retail advances in absolute termshave increased by Rs. 77,588 crore in 2004-05, and their share in thescheduled commercial banks’ total loans and advances increased fromst st22.0% as at 31 March 2004 to about 23.7% on 31 March 2005. Retailloans registered a growth of 41% as against a growth of 33% in the overallloans and advances of the banking system. Housing finance, logged a50% growth in 2004-05. The other driver of retail loans was ‘OtherConsumer Finance’ which comprises auto loans, loans to professionalsand educational loans etc which recorded an impressive growth of 32.6%during last fiscal. The same trend continued in the first half of 2005-06where the retail loans grew at an annualised rate of 39% as compared to a22% annualised growth of the investments portfolio. The point to be notedis that while growth in corporate advances due to the growth momentum inthe industrial sector is very impressive, retail story continues to hold good.The overall impairment of the retail loan portfolio worked out to 2.8 % in March2005 and compared quite favourably with Gross NPL ratio for the entire loanportfolio, which was 5.1%. Within the retail segment, the housing loans, whichformed around 50% of total retail portfolio, had the least asset impairment at1.9% while credit card receivables had very high impairment at 7.9% in March2005. However, the disconcerting feature in the asset quality of retail portfolio isthat while overall NPA level in the industry has been consistently coming down,NPAs on the retail side point to a contrary trend. Though the increase in theNPAs in the retail segment may not be very substantial as to warrant immediateconcern, NPA levels in the retail segment are steadily inching up nevertheless.This points to the need to exercise caution by the banks in all aspects of retailloans administration.In recognition of the inherent risks in high growth of retail credit, particularly thehousing and personal loan segment, the Reserve Bank cautioned banks aboutthe need to sharpen their risk assessment techniques so as to guard against anyadverse impact on credit quality. As a counter cyclical measure, risk containmentmeasures were prescribed on housing and consumer loans, and the risk weightsin the case of housing loans and consumer credit, including personal loans andcredit cards were increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent and from 100 percent to 125 per cent, respectively, in the Mid-term Review of Annual Policy forthe year 2004-05. Furthermore, keeping in view the sharp increase in credit toreal estate, banks were advised in July 2005 to put in place a Board approvedpolicy with regard to exposure to the real estate sector and to submit disclosuresto the Reserve Bank in separate returns.High mortgage credit growth a concern? The penetration level in housing inIndia is still one of the lowest in the world. The mortgage to GDP ratio is around ameasly 3%; this compares to 51% in the U.S and 12 to 20% in moreeconomically comparable countries.However, experiences in other countries show that any increase in real estateprices is generally preceded or accompanied by a boom in banking credit and/orexpansionary monetary policy or easy liquidity conditions. A subsequenttightening and/or a collapse in the market prices may lead to increased creditrisk. The relationship between the real estate prices and housing loans isrequired to be monitored closely. The long-term nature of the mortgage loans,coupled with very low interest rates, may also affect banks heavily if the interestrate goes up significantly. Further, increased competition may lead to adverseselection, which, in the event of a fall in the real estate prices may expose thebanks to higher levels of risk.  A significant amount of the personal loans couldbe non-collateralised and a source of potential vulnerability in the event ofdefault.Internationally, a view has been emerging that Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV) being adominant indicator of default probability of housing loans, loans with high LTV(say above 80%) could be assigned higher risk weight. The suggestion is basedon empirical evidence from some countries. However, the likelihood of defaultand the gross severity of loss in the event of default are positively correlated withthe LTV, only when all other factors are held equal. Therefore, a more risksensitive capital allocation framework would suggest that LTV should beconsidered as the risk indicator of an individual loan in conjunction with overallcredit quality which is a function of many aspects such as quality of creditappraisal, installment to income ratio, trends in prices of real estate, efficacy offoreclosure laws, purpose of purchasing/constructing a house i.e. whether as aninvestment or for living.The guidelines laid down by RBI for adoption of Basel II norms for CapitalMeasurement and Capital Standards, prescribe differential treatment for variouscounterparties, including retail. All such claims that meet the specified criteriacould be included in a regulatory retail portfolio and assigned a risk-weighted of75%. Among other things, the criteria are intended to ensure sufficientdiversification and containment of concentration of aggregate individualexposures.Issues in Retail bankingOn this issue of retail banking, there is also a need to stress the associatedresponsibilities to be recognized and addressed by the banks, particularly in thearea of transparency in the services provided. Internationally, there is a growingconcern regarding the retail customers being subject to a slew of hidden costs,which constitute a staggering component of banks’ revenues.In recognition of this concern, RBI has recently come out with guidelines forcredit card operations of banks, addressing the issues of transparency in interestrates, wrongful billing, protection of customer rights and privacy, fair Practices indebt collection to ensure a semblance of transparency in their operations.RBI is also in the process of setting up of an independent Banking Codes andStandards Board of India to ensure that comprehensive code of conduct for fairtreatment of customers is evolved and adhered to. There would need to be aformal covenant between a bank and the Board, which would inter alia includethe disciplinary powers of the Board and this document would serve as aRegistration.Also, sharing of information about the credit history of households is extremelyimportant as far retail banking is concerned. Perhaps due the confidential natureof banker-customer, banks have a traditional resistance to share creditinformation on the client, not only with one another, but also across sectors.Globally, Credit Information Bureaus have, therefore, been set up to function as arepository of credit information - both current and historical data on existing andpotential borrowers. The database maintained by these institutions can beaccessed by the lending institutions. Credit Bureaus have been established notonly in countries with developed financial systems but also in countries withrelatively less developed financial markets, such as, Sri Lanka, Mexico,Bangladesh and the Philippines. In Indian case, the Credit Information Bureau(India) Limited (CIBIL), incorporated in 2000, aims at fulfilling the need of creditgranting institutions for comprehensive credit information by collecting, collatingand disseminating credit information pertaining to both commercial andconsumer borrowers. At the same time banks must exercise due diligence beforedeclaring a borrower as defaulter.Finally, outsourcing has become an important issue in the recent past. With theincreasing market orientation of the financial system and to cope with thecompetition as also to benefit from the technological innovations such as, e-banking, the banks are making increasing use of 'outsourcing' as a means ofboth reducing costs and achieving better efficiency. While outsourcing does havevarious cost advantages, it has the potential to transfer risk, management andcompliance to third parties who may not be regulated. A recent BIS Report on'Outsourcing in Financial Services' developed some high-level principles. A basicrequirement in this context is that a regulated entity seeking to outsourceactivities should have in place a comprehensive policy on outsourcing including acomprehensive outsourcing risk management programme to address theoutsourced activities and the relationship with the service provider. Application ofthese principles in the Indian context is under consideration.Ultimately, it’s a question of which business model is adopted by the bank.The opportunities, on either side, may be leveraged by those who aligntheir processes and systems to the requirements of the business. Thecomplexities and risks being induced by technology, competition,innovative products, further deepening of other sectors of the financialsystem would have to be clearly understood and translated into thestrategic focus.II. Going beyondAllow me the liberty to go a bit beyond the intended thrust of the theme. Retailand corporate businesses have surely emerged as distinct, viable businesspropositions, and it is healthy for the economy. However, the euphoria must notcloud the underlying philosophy of banking to ‘intermediate between ‘thosehaving funds and those in need of funds’. There is still a very large section of thesociety that is out of the net of banking services, and hence denied of thebenefits accruing of the same.The annual policy Statement of April 2005, while recognising the concerns inregard to the banking practices that tend to exclude rather than attract vastsections of population, urged banks to review their existing practices to alignthem with the objective of financial inclusion. In many banks, the requirement ofminimum balance and charges levied, although accompanied by a number offree facilities, deter a sizeable section of population from opening/maintainingbank accounts. With a view to achieving greater financial inclusion, all banksneed to make available a basic banking ‘no frills’ account either with ‘nil’ or verylow minimum balances as well as charges that would make such accountsaccessible to vast sections of population.As a long term objective, our collective priority should be to expand bankingservices beyond credit into all the financial products on offer in moresophisticated markets. Today only a few institutions are seriously offeringinsurance, even though it is particularly valuable to the poor; yet death andillness, for example, are major risks for banks making small loans, and inevitablythey charge for bearing that risk.Before concluding, I would like to share with you the findings of a  recent IMFstudy. The study analyses as to what is happening to the risks being transferredby banks though various instruments and concludes  that it is households whichare carrying more of the risks contained in the financial system. As householdstake on more of these risks, they are also being saddled with more complexfinancial instruments. It would be good to think that the process of risk transferfilters out the most toxic elements and offers households a steady accumulationof value, but the chances are that the opposite is happening. Banks have tendedto pool the cheapest (that is, the most heavily discounted) risks into baskets ofassets which they then securitise. Households are not likely to have the time,inclination or ability to evaluate such offerings from banks, and financial advisersand fund managers do not have a good track record of explaining complexfinancial products.We all need to contemplate over the above since, as an individual, the above is abit disturbing.
