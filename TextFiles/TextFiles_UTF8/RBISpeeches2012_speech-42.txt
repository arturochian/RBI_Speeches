Indias Post-Crisis Macroeconomic Challenges  By   ? Deepak Mohanty   I thank Professor Aditi Abhyankar for the opportunity for being a part of such a  distinguished panel and share my thoughts with the young audience. As the future of the  country, you have a great stake in the performance of our economy in a globalised world: the  opportunity it provides, the promise it holds and the challenges we face. Therefore, the focus  of my talk today is on the recent macroeconomic performance of the Indian economy.  As you know the Indian economy experienced an acceleration in growth in the early  2000s which was dented by the global financial crisis, particularly after the collapse of  Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Though the world economy has recovered from the  recession in 2009, it continues to be buffeted by problems. Apart from the uncertainties in the  global economy, Indian economy faces challenges from several other domestic factors.   Against this background, I sequence my presentation as follows. First, I will situate  India in the global economy under the rubric of emerging and developing economies (EDEs).  Second, I compare and contrast the macroeconomic performance in the post crisis 4-year  period of 2008-12 with the preceding high growth 5-year period of 2003-08. Third, I  highlight a few key challenges that the Indian economy needs to overcome to regain its  growth momentum. Finally, I conclude with the conjecture: when can India become a high  middle-income country, for your inquisitive minds to ponder over?  India in the World  The global economic landscape has changed substantially over the past decade with  the share of EDEs in the global GDP rising from about 20 per cent in 2000 to 36 per cent by  2011 in terms of US dollar at market exchange rate. In terms of purchasing power parity  (PPP), the share rose from 37 per cent to almost 49 per cent. Thus, at the current juncture, the  global economic weight is equally split between the EDEs and advanced economies (AEs).  But, what is interesting is that the EDEs will continue to grow faster than the AEs, even  under adverse economic conditions. This will increasingly tilt the global economic balance in   ?

Concurrently, the resilience of growth in the major EDEs such as Brazil, Russia, India, China  and South Africa  popularly known as BRICS  has been at the centre of such an  assessment.   Over the period 2000-11, Indias share in world GDP rose from 1.5 per cent to 2.4 per  cent in terms of US dollar, and from 3.8 per cent to 5.7 per cent in terms of PPP. This  achievement, however, looks small considering Indias large share of about 17.4 per cent in  the global population.    The growth dynamics looks strikingly different when a comparison is made between  the pre-crisis 5-year period with the post-crisis 4-year period. Between these two periods, the  drop in Indias real GDP growth was less pronounced as compared to the fall in global GDP  growth. Thus, despite growth moderation, Indias contribution to world growth rose from  about 10 per cent to almost 16 per cent over the same period (Table 1).

The initial phase of high growth enabled India to raise its per-capita gross national  income (GNI) to cross the threshold of US$ 1025 for the first time in 2008 and be classified  by the World Bank as a lower-middle income country. Subsequently, the per capita income  rose at a slower pace to US $ 1,410 by 2011 during the post-crisis period. While at the current  level, Indias per capita income is the lowest amongst the BRICS nations, it is noteworthy  that successively India has taken less and less number of years to double its real per-capita  2 income: 40 years since 1950-51; 15 years since 1991-92 and going by the current trend, it  1 may take about 10 years to double the real per-capita income by 2017-18 .   Let me now turn to the key drivers of Indias economic growth and the factors leading  to the growth moderation during the post-crisis period after 2007-08.         Pre-Crisis Growth Upswing  India recorded real GDP growth of 8.7 per cent per annum during the 5-year period  2003-08, contributed by all the three major sectors: agriculture, industry and services (Table  2). This marked a significant upward shift in the growth trajectory. While the high growth in  industry and services sector was supported by past reforms and conducive global economic  environment, agricultural growth was partly aided by favourable monsoons. Though the share  of agriculture in the economy is progressively shrinking, it is important to recognise that the  above-trend agricultural growth not only provided some upward momentum to the overall  growth but also enabled domestic price stability by helping to keep food prices low.

From the  expenditure side, the higher economic growth was enabled by a surge in overall investment  rate largely driven by the private corporate sector. Investment was financed mostly by higher   1  See Mohanty, Deepak (2011), Indian Economy: Progress and Prospects, Speech delivered at the  Harvard Business School, Boston on September 27.   3 domestic saving (Table 3). Private sector investment grew on the back of increased  availability of resources reflecting reduction in public sectors draft on private saving  following the rule-based fiscal consolidation. The attraction of higher growth made it easier  to access foreign sources of funding. The corporate sector also generated higher internal  resources through enhancement of its own retained earnings. This was made possible by  greater profitability reflecting improved productivity, lowering of tax rates as well as lower  2 debt servicing costs enabled by lowering of nominal interest rates . The reduction in nominal  interest rates, in turn, was facilitated by the moderation in inflation brought about by prudent  fiscal and monetary policy.   The reduction in the overall interest rate structure also enabled the Government to  reduce its debt servicing burdens, which partly contributed to a step-up in public sector  saving. More importantly, the perseverance with the rule-based fiscal policy under the FRBM  Act 2003 led to significant moderation in all the deficit indicators. Centres fiscal deficit fell  to 3.6 per cent of GDP during the high growth phase from 5.9 per cent during the 1990s. The  primary deficit turned into a marginal surplus. Consequently, public sector saving increased  to 2.9 per cent of GDP during 2003-08 from a dis-saving of 0.8 per cent in the preceding five  years.

This  largely financed the saving-investment gaps in the corporate and the public sector. With the  deepening of the financial sector, there was greater access to bank credit by households,  especially housing finance, which was reflected in the increase in household investment rate.    The overall gross domestic saving rate of 33.3 per cent of GDP during the high  growth phase facilitated the increase in overall investment rate to 33.6 per cent without much  recourse to external borrowings. Concurrently, the productivity of capital was also high as  reflected in the incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) of a shade below 4. Provisional  estimates from the India Productivity Report 2012, suggest an appreciable increase in total  factor productivity (TFP) at the economy level to 1.9 per cent per annum during 2000-2008  from about 0.7 per cent per annum during 1980-1999. Thus, the growth acceleration was  contributed by high domestic saving accompanied by improvement in productivity.   Post-Crisis Growth Moderation  The onset of global financial crisis in 2008 interrupted Indias growth trajectory.  Despite being located far away from the epicentre of the crisis, India could not remain  insulated from the adverse impact of the crisis. The knock-on impact of the global financial  crisis was felt through all the channels - finance, real and more importantly, the confidence  3 channel .  Initially the impact was visible on Indias financial markets  equity prices fell  reflecting withdrawal of global investment, currency depreciated reflecting global risk  aversion, and money and credit markets came under pressures with substitution of external  sources of funding with domestic sources. Reflecting greater global integration, the Indian  4 trade and business cycles had also become increasingly synchronised with global cycles .  Consequently, the adverse impact of external demand shocks was manifested in terms of a  moderation in Indian economic growth from 9.3 per cent in 2007-08 to 6.7 per cent in 2008- 09. Following expansionary monetary and fiscal policy response, growth recovered quickly  during 2009-10 and 2010-11, before slumping again to 6.5 per cent in 2011-12. GDP growth  is expected to be around 6.5 per cent in 2012-13 also.    3  Subbarao, D.

Analysis of the sectoral  composition of growth reveals that the growth moderation during 2008-12 has been driven  largely by manufacturing and agriculture sectors.  On the expenditure side, growth was led by  both private and government consumption expenditure as investment growth moderated.  Productivity growth has slackened as reflected in increase in ICOR to 4.8 from 3.9 in the pre- crisis period.  Domestic saving has moderated driven by significant fall in public sector  saving as government revenue deficit increased.  More worrying has been a sharp  deterioration in household saving in financial assets.    While full saving estimates for 2011-12 are not available, preliminary estimates  suggest that household financial saving has plummeted to 7.8 per cent of GDP in 2011-12  from an already low of 9.3 per cent in 2010-11 as compared with an average of 11.6 per cent  in the high growth phase. In an inflationary environment, households have tried to protect  their real value of consumption by dipping into their saving. Moreover, increasing household  preference for gold has also dented financial saving.   The saving-investment gap has widened which was filled through greater recourse to  foreign saving. This was reflected in the widening of the current account deficit (CAD) to 3.0  per cent of GDP during 2008-12 from 0.3 per cent during the high growth phase. In fact, the  CAD was record high at 4.2 per cent of GDP in 2011-12.   The sharp increase in imports of gold and crude oil  the latter reflecting in parts  increase in global prices and incomplete domestic price pass-through  largely contributed to  the deterioration in CAD.  As much of the gold demand is met through imports, this not only  created leakages from the banking system but also contributed to the widening of the CAD  5 beyond the sustainable level of around 2.5 per cent of GDP . With net capital flows turning  insufficient to finance CAD, there was a drawdown of reserves during crisis years  2008-09  and 2011-12. Reflecting these developments, there was deterioration in external vulnerability  indicators: ratio of short term debt to total debt increased and import cover of reserves fell.  Net international investment position (IIP), another indicator of sustainability of external  position, deteriorated during post-crisis period (Table 4).     5  RBIs Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments for the First Quarter Review 2011-12 estimated that with  GDP growth of 7 per cent, CAD-GDP ratio of about 2.5 per cent is sustainable.   6          Table 4: External Vulnerability Indicators  (Per cent)  Pre-crisis Post-crisis 2011-12   (2003-08) (2008-12)  4  1 2 3    Balance of Payments    23.7  1.

All the  measures of inflation  WPI, CPI and GDP deflator  hovered around 5 per cent. This was  facilitated by the rule-based fiscal policy which enabled monetary policy to effectively focus  on inflation control and expansion of credit in a non-inflationary manner. In line with the  growing investment demand in the economy, non-food bank credit increased significantly  during 2003-08 to 26.7 per cent per annum from an average of 15.4 per cent during the 1990s  (Table 5). Monetary policy gave significant weight to the analysis of sectoral credit growth  and pursued macro-prudential policies to contain overheating concerns in the economy while  at the same time ensuring increasing credit flow to finance investment.  Financial stability  objectives became an integral part of monetary policy making. Money supply growth was  made consistent with the projections of inflation and growth in order to maintain the resource  balance consistent with the needs of a fast growing economy.     7 Table 5: Monetary and Inflation Indicators  (Per cent) Pre-crisis Post-crisis 2012-13   (2003-08) (2008-12) (Latest)  4  1 2 3  Money & Credit   7.1  1.

Even as real lending rate was significantly high, averaging around 7 per cent  per annum, it did not deter private investment as stable inflation reduced inflation risk  premia.  In any case, the real lending rates were lower than the average real GDP growth of  8.7 per cent during 2003-08 and hence was sustainable. More importantly, the substantial  positive rate of return on loans enabled banks to offer significantly positive real rates of  return on term-deposits which helped raise household financial saving (Table 6).

Note: Real rates are derived as nominal rates minus the inflation rates based on WPI and GDP deflators.    8  During the post-crisis phase of 2008-12 while growth generally moderated, inflation  rose complicating the task of monetary management. The Reserve Bank began exiting from  the crisis-driven accommodative monetary policy stance in October 2009, first by phasing out  all the unconventional measures and then raising interest rates. Overall, headline WPI  inflation increased to an average of 7.6 per cent during 2008-12 largely reflecting near double  digit inflation for most months during January 2010 - November 2011 period. WPI inflation  has since moderated to around 7.0 per cent but remains above 5.5 per cent observed during  the pre-crisis period.  Growth moderation, coupled with signs of thawing of WPI inflation  since December 2011, prompted the Reserve Bank to cut the repo rate by 50 basis points to  8.0 per cent in April 2012.   A disaggregated analysis of the sources of inflation during post-crisis period suggests  that the increase in inflation was contributed by more than doubling of food price inflation to  11.8 per cent during 2008-12 (Table 5). This was, in turn, driven by sharp increase in the  prices of protein-rich food items, reflecting higher demand for these items complicated by  inadequate supply response. Fuel group inflation also increased reflecting increases in global  crude prices. The persistence of food price inflation, in turn, widened the divergence between  WPI and CPI based inflation during this period, at times complicating the assessment of  inflationary pressures for monetary policy purposes.          A major factor from the demand side contributing to the persistence of food price  inflation, which caused generalisation of inflation and fuelled inflationary expectations, was  the sharp increase in rural wages. While the share of agriculture and allied activities was only  14.0 per cent of GDP, rural population constitutes 68.0 per cent of total population and  accounts for 52.0 per cent of workforce. Hence, rural demand has a significant impact on  food inflation and thus overall inflation.   The annual growth in nominal wages in both rural agricultural and non-agricultural  sectors almost tripled during the post-crisis period as compared to the earlier high growth  phase. In fact, increase in real wages was significantly higher than the rate of growth of GDP  in the agriculture and allied sector (Table 7).   While this partly reflected labour market tightening as evident in reduction in work  participation rate (WPR), the increase in higher minimum wage for public works under  various government programs could also have contributed to rising real wages during the  post-crisis period. Available information suggests that urban wages have also increased  9 significantly. Hence, food inflation which emanated from the supply side persisted supported  by higher wages.  Thus, it has acquired a structural character in absence of adequate supply  response.   This period also coincided with general increase in food prices globally.

Source: Labour Bureau for data on employment and rural wages.    Overall, despite inflation remaining high, average nominal policy rates were lower at  6.5 per cent during the post-crisis period. In real terms, the policy rates turned negative while  the real lending rates almost halved to around 3.7 per cent during the post-crisis period (Table  6). Despite lower real interest rates, investment has slackened reflecting the role of non- monetary factors in the growth slowdown. While the heightened uncertainties following the  eurozone crisis could have dampened investment climate, the slowdown in investment could  have been partly driven by the high inflation environment itself. Thus, what is desirable is a  low real interest rate environment as an outcome of a low inflation environment for  promoting investment and growth. Concurrently, as highlighted in the RBI Annual Report for  2011-12, there is a need to address other constraints to investment, such as domestic policy  uncertainties and structural impediments in the infrastructure space.  Challenges Ahead  Let me now turn to some of the challenges for the Indian economy to regain the  growth momentum.  First, as the past-experience suggests, rule-based fiscal policy becomes absolutely  important to afford the space for monetary policy to contribute to the improved  10 macroeconomic performance. Fiscal prudence is also required to alleviate the resource  constraints by boosting domestic saving crucial for raising domestic investment rate.   Second, monetary policy needs to focus on containing inflation and anchoring  inflation expectations. This is essential to usher in a low interest rate environment which is  crucial for raising the overall investment.  Third, there is a need to increase agricultural productivity and improve supply  elasticities. Without adequate agricultural supplies, inflation management is going to be a  difficult task, given the transition of a significant part of the population into the consumption  stream.      Fourth, lower household financial saving as observed over the last two years can pose  a resource constraint for growth in coming years. It could be due to several factors, viz.,  entrenchment of household consumption levels, persistently high inflation and consequent  lower real return on financial assets, and increasing popularity of gold as an investment  option. Therefore, control of inflation and improving the real return on financial assets  become important so that growth prospects do not suffer due to inadequate supply of  domestic saving.   Fifth, the current account deficit, recorded at historically high of 4.2 per cent in 2011- 12 is not only unsustainable but also does not augur well for growth potential of the  economy. Increasing vulnerability of Indias external sector can deter confidence of global  investors and impair financial flows required to meet the domestic saving-investment gap.  Therefore, there is a need to improve competitiveness of the domestic economy while  ensuring that the policy environment remains conducive for investment.  In this context, price  stability is also important for exchange rate stability.   Sixth, we often talk about the demographic dividend that some EDEs like India may  enjoy in the medium to long-run. In the absence of reforms aiming at improving the quality of  human capital, such demographic features may not have the desired impact on growth and  development of Indian economy. Policy emphasis on social sector development and skill  improvement is required to help to absorb excess labour from farm sector to industrial and  services sectors.  11  Seventh, India needs to enhance investment in social and physical infrastructure in  order to sustain the growth momentum. Given the limited space for public sector for  infrastructure investment, incentivising private investment in infrastructure is critical.     Eighth, efforts towards easing the access of poor and under-privileged to the organised  credit market need to be intensified so as to enable their participation in growth and  development process. This will raise Indias credit-GDP ratio, which is relatively low by  global standards. As nominal credit grows faster than nominal GDP, the possible inflationary  impact of this process in the short-term needs to be carefully managed.   Conclusion   Let me conclude. The growth acceleration that we have seen over the last decade,  notwithstanding some moderation in the recent years, has propelled India to the position of  the third largest economy globally after the US and China in terms of PPP GDP and has  improved its global ranking in terms of per capita income. However, Indias per capita  income (GNI per capita in current US$) at US$ 1,410 is quite low as compared with other  BRICS such as Brazil (US$ 10,720), Russia (US$ 10,400), China (US$ 4,930) and South  Africa (US$ 6,960).   If India were to progress towards upper-middle income category of countries  as per  the extant World Bank definition of GNI per capita income of more than US$ 4035 at 2011  US$   it has to regain the growth momentum which has been lowered by the global financial  crisis and several domestic challenges, some of which I have highlighted here. With  appropriate policy response, India could emerge as a upper- middle income country by the  middle of the next decade, i.e., 2025. However, the growth process, itself, is not free from  risks and challenges which need to be recognised and addressed as we move along.   Thank you.     12
