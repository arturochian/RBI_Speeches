????Rural Banking: Review and ProspectsDr. Kotaiah, Mrs. Nandita Ray, Mr. C. S. Reddy, Prof. Mahendra Dev andDistinguished guests,I am grateful to the organisers for giving me an opportunity to deliver the firstSmarajit Ray memorial lecture.  Mr. Ray, about a couple of years younger to me inage and a valued colleague in the civil service, had been one of my close friends foralmost four decades.  He was a self-effacing person with courage of conviction inservicing the cause of the poor with great integrity and objectivity.  I also happen toknow his wife, Mrs. Nandita Ray, particularly in terms of her association with theCentre for Economic and Social Studies. Together, they worked for a better societyand the betterment of the downtrodden.   Given his simplicity and humility, it wasdifficult for many to believe that Mr. Ray had been a student of the elite PresidencyCollege, Kolkata; Delhi School of Economics and London School of Economics.  It issaid that he inherited his courage of conviction from his father Mr. Ranajit, who wasalso of the Indian Civil Services.Since this is the first in the series of lectures, I will recall in brief Mr. Ray’smajor achievements.First, and perhaps the foremost is his pioneering role in the development ofwomen’s help groups in Andhra Pradesh, which led the SHG movement to becomethe most impressive mass movement in this area.Second relates to his innovations in the organisation of the drought pronearea programme, specially in terms of people’s participation.Third is his contribution to the programme of “back to school” whichspecifically targetted the children who were school dropouts and majority of whomwere scheduled castes in the rural areas.Fourth, he prepared a useful document on integrated irrigation managementand also helped in resettlement and rehabilitation of the project oustees.                                                ?  The first Smarajit Ray Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor , Reserve Bank ofIndia, organised by the Andhra Pradesh Mahila Abhivruddhi Society, Hyderabad on December 16,2006 at the Centre for Economic and Social Studies, Ameerpet, Hyderabad.1Fifth, he helped to set up the Environment Research and Training Institute,which focused on consultancy, and training in a wide range of environment-relatedissues – perhaps, the first of its nature at the State level.I have been a silent admirer of his contributions and achievements in thesediverse fields.  However, I had a closer interaction with him in my personal andprofessional capacity very recently. He visited Mumbai in March 2005 to attend theSachin Choudhury memorial lecture and at that time, I spent almost a full day withhim, both in my office and at home.  I was deeply impressed by his commitment toissues relating to micro finance.  This prompted me to follow it up with a meetingwith all people concerned with the micro finance movement involving NGOs inAndhra Pradesh at the Reserve Bank of India, Hyderabad in June, 2005. Mr. Rayhelped in organising this meeting, which gave me a deep insight into the issuesinvolved. In a sense, therefore, Mr. Smarajit Ray was a catalyst for my gettingdeeply involved in the matters relating to micro finance and thus, both RBI as aninstitution and I, at a personal level, are, therefore, indebted to him.  This firstmemorial lecture is, thus, our way of acknowledging the inspiration that we derivedfrom his personal conduct and his professional work.Considering the deep interest that he had shown during his life time and therelevance of that work to the RBI, I have chosen to speak on the subject of RuralBanking. After a brief review of the past and recent efforts, the current perceptionson outcomes are noted. I will then mention the national policy directions, followedby, what I would call, New Realities. I will conclude the lecture with a few issues thatneed to be addressed in the days ahead.Review of effortsIt is useful to recall that rural banking was traditionally a monopoly of themoney lenders, till the colonial government enacted Co-operative Societies Act in1904 with a view to making the co-operatives as premier institutions fordisbursement of credit. The Process of a three-tier structure commenced in 1915.Government was also providing agricultural loans usually called Takkavi loans,which have since been discontinued. The RBI Act vested a unique responsibility ofrural credit to the central bank.  All India Rural Credit Survey (1951) of the RBIopined that the co-operatives were “utter failure” in providing rural credit, but added2they had a vital role in agriculture credit.  The Imperial Bank was nationalised asSBI, which was visualised as a vehicle for rural banking.  A rural credit survey of1966 also concluded the ineffectiveness of co-operatives but stressed theimportance of their succeeding.  Many State governments legislated the registrationand regulation of money lenders but with little emphasis on implementation.Nationalisation of banks in 1969 gave a boost to expansion of banks and banking inrural areas.  The Reserve Bank hived off a part of its role in agricultural credit to aseparate national level institution, viz, Agriculture Refinance and DevelopmentCorporation (ARDC) in 1975.  Soon thereafter, a legislation was enacted to createRegional Rural Banks, with participation from Central and State governments andthe nationalised banks, which have their network spread almost all over the country.Subsequently, the ARDC was converted into NABARD, which continued to get thelines of credit from the World Bank.  The World Bank’s lines of credit were, however,discontinued on the ground that functioning of co-operatives had been less thanacceptable.  Simultaneously, the directed credit in the form of priority sector lendingcontinued and the administered interest rate regime lasted.During the reform period, capital was infused into the RRBs and theNABARD.  While the priority sector lending continued, the administered interest rateregime was dismantled.  To make up for the shortfall in the priority sector lending bythe banks, the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) was initiated toensure the envisaged flow of bank resources to agriculture through theintermediation of the NABARD and the State governments.  A system of SpecialAgricultural Credit Plan was also introduced.  Innovations in the area of rural creditincluded Kisan Credit Cards and encouraging bank-SHG linkages.  It may also be ofinterest to note that many District and State Co-operative Banks are yet to meet theapplicable minimum capital requirements.More recently, since 2004, vigorous efforts have been made to more thandouble the credit flow to agriculture.  Emphasis has been laid on sound creditculture, effective credit delivery and appropriate credit pricing.  New instruments forfinancial inclusion such as General Credit Cards and no-frills accounts wereinitiated.  Micro finance programme was intensified and new guidelines for business-facilitator model were issued.  Use of technology for rural banking is beingencouraged.  Special Area Plans for banking in several states such as  Uttaranchal,North Eastern States, Chattisgarh, Bihar and Andaman-Nicobar have been3formulated to suit the local conditions.  In terms of institutional development,consolidation of the RRBs, revamping of the urban co-operative banks as per thevision document, revival of rural co-operative credit structure as per theVaidyanathan Committee recommendations, a plan for restructuring of long-termlending institutions for agriculture, and a revisit to the prescriptions relating to thepriority sector lending are underway.  While a Working Group to review thelegislations of various States in regard to money lending has been formed, anotherWorking Group is looking into the relief measures for the distressed farmers.  Aboveall, as per the Government of India announcement in 2005, it has been decided tosubsidise the commercial banks and NABARD to enable provision of short-termcredit at 7% interest rate to the major segment of the farmers.             In brief, there have been vigorous and determined efforts towardsexpansion of rural credit, especially through rural banking.Current perception of outcomesThe litmus test of any effort is the outcome, and perhaps even moreimportant, the perceptions of the outcomes.  These can be summed up as follows.First, the non-institutional credit still continues as far as rural areas andagriculture sector are concerned.Second, the credit-deposit ratio shows that despite the intermediation ofbanks,  the ratio continues to be low in the rural area.Third, the all-in costs of credit from banks, after factoring in timeliness,transaction-costs, access, etc, appears high for agriculture relative to privatecorporate sector even after accounting for the risks as reflected by the level ofactual non-performing assets.Fourth, the performance of some of the public sector banks in rural andagricultural lending is also inadequate while that of most of the private and foreignbanks is even lower, despite considerable expansion of the scope of priority sectorlendingFifth, credit-system in rural areas finds it difficult to cope with the risingdemands of commercialised agriculture and in any case, there are few credible risk-4mitigation measures for the borrowers resulting in greater distress to the farmers inareas with significant presence of commercial crops.Sixth, while there has been notable progress in micro finance, it is, mostlyconfined to the states with fairly well-developed banking system.  Further, the costof credit at around 20 to 30% also appears high.Seventh, the co-operative credit system is, in most parts, dormant and it iscommented that the three-tier structure helps finance the bureaucracy rather thanbenefiting the farmers.  Similarly, in many parts of the country, RRBs are less activethough in some others they are expanding.Eighth, while there has been significant growth in rural credit in the recentyears, its medium-term sustainability is contingent upon growth in agriculture andimprovements in the institutional settings.In brief, the perceptions on the outcomes of vigorous and varied efforts toexpand the reach of rural banking, seem to be less than expected. Perhaps it is time we ask ourselves some questions.First have our strategies, in terms of institutions and strategic directions, beenflawed all along?  Have we run out of ideas in this regard?  Is our thinking on ruralcredit has fallen behind the emerging realities in the economy?  Is there a need fordistinguishing between the cause and the effect as also between the symptom andthe disease?  Is it lack of credit availability or want of commercial viability ofagriculture that is constraining the credit-flow, or is it a complex combination ofboth?   While we may not be able to answer many of these questions satisfactorily, Isubmit that we need to keep asking these right questions.New Policy DirectionsAnswers to some of the complex questions relating rural credit may be foundin the most recent policy directions.  The National Development Council approved athweek ago “An Approach to the 11 Five Year plan” which contains extensivereferences to the future policy directions.  Some extracts from the document may bein order.5On objectives and challengesth“One of the major challenges of the 11 Plan will be to reverse thedeceleration in agricultural growth from 3.2% observed between 1980 and 1996-97to a trend average of around 2.0% subsequently”.“To reverse this tend, corrective policies must not only focus on the small andmarginal farmers who continue to deserve special attention, but also on middle andlarge farmers who suffer from productivity stagnation arising from a variety ofconstraints”.“A second green revolution is urgently needed to raise the growth rate ofagricultural GDP to around 4%”On financing developmentth“The 11 Plan must ensure that our policies are sufficiently flexible to supportthe development of micro finance.  Interest rates in the micro finance sector have tobe significantly higher than in the banking sector reflecting the much higher cost ofdoing business.  It is important to remember that most micro-finance institutionscharge rates which are much lower than rates charged by money lenders”.On agriculture sector policy“The failure of the organised credit system in extending credit has led toexcessive dependence on informal sources usually at exorbitant interest rates.  Thisis at the root of farmer distress reflected in excessive indebtedness”.“There is evidence that farm debt is increasing much faster than farmincomes and the larger issue of the overhanging debt stock, as distinct from creditflow, has not even been on the agenda except of a few State governments.Admittedly, there are limits to the extent that banks can be expected to play a purelysocial role in today’s more competitive environment.  However, too conservative anapproach on settling debt that has turned bad, due to contingencies of poor weatheror prices, is not even prudential banking if this serves only to show bank balancesheets to be better than they are, and prevents profitable new lending.  There areseveral suggestions, ranging from a Stabilisation Fund to be run by the Centre forautomatic write-off under some specified conditions, to the setting up by States of6standing professional Debt Commissions to examine individual debt (including tothnon-institutional sources) on a case-by-case basis for one time settlement.  The 11Plan will examine in details the impediments which now stand in the way of socialand developmental banking and suggest innovations that can improve access andspeed up one-time settlements while maintaining credit discipline and financialprudence”.“As farmers adopt new and untried technology, and increase input intensities,they also face larger risks.”“These and related issues of risk management are again largely non-planthareas but need to be addressed during the 11 Plan.  This should ideally be doneby concentrating on innovations in design which could help expand insurance in amanner that is financially viable without excessive subsidy.”It is also useful to extract some of the statements of Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh, on the subject in the meeting of National Development Councilthon 9 December 2006.th“The 11 Plan must give top priority to redressing the weaknesses in theagricultural sector.  Growth in the agricultural sector has been less than 2% perannum since the middle of the 1990s.  With about half of the rural population stilldependent on it for most of their income we cannot expect inclusive growth if we donot revitalise agriculture.  It is important to recognise that the problem is notdistributional, with the better off farmers doing well while the small farmers and thelandless face hardships.  Though the weaker groups clearly face more difficultiesand need special attention, agriculture as a whole is in crisis.  We should, therefore,focus on achieving higher productivity and incomes for all farmers in both crop andnon-crop agriculture.”“The Approach Paper calls for corrective action in several dimensions ofagriculture.  Water is a critical input for agriculture and we need to re-examine allaspects of the water economy.  We are not spending enough on irrigation and whatwe are is not being utilised efficiently.”“In addition to investment in irrigation, we must take steps to conserve waterand promote artificial recharge in rain fed areas.”7“Other issues on the agriculture agenda identified in the Approach Paperrelate to the need for focused research in specific crops, farming systems and dryland farming practices, improved extension work to close the knowledge deficitaffecting farm productivity; better seeds and inputs; enhanced facilities for credit,including revamping the co-operative credit system; initiatives to support agriculturaldiversification with effective marketing solutions; and completing the unfinishedagenda of land reforms etc”.The four deficitsBefore concluding this section, I would like to invite your attention to land-ndmark observations made by the Prime Minister in his address at 2 AgricultureSummit on October 18, 2006, wherein he develops the four deficits theme.“When we review our agricultural situation, it is clear that there are fourdeficits we need to bridge.  These four deficits are (i) the public investment andcredit deficit; (ii) the infrastructure deficit; (iii) the market economy deficit; and (iv)the knowledge deficit.  Taken together they are responsible for the developmentdeficit in the agrarian and rural economy.”“However, we need more thinking on the credit front.  While the financialsystem should do more for the credit needs of farmers, we need to raise somequestions.  What do farmers need – a lower rate of interest or reliable access tocredit at reasonable rates?  Is our existing institutional framework adequate formeeting the requirements of our farmers who are a diverse lot?  Do we need tocreate new institutional structures such as SHGs, micro finance institutions, etc, toprovide improved and reliable access to credit?  Or do we need to bring in moneylenders under some form of regulation?  It is necessary that we find answers tothese questions in the near future.“New RealitiesIt is useful to recognise that there are unprecedented structural changes inthe fast-growing domestic economy and rapidly-integrating global economy.  Thesethrow up what may be called new realities but these have to be met         (a) withoutlosing sight of large population currently dependent on agriculture; and (b) themedium-term trend towards lower share of GDP generation in agriculture. Thus,while some short-term actions may be warranted to be sensitive to aspirations and8expectations in rural areas, medium to longer-term strategies have to take intoaccount what may be termed as new realities, though some of them are old realitieswith greater relevance now and in future.  There is some recognition of these in thethApproach Paper to 11 Five Year Plan, to which there was detailed reference earlierin the speech. Kindly let me elaborate on the theme here:First, there is a continuum of agricultural and non-agricultural activities, interms of inputs, outputs, supply chains, etc, in an emerging, highly-commercialisedand globalising agriculture.Second, there is a spectrum of financial services such as deposit taking,lending, insurance, pension, mutual finds, etc, and there exist several financialintermediaries which need to complement and compete with each other    even inrural areas.  Banks and banking are a part of this emerging larger whole of thefinancial institutions and their activities.Third, there is a clear trend towards rural–urban continuum in economiclinkages and the process of integration needs to be facilitated in the interests ofgrowth and equity. Hence, segmentation of these through public policies orprocedures should, at best, be an exception than the rule.Fourth, distinction between productive and non-productive or consumptionend, becomes blurred and in any case, consumption smoothening is essential.  Thecash flow and risk management become more relevant   relative to ensuring andmonitoring end use of funds.Fifth, today’s technology provides immense opportunities to the financialintermediaries to reach a large section of population, assess and price risks better,and minimise transaction costs. Naturally, this would need considerable businessre-engineering.Finally, there are dramatic changes in demand for food and other articles andsupply of related inputs that need to constitute some of the basic elements of a newapproach. These aspects of a new approach have been comprehensively andsuccinctly brought out in a paper by my colleague Dr. Rakesh Mohan, titled “Agricultural Credit in India: Status, Issues and Future Agenda. (RBI Bulletin,November 2004).  I do not want to repeat them here.9IssuesThe new policy directions by NDC and the Prime Minister clearly indicate thecriticality of improving the credit system but rightly position it as one of the fourdeficits that need to be addressed to manage the crisis of stagnation in the Indianagriculture. Agriculture development has to be led by ensuring commercial viability,which has to be enabled by an appropriate credit system.  In other words, credit canbe a substitute for longer-term commercial viability only if a price is paid in thefinancial sector and fiscal sector.  At the same time, costly or inadequate creditsystem may constrain growth and commercial viability.  The main issues in thisregard, therefore, are related to, what may be called, policies complementary tocredit or financial services for upliftment of rural economy.  Illustratively these are:First, fiscal policy could play an enabling role in two ways in terms of (a)targetting the poor for subsidy; and (b) enhancing public investment whileencouraging private investment that would benefit the rural economy.  Perhaps tomake agriculture commercially viable, costs and benefits of continuing with theexisting allocation of resources for subsidising water, power and fertilizer need to beassessed vis-à-vis bestowing focused attention to providing funds for risk mitigation,investments for enhancing supply, ensuring quality and rationalising availability.Second, trade policy, both domestic and external, should facilitatecommercialising of agriculture and thus, enhance the scope for investments.Restrictions to trade within the country at a time when economy is opening up, may,at times, be less than optimal.  As mentioned, the savings in rural areas andagriculture are now transmitted by the banking system to urban areas and non-agriculture, often, for want of commercially viable avenues in rural areas.  Besides,banks have to improve their own risk-assessment, pricing and credit-disbursementprocedures on an urgent basis.Third, major bottleneck is inadequate arrangements for risk mitigation, be it inregard to quality or timeliness of inputs especially seed, fertilizer, water, power orprice of outputs.  The risk mitigation for natural calamities or vagaries of weather isoften discretionary, based on assessment and response of public-policy.  Riskmitigation mechanisms will make credit disbursal also less risky.10Fourth, there are attitudinal aspects that need to be considered.  It is oftensaid that fiscal support to manufacturing industry is called incentive, while similarsupport to agriculture is called subsidy.  It may be worthwhile consideringinstitutional arrangements and incentive framework that would facilitate attitudinalchanges.Fifth, financial sector as a whole, and banking system in particular, may haveto consider paradigm shift in strategies and processes consistent with new thinking,as urged by the Prime Minister and the NDC.  Reserve Bank and the whole ofbanking system stand in readiness to serve this worthy cause of ensuringdevelopment of rural-agrarian economy by integrating it with the vibrant servicesand manufacturing sectors.Let me conclude by thanking the organisers for giving me the opportunity toshare may thoughts on this subject, which affects a major part of our country’spopulation.  I would also like to place on record my deep appreciation of theinitiatives taken by the organisers in instituting the Memorial Lecture Series andwant to assure them of my whole-hearted support to this worthy initiative.Thank you.11
