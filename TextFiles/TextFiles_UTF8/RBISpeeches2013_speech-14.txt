The first of many questions is why this specification of Mainstream FinancialInstitutions,whyabankledmodel?Forthreereasonsinter alia, firstly Bank deposits are guaranteed by the Deposit Insurance Guarantee Corporation and the depositors money remains safe and secure.Secondly,BanksareRegulatedandwellcapitalizedinstitutions subjecttoRBIsdirectcontrolexercisedthroughtheprocessesofonsite and offsite inspections and supervision.

As a prerequisite to the implementation of the DBT, every eligible individualshouldhaveabankaccount.Further,tomakedisbursements at the doorstep through the ICT?based BC model, banking outlets, eitherthroughbrick&mortarbranchesorthebranchlessmode,are requiredinallvillagesacrossthecountry.Forthistosucceed,itis importantthatqualityservicesareprovidedthroughthenewICT?based BC outlets. Therefore, an intermediary low?cost brick?and?mortar structureisrequiredbetweenthebasebranchesandBClocations.This willprovidetimelysupporttoBCoutlets,ensureclosesupervisionofBC operationsandgivethemcredibilityandincreasepeoplesconfidence inBCservices.Hence,bankshavebeenadvisedtoplanforanincrease intheproportionofbranchesthatcoverunbankedareas.Bankshave alsobeenadvisedtoconsidersettingupFinancialInclusionCentres,whichwouldactascentresexclusivelyfocussingoncustomersserviced throughBC's. 21. Tostepuptheopeningofbranchesinruralareas,RBIhasmandated bankstoopenatleast25percentofthebranchesinunbankedrural centres.Tohelpfacilitateinachievingthismandate,bankshavebeen advised to open small intermediary brick and mortar structures betweenthebasebranchandtheunbankedvillages.Theideaisto create an eco?system for ensuring efficient delivery of services, efficiencyincashmanagement,redressalofcustomergrievancesand closersupervisionofBCoperations.Tofurtherencouragethebanksin pursuing this mandate, banks have been advised to consider frontloading(prioritizing)theopeningofbranchesinunbankedrural centres over a three year cycle co?terminus with their FIPs. This is expected to facilitate quicker branch expansion in unbanked rural centres.  22. Along with increasing brick and mortar presence through branch expansion,RBIhasalsoencouragedbankstoadoptotherbranchless modessuchasBCoutlets,othermodessuchasKiosks,off?siteRural ATMs, mobile vans, etc. so as to resolve the last mile connectivity issues.
