Keynote Address1ByA.VASUDEVANToday is a momentous occasion for all of us. We are now at the threshold of a great change – akind of a revolution, so to say,  – in technology for the banking sector.  We have all had theprivilege of hearing a very important and a very purposeful speech of Deputy Governor, Talwar, a few moments ago. I have, therefore, very little to speak on the network as such. Iwould, therefore, dwell on a tangential issue – the one on the impact that INFINET would haveon banking. To this end, I shall touch upon, in brief terms, the probable areas of usage thatINFINET could be put to, the applications that could be routed through the INFINET, and the2. It has been widely acknowledged that one of the biggest bottlenecks in the bankingsystem in the country today is the lack of a system that ensures fast, safe and secure intra-bankand inter-bank communication.  In fact, this deficiency has hampered to a large extent thedevelopment of a modern, integrated payment system. Most of the cases of complaint againstbanks relate to the time taken for transfer of funds across banks and between cities and to thedelays in the collection of outstation cheques. Clearly, the non-availability of a reliablecommunication backbone has been one of the main contributors to this state of affairs. Thefunctioning of the existing terrestrial line networks is hardly optimal in terms of efficiency,although of late, there has been some change in this area for the better. But, the widegeographical spread of branches of banks and the differing terrain of the country necessitate the3. The best solution in the given circumstances therefore, has to centre on the establishmentof satellite based network using VSAT technology. The decision to go in for VSAT technologyis a deliberate choice. For, without it, it would have been difficult to initiate a network, theIndian Financial Network or INFINET as we have now called it. Clearly, it gets the distinction ofbeing a forerunner of an efficient telecommunications backbone for the Banking and financialsector. With the inauguration of this network today, we need to now seriously examine the use towhich it can be put.4. There can be no better measure of success of the INFINET than the facility for quickfunds transfer. Most of you may be aware that the Reserve Bank of India has, over the last few                                                         1 Keynote Address by Dr. A.Vasudevan, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, delivered on June 19,1999 atthe inauguration of the ‘INFINET’ held at the Institute for Research and Development in Banking Technology,Hyderabadsetting up of a reliable communication backbone as an imperative factor.way that banking would evolve with the use of INFINET.ShriLadies and Gentlemen,INFINET AND ITS IMPACT ON BANKINGyears, developed many new products for the benefit of banks which are all aimed at ultimatelyimproving customer service and systemic efficiency. One of this – the Electronic ClearingService (ECS) – is  aimed at effecting electronically, repetitive credits or debits for a largepopulation of customers spread across a large number of branches of many banks. This facility ispresently available in cities. To illustrate, ECS (Credit) is available for a corporate customerbased at Mumbai to distribute, say dividend or interest payments, to his shareholders located atdifferent cities, say, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Nagpur and so on. I am glad to announce that one of the  applications that could be puton the INFINET would be inter-city ECS. Under this proposal, corporate customers at one placecould effect credits to accounts of customers situated anywhere within the reach of coverage ofECS. Intercity ECS would not only result in quick inter-city funds flows, but also pave the wayultimately for paperless funds transfers, and minimise greatly the levels of clearing relatedreconciliation entries at banks.5. Many of you would have noticed that one of the products that is slowly gainingacceptance in recent months is the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Scheme of the Reserve Bankof India. This facility, currently in operation between the four major metropolitan cities would beanother application that could use the INFINET medium. Work is in fact already on at theDepartment of Information Technology to make the EFT software work on TCP/IP platformscompatible with the INFINET. Once EFT takes the INFINET route, funds transfers facilitiesfrom a bank in one city to another bank in a different city would become easier. The time takenfor funds transfers would also be reduced and ultimately pave the way for straight throughprocessing.6. No payment systems could boast of excellence unless funds transfers take place in a on-line basis. In India, we have the banks maintaining current accounts at the various locations ofthe Reserve Bank of India. Managing funds flows at these current accounts and providing fortransfers from one location to another is yet another activity that could be put over the INFINET.We in the Reserve bank are working on the establishment of a Centralised Funds ManagementSystem (CFMS) comprising the Centralised Funds Enquiry System (CFES) and the Funds Management System (CFMS) by the RBI. This would in our view, pave the way for banksto manage their funds with the RBI in a much more efficient manner and also provide theTreasury / Funds departments of banks with latest information on their balances with the various7. A natural extension of the above would be the establishment of a Real Time GrossSettlement System for the country. We at the RBI have done considerable amount of preliminarywork for the setting up of a RTGS system for the country. The main processing system for theRTGS  system is being put into place at the four National Clearing Cells ( NCCs) in themetropolitan cities. While it has to be accepted that a project such as the introduction of RTGSspreads across a few years, it would have to be ensured that RTGS in India would beimplemented in the quickest possible time alongwith the attendant requirements of security andsafety. Our Governor has already announced in the Monetary Policy for the ensuing year thatRTGS would be established within 15 to 18 months. We are working to achieving this goal. InDeposit Account Department offices of the RBI.CentralisedThiruvananthapuram,our view, INFINET would be an ideal medium for transmission of both messages and funds for8. As all of you know, one of the serious weaknesses of today’s payments system relates tothe delays in the collection of proceeds in respect of inter-city cheques. This is yet another areaof activity that could be put on the INFINET in the first phase of implementation of the network.Realisation of cheques sent on collection basis through the National Clearing Cells of the RBIcould be informed through the INFINET, thus reducing the time taken for realisation of cheques. I must add that the requisite hardware and software for this are being provided for at thefour NCCs. This activity, when it picks up, is bound to have a substantial impact on most of thesmall customers of banks.9. Most of the above activities have some relation to the central bank’s functioning with thebanks. We have not left out the areas of usage by banks exclusively, either. Work is already onfor finalisation of the message formats for Interbank applications and the first part of this reportis ready. Once message formats are standardised for use across banks, message transfers for awide variety of applications that take place between banks would take place effectively,efficiently and quickly. This may also open up facilities for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)between banks and their constituents and perhaps pave the way for the introduction of E-10. Yet another area of interest is the Management Information Systems (MIS). UsingInformation Technology for MIS is ideal and helpful in decision making. Also INFINET helps toprovide facilities for banks for transmitting information on currency chests which would ensureflow of notes and coins as required, INFINET would also provide communication tools forcarrying MIS-based data of banks and financial institutions – both for their own internal usagesuch as periodical statements, data etc., as also for sharing across members critical data such ascredit information of customers at the national level,  linking of ATMs, facilities fortransmission of data for data warehousing purposes, data mining etc. The dissemination ofinformation from the Central Bank to the other members – in the form of circulars, guidelines11. One of the areas that is demanding great attention especially in the IT area is the need foreducating the staff at banks on technology related aspects. I am happy to inform that the IDRBTis planning a series of training courses and distance learning modules based on the INFINET.Thus education and training using the INFINET would thus be another area of value for bankers.12. The introduction of the INFINET as a medium of communication for the banking andfinancial sector in sum opens up a wide array of opportunities for the participants in the field.One could without hesitation , say that INFINET is poised to act as the agent of change for thegood of all of us. It has become imperative for us to act quickly to utilise the INFINET byplacing on it the requisite software and work towards expansion of the capacity of the network.Thank you.and the like could also be through the INFINET.intercityCommerce in the country.intercitythe RTGS system.
