  Modified Draft  Draft Speech for MOS for  Release of RBI Commemorative Stamp on 16/01/10:         Your Excellency Honble President of India, Shri Mukherjee,  Honble Finance Minister, Shri Kamat, Honble Minister for  Communication, Dr. Subbarao, Governor, RBI, distinguished  guests, friends from media, ladies and gentlemen.       It is a great pleasure being here today on this momentous  occasion of release of Postage Stamp commemorating the  Platinum Jubilee year of the Reserve Bank of India. For me,  this occasion is especially significant as we at the Ministry of  Finance, share a very close relationship with RBI.  After all,  what RBI does through its activities touch the lives of all  Indians.   Central banks worldwide have evolved on a continuous  basis in response to changing political and economic forces  around them.  Reserve Bank of India too has traversed a  challenging voyage.  Set up in 1935, it has had a very eventful  run.  As Independent India stepped out from the nascent to the  modern stage, RBI too got fully drawn into the ethos of the  national mainstream and has ever since been playing an active  role in the building up of the nation.     RBI has also over the years been able to sustain high  levels of professional standards in its dealings with the public  and the financial community.  In fact, if our countrys economy  has been able to effectively and successfully deal with major  developments and crises through these years, including in the  face of the recent financial meltdown, RBI can justifiably claim  considerable credit for it.  Indeed, now there is widespread  unanimity that the RBI is technically competent and  professionally equipped to handle financial and economic  upheavals like the ones currently buffeting the global systems. This is more so as central banks in emerging  economies like India have to contend with several objectives,  and distinct trade-offs as compared with some developed  countries which pursue a single objective of price stability.  While pursuing multiple objectives, and managing complex  trade-offs, a central bank like the RBI had to assume over the  years the responsibility of looking after the interests of several  agents including depositors, intermediaries, government,  business, and external trade. Another striking feature of RBIs  role relates to its active involvement in the institution building  process in the Indian financial sector and, in more recent  times, its critical role in development of financial markets in  India.      Needless to say, inspite of taking several initiatives in  the post, the Indian Banking Industry has been able to  penetrate only a half of the population for easy and cheap  access to institutional credit facilities.  In this context, RBI has  taken a number of steps in the recent past which will further  the process of financial inclusion. Its efforts in adapting to the  changing needs of the economy and enabling greater access to  financial services to the unreached and under-reached  segments of our population have been particularly  praiseworthy. This exercise of financial deepening would have  to be supplemented with inclusive growth. There are in fact  few, if any, instances of an economy transiting successfully  from an agrarian system to a post-industrial modern society  without broad-based financial inclusion.   I congratulate the RBI family on this memorable occasion.   I trust you would carry on and in fact improve upon the good  work that you have been doing and enable RBI to contribute  even more fruitfully to the growth and development of our  nation.
