Agriculture Agenda for Odisha – Issues & Challenges
 
Harun R Khan 
 
1. It is a matter of great pleasure to participate in this very important Agriculture 
Conclave organized by the Reserve Bank of India with active support from the 
Odisha University of Agriculture & Technology (OUAT), the National Bank for 
Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD) and the Government of Odisha. 
As you would be aware, both the Reserve Bank of India, Bhubaneswar Office 
and the OUAT are celebrating their Golden Jubilee year – fifty years of 
commitment to the development of the economy of the State, in general, and 
agriculture, in particular. Commitment of the Reserve Bank towards providing 
impetus to the agriculture sector of the State can be judged from the fact that 
way back in 1962, we started our operations in Bhubaneswar with the lone 
department – the Agriculture Credit Department. The same year also saw the 
birth of OUAT at Bhubaneswar following the recommendations of the 
Planning Commission which had suggested setting up of dedicated education 
centres for agriculture in the country. Two great institutions are working 
towards the same goal with able support of the NABARD and the State 
Government. This conclave is a great example of coming together of all the 
stakeholders, such as, farmers, farmers’ organizations, researchers, banks, 
Reserve Bank, NABARD, NGOs and government departments/agencies for 
the common cause of agriculture development of Odisha. It is perhaps time to 
reassess our strategies, policies and perspectives for continuing the 
momentum of growth in agriculture in the State and I am sure this Conclave 
will provide us the requisite platform to deliberate on issues and challenges 
and also draw concrete action plan for the future.  
 
2. There is no doubt that rural India has to be an integral part of the development 
and the transformation process. Consequently, agriculture policy formulation 
has to remain at the centre of the developmental agenda and inclusive growth 
strategy of the country. In my presentation today, I intend to highlight the role 
of Reserve Bank of India in the agriculture sector, the concerns on 
development of agriculture, recent trends in economic growth and 
development of agriculture in Odisha, outline some of the issues and 
challenges of the agriculture sector in the State in a framework of SWOT 
analysis and end with some thoughts on challenges that lie ahead. 
A. Role of Reserve Bank in agriculture sector for inclusive growth 
   
3. As the central bank of the country, the concerns of Reserve Bank has always 
been to maintain price stability and ensuring availability of credit for the 
productive requirements of the economy. Unlike many other Central Banks, 
since its inception, provision of credit and facilities to the agriculture sector 
has been one of the major objectives of the Reserve Bank of India. This was 
very aptly echoed by our first Prime Minister Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru who had 
emphasized the centrality of agriculture in our economy when he said

 Keynote address by Shri Harun R Khan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India delivered at the Conclave on   ‘Agriculture 
Agenda for Odisha’ on February 24, 2012 at Bhubaneswar. The speaker acknowledges the contributions of Shri. K. K. Gupta, 
NABARD, Bhubaneswar, Shri. B. S. Choudhary, Reserve Bank of India, Bhubaneswar, Shri. Suraj. S and Shri Surajit Bose, 
Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. everything else can wait but not agriculture. In pursuit of the objective of 
inclusive growth strategy, the Reserve Bank has stepped up its efforts to 
promote financial inclusion in recent years by increasing the penetration of the 
formal financial sector. It is critical to increase the coverage of formal finance 
in rural sector, particularly in agriculture, in order to ward off the financial 
vulnerabilities and risks arising from the sourcing finance though informal 
means from money lenders and other similar entities.  The Reserve Bank has 
been taking special initiatives for extending the outreach of banking facilities 
through branch banking and also through host of alternate models. Thus, the 
financial inclusion drive is particularly significant for the State like Odisha for 
achieving inclusive growth objectives as more than 60 per cent of the total 
work force directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture where its contribution to 
growth is declining due to various reasons.  
 
4. Credit availability should be timely and adequate. It is important to note that 
finance is a critical input which can command all other resources required for 
farming. Therefore, the conventional approach of granting crop loans wherein 
farmers approach the banks will not suffice. Bankers will have to play an 
active role in supporting the farmers in several ways, just like they did during 
the heydays of the Green Revolution. In fact, one of the major objectives of 
nationalisation of banks in 1969 was channelising the productive credit to 
agriculture sector.  It is not merely the rate of interest that matters but equally 
important is the issue of number of times a farmer is required to come to the 
bank and the complexities of documentation. While branch banking will 
continue, Business Facilitators (BFs) and Business Correspondents (BCs) 
have to be utilized increasingly to generate incremental business. Reserve 
Bank has been emphasizing that the banks need to increasingly use ICT tools 
to increase their outreach reduces transaction costs and provides built-in 
safeguards in regard to the KYC and the due diligence related issues. 
Simplification of the documentation/ procedure and related public services like 
digitization of land records, electronic search and lien facility would contribute 
to hassle-free delivery of rural financial services. Credit Bureaus will also have 
to come up to provide credit history of the borrowers and, thereby, facilitate 
efficient due diligence of the clients. In fact providing holistic financial services 
covering credit, savings, insurance and remittance on a sustainable basis by 
the formal as well as semi-formal financial institutions has assumed critical 
importance for business growth and profitability of these institutions and 
economic advancement of the target clientele. In short, rural banking is likely 
to see a lot of action and change in the days to come.  It is also important to 
note that besides financial services, host of complimentary policies and 
resources are necessary for sustainable development of the agricultural 
sector and the farmers under Credit Plus approach. 
 
 
B. Recent Trends in Growth of Odisha 
 
All India Perspective 
5. Given the large scale dependence of the population on the agriculture sector, 
Odisha remains primarily an agrarian economy. The Net State Domestic 
Product (NSDP) of Odisha accounted for around 2.3 per cent of the all-India 
Page 2 of 18 
 2
net domestic product (NDP) during 2010-11 . Over the five year period 2005-
06 to 2009-10, the NSDP growth in Odisha increased to 7.9 per cent vis-à-vis 
6.1 per cent in the preceding five years. The growth was mainly led by strong 
services sector growth along with support from agriculture sector. During 
2010-11, NSDP growth declined sharply to 2.2 per cent, recording the lowest 
growth amongst all the States in that year, and was in contrast to the trend in 
the all-India NDP growth (Table 1). Unlike at the all-India level, in the case of 
Odisha, the share of agriculture sector is higher than that of the industrial 
sector in NSDP.

Regional perspective 
6. From the regional perspective, the NSDP of Odisha grew at faster pace than 
that of the other Eastern States as a whole in 2009-10 mainly on account of 
accelerated growth in agriculture and services sectors. In terms of share to 
NSDP, the position of the Odisha as compared to the Eastern States as a 
whole and all-India level was higher in the case of agriculture and industry, 
while it was lower in the case of services sector (Table 2).

C. Concerns on development of agriculture   
 
Global context 
7. Today, agriculture is a cause of global concern in the context of (a) price 
volatility with a rising trend, especially of agricultural commodities, (b) growing 
concerns for food security and resultant trade restrictions, (c) global economic

 conditions in the recent past, (d) the forecasted rate of reduction of growth of 
agricultural land over the next two decades, (e) increasing mismatches 
between supply of agricultural products for food, feed & fuel in relation to 
growing demand  and (f) the climatic changes which are exerting pressures 
on agricultural production. Thus, enhancing agriculture production and 
productivity have emerged as a global challenge and this is more severe for 
low income and developing countries. 
 
Indian context 
8. India, with 2.4 per cent of the world’s geographical area, is the largest 
producer of pulses, tea, and milk and second largest producer of fruits, 
vegetables, wheat, rice, groundnut and sugarcane in the world but supports 
about 16.2 per cent of the world’s population. Coupled with small scale land 
holdings and deep rooted poverty in rural areas, the magnitude and 
dimensions of challenges for agriculture policy-makers have increased 
manifold. In the context of 2 – 3 per cent growth in the agriculture sector in the 
th th
last 15 years (2.5 per cent in the 9 Five Year Plan, 2.4 percent in the 10 
th
Five Year Plan and around 3.2 per cent in the 11 Five Year Plan), the target 
th
of 4 per cent growth in agriculture set for the 12 Five Year Plan  underscores 
the importance of agriculture to the economy of the country. 
 
9. Our Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh had very aptly identified four key 
deficits afflicting Indian agriculture, namely, Knowledge Deficit, Infrastructure 
Deficit, Public Investment and Credit Deficit and Market Economy Deficit. The 
declining contribution of Indian agriculture has been attributed to various 
factors including stagnation in yield levels, limited introduction of new varieties 
of seeds and crops, lack of technological breakthrough for productivity 
increase in the rain-fed areas, absence of effective risk mitigants for price, 
production and personal risks for the agricultural sector, etc. Another plausible 
reason is the deceleration in public and private sector investment particularly 
in agriculture although in recent time, gross capital formation in the sector has 
increased. This decline is one of the main factors for stagnation in agricultural 
production, and thereby poverty in rural areas. Low level of value addition and 
insufficient focus on agro-processing together with inadequate marketing 
linkages, particularly for the small and marginal farmers, have also contributed 
to the declining contribution. Many studies have also highlighted that 
fragmentation of land, low technological inputs, unsustainable water 
management and resource utilization, rising pressure of population on land, 
land degradation alongwith low level of mechanization, fertilizer consumption, 
etc. are some of the critical causes of concern for the agriculture sector of 
India.  
 
Agriculture in Odisha   
10. Though the agriculture sector of Odisha contributes only around 20 percent 
towards State Gross Domestic Product (GSDP), it provides employment and 
sustenance, directly or indirectly, to more than 60 percent of the total 
workforce of the State. In this sense, the agriculture sector is still the mainstay 
of the economy of Odisha. According to the Economic Survey 2010-11 of 
Odisha, despite wide annual variations in its growth, the agriculture sector has 
grown at an average annual rate of 4.8 per cent in the first three years of the 
th
11 Five Year Plan. 
Page 4 of 18 
  
11. The real per capita income of Odisha was ` 24,356 in 2010-11 which was 
around 68 per cent of All-India real per capita income of ` 35,917. According 
to the 64th round of NSSO, the monthly per capita consumer expenditure 
3
(MPCE) for rural and urban Odisha is below the respective national 
averages. The Engel’s ratio (which measures the share of food expenditure in 
total expenditure and has been widely used as an indicator of the standard of 
living) for Odisha, both in rural and urban areas, is generally higher than the 
all-India level. In the food and non-food consumption behaviour, an average 
Indian spends more than an average person in Odisha. According to the latest 
India Human Development report, the ranking of Odisha remained as the 
second lowest among all the Indian States  for a period 1999-00 to 2007-08.  
 
12. In short, the above parameters pinpoint that the State of Odisha has been 
lagging behind the national economy and highlights the necessity of achieving 
higher growth on a sustainable manner across the sectors particularly the 
agriculture sector in order to uplift the society from underdevelopment and 
poverty. Though the contribution of agriculture to NSDP has declined, the 
percentage of workforce engaged in agriculture has remained somewhat 
unchanged. This implies that (a) there has been an overcrowding in 
agriculture without any perceptible increase in production and (b) there has 
been an increase in disguised unemployment or underemployment in the 
agriculture sector with zero or near zero marginal productivity of agricultural 
labour.  
 
Agriculture production in Odisha 
 
13. Odisha is an agrarian state with 70 per cent of the population of the State 
dependent on agriculture. The State has about 64.09 lakh hectares of 
cultivable area out of a total geographical area of 155.71 lakh hectares, of 
which 60.18 lakh hectares is the net area sown. As mentioned earlier, 
agriculture contributes about 20 per cent of the Net State Domestic Product of 
the State (Table 3).

Rice  
14. With 6.9 million tonnes of rice, the State stood fifth in rice production during 
2011-12. This constituted 6.7 per cent of the total production of 102.7 million 
tonnes in the country as against 5.4 per cent and 7.8 per cent during 2000-01 
and 2004-05 respectively (Table 4). The trend in rice production in the State 
showed that though production of the crop has increased in absolute terms 
over the years, its share at all-India level has declined in recent years. This 
can be possibly attributed to higher growth of production of rice in other parts 
of the country. In recent years, area and yield of rice in the State has lagged 
behind the all-India levels. Area under rice declined by 3.0 per cent during 
2010-11 and yield by 2.2 per cent during 2011-12.

Pulse   
15. In recent years, production of pulses have picked up more significantly than 
other crops in the State. The State produced 0.4 million tonnes of pulses 
during 2011-12 constituting 2.5 per cent of all India production of pulses 
during the year. The State produced around 0.2 million tonnes of pulses 
during 2000-01 and 2004-05, constituting around 2.0 per cent of all India 
pulses production for the respective years. During 2010-11 and 2011-12, area 
under pulses cultivation in the States had declined while yield has marginally 
increased.    
 
D. Issues & challenges of agriculture sector in Odisha 
 
16. Let me now highlight some of the macro and micro factors posing challenges 
to the sector in the State. The macro factors include lack of sustained growth 
in the primary sector, instability of the food grain markets in terms of access & 
price and lack of basic infrastructure. The micro factors include lack of access 
Page 6 of 18 
 to and control over resources such as land and common property resources 
like water, forest and public lands, degeneration and degradation of land and 
forest resources, lack of capacity development and structural support for 
entrepreneurship.  
 
17. Despite several policy measures, Odisha remains one of the most 
agriculturally backward states of India. Agricultural productivity in Odisha 
remains quite low due to traditional farming practices, low use of high yielding 
variety seeds, chemical fertiliser, organic manure; uneconomic size of 
operational holding, incidence of high tenancy, low capital formation and 
investment in agriculture, inadequate rural infrastructure and services and 
inappropriate policy environment. The low application of two important yield 
enhancing inputs like irrigation and fertiliser are considered to be the most 
immediate and important determining factors responsible for low agricultural 
productivity in Odisha.  
 
18. In brief, agricultural development of Odisha is faced with several challenges 
which are more or less common with issues being faced at the national level 
except in certain areas. Thus, the SWOT analysis of agriculture in Odisha 
would reveal both common and idiosyncratic features (Exhibit 1). I would 
briefly dwell on a few of the features relating to weaknesses and threats.

 Poor land utilization pattern and soil quality 
19. Over the period of 10 years between 1999-2000 and 2009-10, the total 
cultivable area has reportedly gone down from about 72 lakh hectare to 68 
lakh hectare, with net sown area reducing from 61 lakh ha to 56 lakh ha. The 
current fallow lands, however, have grown from 6.8 lakh ha to 8.35 lakh ha 
during this period. About two thirds of the cultivable land is acidic with varying 
degree of acidity. Further, about seven per cent of the cultivable land is 
affected with salinity. Despite 117 per cent growth in area under irrigation 
during the same period and average cropping intensity having gone up from 
137 per cent to 163 per cent, there is overall stagnancy in gross cropped area 
as also the agricultural production and productivity in the State.   
 
20. Present infrastructure for soil testing is grossly inadequate and farmers do not 
have a culture for undertaking soil testing. The process of deterioration of the 
quality of soil is further hastened by unscientific usage of fertilizers. This 
clearly underlines the need for one-stop solutions for soil testing, diagnosis 
and amelioration advice to farmers. There is a strong case for encouraging 
setting up of agri-clinic & agri-business centres by private entrepreneurs. Also, 
organic and green manures have to be encouraged to make up the stagnant 
supply of chemical fertilizers. Various projects to encourage composting and 
linkages for production of green manures, bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides 
have to be supported by various agencies of the governments and banks. 
 
Preponderance of small/marginal size of land holdings  
21. The agriculture sector in the State is characterized by the preponderance of 
small/marginal farmers/agricultural labourers with more than 86 per cent 
farmers holding land less than 2 hectares and 60 per cent of the farmers 
having less than 1 hectares land or no land at all. As per the latest available 
figures of Agricultural Census, about 26 lakh marginal farmers (constituting 60 
per cent of farmers) are holding 33.50 lakh acre land (constituting 27 per cent 
of total land) with an average of around 1.3 acre land per holding. Similarly, 
11.60 lakh farmers in the small farmers category hold about 40 lakh acre land 
(constituting 31 per cent of total land). Thus, 58 per cent of the land is held by 
86 per cent farmers while the rest about 6 lakh farmers (constituting 14 per 
cent of total number of farmers) hold about 52 lakh acre land (constituting 42 
per cent of total land) with an average of about 8.67 acres. This indicates 
towards the skewed assets distribution of land and calls for appropriate 
strategies in favour of the small and marginal farmers.  
 
22. The situation is further aggravated by the rising land fragmentation on account 
of disintegrating family systems in rural Odisha and continuing dependence of 
large population on the sector. Thisis a pointer towards the need for 
legislation to check large scale land fragmentation in near future. The small 
land holdings also lead to low levels of risk taking capacity, technology 
adoption, farm mechanization and fertilizer application, resulting in low levels 
of investment as also the low farm productivity. 
 
Low level of crop diversity 
23. The crop diversity is very minimal in the State though some efforts have been 
initiated in some parts of the State. Some farmers are adopting floriculture, 
onion, turmeric and mushroom cultivation as a diversification away from

 traditional crops. The diversification in crops, however, is suffering from 
inappropriate market linkages, lack of infrastructure like cold storages/onion 
storages/rural godowns, etc. despite the Government of India Scheme for 
supporting Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure. As on date there are only 
around 300 rural godowns/storages set up under this scheme in Odisha with 
limited storage capacity with no accreditations (only one storage of Central 
Warehousing Corporation in Rayagada is having accreditation in the whole 
State of Odisha).  
 
Low farm mechanisation – insignificant use of power 
24. Mechanized agriculture is the process of using agricultural machinery to 
mechanize the work of agriculture in order to increase farm output and farm 
worker productivity. The productivity measures warrant intensive farm 
mechanisation which needs to be supported with adequate supply of power 
and other infrastructures. In this context, the low level of consumption of 
power which is critical for mechanisation of agriculture indicates the lack of 
modernisation of the agriculture sector in the State (Table 5).

As maybe seen power consumption for agriculture has been less than two per 
cent against all-India figure of about 30 per cent. 
 
Low level of irrigation  
25. The extent of usage of fertilizers, rainfall, per cent gross cropped area 
irrigated and size of operational holding have a positive bearing on the yield of 
crops. Compared with all India averages, progress in extending areas under 
irrigation in the State has been faster. During 1999-2000, 29.5 per cent of 
areas under all crops in the State were irrigated which increased to 35.0 per 
cent by 2008-09. The respective all-India levels were, however, much higher 
at 40.8 per cent and 45.3 per cent. As regard irrigated area for rice production 
increased from 40.7 per cent to 46.8 per cent during this period as against 
53.9 per cent to 58.7 per cent at all-India level (Table 6).

 Low usage of fertilizers 
26. Fertilizer consumption in the State, in terms of kilogram per hectare during 
2008-09 was very low 61.6 kg as against 128.6 kgs at all-India level (Table 7) 
i.e. Odisha’s per hectare consumption of fertilizer is less than 50 percent of all 
India consumption. Similarly, pesticide consumption in the State is much 
lower than the all-India levels.

Low productivity 
27. Though some of the districts of the State have achieved much higher 
productivity levels, the agricultural productivity remains a matter of concern as 
the productivity of some of the major crops in Odisha vis-à-vis some 
neighbouring states is relatively low (Table 8).

Low capital formation  
28. It  may noted that the share of capital outlay on agriculture in the total capital 
outlay declined at the consolidated States level and, more sharply, in Odisha 
during the second half of 2000s as compared to first half of the decade. The 
declining trend in the share of capital outlay on agriculture in Odisha as well 
as for the consolidated States continued during 2010-11 (RE). The capital 
formation in agriculture remains at around 12 per cent in the State as against 
national figure of around 20 per cent. However, the share of capital outlay on 
agriculture in total capital outlay is budgeted to increase 2011-12 both for 
Odisha and for the consolidated States (Table 9).

 E. Inadequate agriculture financing  
 
Banking network 
29. As at end-June 2011, there were 46 scheduled commercial banks operating in 
Odisha including 25 public sector banks, 14 private sector banks, five regional 
rural banks (RRBs) and two foreign banks. The total number of branches of 
scheduled commercial banks (excluding RRBs) in the State was 2,136 at end-
June 2011. The population group-wise distribution of these branches indicates 
that rural branches accounted for 45.5 per cent of the total number of 
branches in the State, as against their share of 29.2 per cent at the all-India 
level (Table 10).

CD ratio and credit profile 
30. The credit-deposit (C-D) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (excluding 
RRBs) in Odisha stood at 49.2 per cent, at end-June 2011 which was lower 
than at end- June 2010 level and was lower than the all-India level position of 
75.6 per cent. Further, urban branches accounted for the maximum share of 
65.6 per cent in outstanding bank credit of scheduled commercial banks in 
Odisha, followed by semi-urban branches (17.6 per cent) reflecting skewed 
credit flow to the agriculture sector in the State despite preponderance of rural 
branches. 
 
Agriculture credit 
31. As per the latest available data in Odisha, the share of agriculture in the total 
credit deployed recorded an increase to 16.5 per cent from 14.8 per cent as at 
end-March 2010 while the share of industry stood highest at 32.7 per cent 
followed by personal loans (23.8 per cent) during the same period. The flow of 
credit to the agriculture sector during the last decade, however, remained 
highly volatile vis-à-vis the trend exhibited at the national level. This partly 
reflects the unstable agricultural production in Odisha and can be partly 
explained by recurrence of natural calamities like droughts and floods and 
insufficient and inadequate support system (Chart 1).

32. At end-March 2011, the share of priority sector advances in total bank credit 
in the State was 49.2 per cent as compared with 32.8 per cent at the all-India 
level. Within the priority sector advances in Odisha, the share of advances to 
agriculture was highest (41.6 per cent), followed by small enterprises (37.3 
per cent) and housing loans (15.3 per cent). Recovery performance for 
advances to agriculture in the State was lower as compared with the all-India 
position during 2009-10. The percentage of recovery to total demand for direct 
advances to agriculture by all scheduled commercial banks in Odisha 
decreased to 56.5 per cent at end-June 2010 from 63.7 per cent at end-June 
2009. It needs to be emphasized that steady and sustainable flow of credit to 
the sector would critically depend on a healthy credit culture. Recovery 
performance needs and can be improved, among others, if (a) banks take 
proactive steps for continuous and meaningful engagement with the 
borrowers, (b) State machinery plays a proactive role, (c) necessary 
amendments are effected in Odisha Public Debt Recovery Act (OPDR Act), 
and (e) establishment of agri-risk fund. 
 
33. It would be essential for the banks to provide finance for the entire cash flow 
requirement of the farmer family – both short term and long term purposes 
and for purposes such as debt swap and for other personal and business 
requirements. It is also necessary that banks look at opportunities for 
financing agri-business entities, niche agriculture, allied sectors and supply 
chains for strengthening forward and backward linkages. Here a critical factor 
would be the availability of trained and committed manpower with the 
financing institutions and visible thrust and commitment of senior 
management of these institutions rather than mere stress on achievement of 
the targets.      
 
34. Another aspect of urgent relevance in the State is the lack of access of the 
bank credit to the tenant farmers and oral lesses. Andhra Pradesh and West

2010Bengal have taken initiatives for making the tenant farmers/ oral lessees 
eligible for bank credit through joint liability group (JLG) mode and Licensing 
Mode. Though the JLG movement has picked up in the State yet it is 
observed that the off-take of credit by such JLGs is still not substantial enough 
and the JLG farmers are able to access small amount of loans only and the 
landless people are being given loans on no-farm activities rather than in 
proportion of the land they cultivate on account of the fact that their land 
cultivation is not being recognised in absence of any records of their tillage.  
 
F. Way forward 
 
35. Having highlighted some of the major issues and challenges facing the State 
for developing the sector, let me try and suggest a broad framework which 
may form the way forward for enhancing agriculture production and 
productivity in the State and income level of farmers and make the sector 
viable and sustainable. The strategy should, among other things, focus on 
improving upon the existing crop system, diversification of crop pattern and 
curing the less fertile lands. The strategy should also be aim at addressing the 
issues related to supply management of critical inputs like seeds and 
fertilisers, appropriate cost effective farm mechanization, appropriated post-
harvest arrangements to tackle incidence of distress sale and ensuring 
adequate flow of credit. We may also consider adopting models for 
synergizing the efforts of farmers, more particularly small and marginal 
farmers. One such approach could be a congregation model which ensures 
grouping of farmers, particularly the small and marginal farmers, who do not 
have individual capacities by way of producer companies/co-operatives/ 
JLGs. 
 
36. For providing the much needed momentum to a new Green Revolution in the 
State, a framework based on the acronym F.A.R.M.E.R. could be considered. 
Each letter of the word has a linkage, direct or indirect, to the livelihood of the 
farmers and development of agriculture (Exhibit 2). 
 
Page 14 of 18 
 Exhibit 2: Framework based on F.A.R.M.E.R. 
Credit availability should be timely and adequate. It is not only credit but also a 
holistic package of financial services including credit (production and post-
production), savings and insurance that needs to be kept in view. It is important 
F 
to note that finance is a critical input which can command all other resources 
Finance 
required for farming. Besides crop loan, investment credit would be very critical 
for long term sustainability of agriculture. 
It is through increased income of the farm families through diversification (for 
example, a milch cow provides a daily cash flow to the household which can 
A 
sustain them in the periods of distress arising out of crop loss). Allied activities 
act as a hedge against the downsides in agriculture. It is also imperative to 
Allied activities 
encourage mixed/integrated farming. 
Risk mitigation measures against price, production and personal risks like crop 
and weather insurance, health insurance, etc. are very critical for maintaining 
the health of the rural financial system and ensuring the viability of the 
agricultural sector. Some of these can be bundled and provided as a package to 
R 
the farmers as micro insurance. Contract farming, corporate farming and 
producer companies are some of the models of congregation, integration and 
Risk Mitigation 
linkages which should be explored to safeguard the interest of small and 
marginal farmers. Crop diversification/mixed/integrate farming and effective 
extension support are also essential for risk mitigation. 
Efficient marketing which would include innovative approaches, such as, the 
Producer Companies, Contract Farming, Value Chain Agro Processing and Agri-
M 
Business are particularly important for the small and marginal farmers.  Price 
support system would also play a critical role in ensuring remunerative return to 
Marketing Access 
the farmers. 
Research and extension linkages should comprise of all the four critical pairs of 
L's Lab to Land, Land to Lab, Land to Land and Lab to Lab. It needs to be 
appreciated that the quality extension and research services in a cost effective 
E 
manner is a sine qua non for productivity enhancement and risk mitigation. 
There is a great scope to bring about convergence among the schemes/efforts of 
Extension & research 
several agencies, both public and private, banks and NGOs and using ICT based 
solutions for meaningful extension activities. 
Timely and adequate availability of other critical resources other than finance, 
i.e., inputs like water, seed, healthy soil, fertilizer, pesticides, farm implements, 
R 
storage and warehousing facilities and skilled and productive human resources, 
Resources other than 
efficient supply chains, etc. are very important to ensure that agriculture 
finance 
remains a remunerative and attractive vocation.  
 
37. As this Conclave has stakeholders from Government, government agencies, 
financial institutions and research institute, I shall be highlighting the criticality 
of one of the components, i.e., ‘R’ which pertains to resources other than 
finance. This component broadly encompasses seed related issues, 
extension systems, soil health, farm mechanisation, etc. In this context let me 
highlight a few important issues. 
 
Extension system 
38. The State of Odisha has several premier institutions for undertaking research 
but the Agricultural Extension System in the State remains in almost a 
dormant stage. Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVKs) and the Rural Self Employment 
Training Institutes (RSETIs) are established and in existence in almost all 
districts. Yet the effective technology extension and adoption is rather limited. 
The existing system of State Extension Machinery has its limitations of 
outreach and financial resources and not many efforts have been made for 
creation of local skills for technology dissemination. Hence it is important that 
the alternative/supplementary extension systems are encouraged. The 
digital/electronic/space technology/mobile telephone systems of providing 
Page 15 of 18 
 technology and periodic advisories to farmers have to be examined for cost 
effective adoption. I would urge the sub-committee of the SLBC set up in this 
regard should come out early with a monitorable action plan for holistic 
extension support to the farmers. 
 
Seed related issues 
39. There is an urgent need to design a seed availability program which will 
include adequate seed replacement strategies, ensuring timely availability of 
seeds of desired variety in required quantity and finance to seed producers. In 
order to encourage decentralized production of seeds, authorities may 
consider setting up of local exchanges and enabling NGOs to play a greater 
role. Commercial banks should provide higher scales of finance to the seed 
growers owing to larger cost involved. They should also consider working 
capital/term loans for seeds processing and marketing societies of farmers or 
the NGOs promoting such seed production/processing/marketing. 
 
Soil health and nutrition 
40. It is a fact that the present infrastructure for soil testing is grossly inadequate 
and farmers do not have a culture for undertaking soil testing. The 
consumption of fertilizers is often low and not backed by findings of scientific 
soil testing reports. To incentivise development of such a culture use of 
Kishan Credit Cards could be linked to Soil Health Cards. Thus, there is a 
need for one-stop solutions for soil testing, diagnosis and amelioration advice 
to farmers. There is a need for the PACS to play an important role in this 
regard apart from encouraging private agri-clinics & agri-business centres. 
Organic manures and green manures have to be encouraged to make up the 
stagnant supply of chemical fertilizers. Various projects to encourage 
composting and linkages for production of green manures, bio-fertilizers and 
bio-pesticides have to be supported by the State Government and the 
financial institutions. 
 
Farm mechanisation  
41. The data on farm-hands availability indicates declining availability of farm 
labour. The productivity measures also require extensive farm mechanisation 
both for the small implements as also capital intensive big farm machines. As 
small farmers may not be able to afford individual ownership of farm 
machines, group models or the custom-hiring models need to be considered. 
PACS can be considered and developed as Farm Mechanisation Hubs to 
provide farm machines to its members on hiring basis. The Farmers’ Clubs, 
Village Watershed Committees/Wadi Committees should also be encouraged 
for creating their own farm machines hubs. After-sales services for farm-
machines are abysmally poor in most of the parts of the State. Individual 
trained entrepreneurs have to be encouraged to take up farm-machines 
servicing enterprises. Banks need to encourage financing of various small 
farm machines rather than restricting financing to big farmers for tractors and 
power-tillers.  
 
Irrigation 
42. Irrigation is largely a State initiative in Odisha and very little financing is being 
done by the commercial banks. The State Government has been providing 
huge amount of subsidy and tubewells are being established through the state 
Page 16 of 18 
 agencies. In some of the schemes the subsidy is as high as 80 per cent. 
Hence, banks may find it profitable to enhance investment credit by financing 
such irrigation projects. There is also a need to look beyond the tubewells. 
Drip and Sprinkler systems is one such alternate which has tremendous 
potential. 
 
Storage & marketing 
43. Shortage of storage space often leads to substantial post-harvest losses yet 
there are a very few initiatives for setting up large storage structures. Terminal 
markets are almost non-existent and organized mandis/APMCs are also not 
very active despite amendments in APMC Act. Cold Chain arrangements for 
vegetables and fruits remain non-existent in the State. Therefore, it is 
important that the participation of private sector is encouraged in large 
proportion. 
 
G. Concluding Thoughts 
 
44. In the last 50 years, Odisha has lost nearly a decade by way of natural 
calamities. This has severely affected the development of the State and 
particularly the agriculture sector. Many studies have empirically proved that 
agricultural growth is more poverty reducing than growth in non-agricultural 
sectors implying that rural poverty reduction has been associated with growth 
in agriculture and productivity. A study by Ligon et al (2007) concluded that 
GDP growth originating in agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing 
poverty as GDP growth originating in other sectors of economy. Given the 
incidence of poverty in Odisha which stood at 46.4 per cent as against the all-
India level of 27.5 per cent, the importance of agriculture growth in the State 
cannot be understated. Here it will be important to stress the proactive role 
that can be played by existing institutional arrangements like SLBC for 
continuous evaluation and monitoring of the developments in the sector in a 
holistic manner. 
 
45. I feel extremely happy to be here to share my thoughts on the issues and 
challenges for the sector in the state with such a learned and knowledgeable 
audience. It is fair to set high expectations from such a conclave for setting an 
exacting yet achievable agenda with concrete action plans which will lead to 
significant and rapid transformation of the sector in the state in the next few 
years. I am sure this conclave will provide a stimulating platform for all the 
stakeholders interested in the development of the agriculture of the State to 
interact and enable convergence of views. This conclave should pave way for 
the development of the agriculture sector in Odisha towards greater 
production and productivity, higher income levels for the farmer and profitable 
business opportunities for the financing institutions. The consequent rapid 
transformation of the agricultural sector should enable all the stakeholders to 
reap the benefits on a sustainable basis in Odisha which has to play a key 
role in the scheme of Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India. 
 
46. I will like to end, rather start, with great expectations about the outcome of the 
conclave.  
 
47. Thank you all.
