1Central Bank Communications : Some Random ThoughtsMs. Wanda Tseng, Mr. Ariyoshi, distinguished fellow central bankers and friends,At the outset, I would like to extend a hearty welcome to all our guests toIndia. I hope you will find the weather outside as well as the intellectualstimulation in the seminar pleasant and productive. I am thankful to theorganisers for inviting me to participate in the seminar. The subject is close to ourhead and heart and we, in the RBI, had organized a SAARCFIN sponsoredseminar last year on this subject, and we learnt a lot from each others’experience in South Asia. Today’s seminar is different, and may perhaps prove tobe specially rewarding for several reasons: it covers a wider range of centralbanks, and has the benefit of participation by multi-lateral institution as well asthe media representation, in addition to a private sector bank.  The organisersneed to be complimented on an excellent structuring of the seminar in terms ofissues, classification and participation. I find the key questions for considerationlisted in the programme very pertinent , and so, perhaps it is ideal for the keynoteaddress to outline some random thoughts on the questions, based on ourexperience in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).In the past, central banking was shrouded in secrecy with some ‘mystique’surrounding it. In the recent years, however, there has been greater visibility,transparency and communication. What are the reasons? First, increasedindependence of central banks warranting publicly accountable conduct; second,adoption of inflation-targeting – whether through a legal sanction or otherwise;third, a mandate to the central banks, either explicit or implicit, for maintainingfinancial stability in a world where the financial markets and their expectationmatter. It is interesting to note that even in the UK, where there is a FinancialServices Authority, it is the Bank of England which publishes the FinancialStability Report, periodically.What are the theoretical perspectives in this regard? The academic andpolicy literature recognises the role of communication for the effectiveness of                                                1 Keynote address delivered by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Regional Seminaron Central Bank Communications sponsored by the International Monetary Fund, held at Hotel Taj LandEnd, Mumbai on January 23, 20062monetary policy, and has broadly focused on four aspects of policy, namely,efficiency, time-consistency, optimality of communications, and institutional-cum-decision making processes. Efficiency issues centre around quality, elements ofnoise, formation of expectations, and implementation lags. The time-consistencyissues relate to the conditions for substitutability between communications andpolicy actions, and choices between effectiveness of unanticipated policiesrelative to elimination of uncertainty in private decision making. The optimalityissues address the aspects of dangers of disseminating information which couldresult in crowding out of the formulation of independent beliefs by the privatesector – which is critical to well-functioning markets. The institutional anddecision-making processes of monetary policy refer to the recent trends towardsautonomous group-decision making, like the Monetary Policy Committee of theUK; the composition of the groups, the periodicity of their meetings, theattributability of opinions, the transparency, etc. It should, therefore, be clear thateven on the limited issue of communication policy in regard to monetary policy,the literature provides a framework but the practices tend to be diverse amongstcountries. There is no universally valid international benchmark on the subject butthe framework, which is still evolving, is useful as a reference point for exchangeof information amongst different countries that this Regional Seminar seeks topromote. While the framework for a country is useful, it is the judgment within theframework that really matters. In India, we are proceeding gradually to a moreopen and participative process monetary policy formulation, which will be coveredby my colleagues later in the seminar.The growing importance of communications by central banks is on accountof their responsibility for maintaining financial stability – which includes but goesbeyond the conduct of monetary policy. There is an assumption that well-informed market participants would enable, if not assure, an improved functioningof the markets, and a central bank is in the best position to provide such usefulinformation. However, whether providing information would result in shaping andmanaging expectations, and if so, whether it is desirable, are difficult issues. Forexample, The US Federal Reserve, since 1994, appears to have been providingforward guidance, while the European Central Bank appears to be in the mould ofkeeping the markets informed rather than guiding it. We, in India, have taken amiddle path of sharing our analysis in addition to information, but in no way3guiding the market participants. However, in doing so, we have the benefit of theprocess of two-way communication, of information as well as perceptions,between the market participants and the RBI. The two-way process is enabled byformal structured meetings with industry associations, through standing advisorycommittees, and informal / ad hoc committees, technical reports, working groups,etc.At this stage, I must share with you one concern about the credibilitybonus earned by the effective communications policy. Is it possible that such“hands on” and “very successful” communications by the central banks in theworld to maintain financial stability have resulted in under-pricing of risks by theprivate sector, or in distinct lowering of aversion to financial risks? Is it possiblethat this credibility bonus is partly responsible for the upward movement of thehousing and equity prices becoming a global phenomenon?The issue of financial stability is of great significance and enormouscomplexity for central bankers in the Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). TheEMEs vary considerably in their fiscal, current account, openness to externalsector, and dependence on oil-earnings or oil-imports. Yet, the analysts in thefinancial markets often treat them as a group, presumably because the EMEs areperceived to be to be high-risk and high-reward destination for financial capital.That characteristic lends them to vulnerability in capital flows, sometimes forreasons other than economic fundamentals in the country concerned. As the titleimplies, the EMEs are emerging from one state to another, namely, from lessmarket orientation to greater market orientation, and are thus, in a state oftransition. The central banks in the EMEs, in their pursuit of financial stability,have two additional challenges. First, to mange the transition in their owneconomies, which has socio-economic as well as political dimensions; second, tokeep a watch on the sentiment of foreign capital flows – which could change forreasons other than domestic. While for a particular foreign investor it may be asmall portfolio shift from an EME to an industrialised country, it may be one oflarge magnitude for the EME concerned. The challenges for communicationpolicy are considerably more complex for the central banks in the EMEs foranother reason, namely, the asymmetrical response of the financial markets tothe developments in the EMEs. For instance, the market reaction to an increase4of, say, US dollar five billion in the forex reserves of an EME would becomparatively subdued vis-à-vis the response to a decline in reserves by a likeamount.In India, several measures, monetary as well as administrative, wereundertaken to meet the threats to financial stability while complementary orparallel recourse was taken to communications. Some illustrations are: a speechin Goa in August 1997 to “talk down the rupee”; reassuring statements on marketdevelopments in the context of Asian crisis combined with a package ofmeasures, in tranches in 1997 and 1998; pre-emptive measures in mid-1998 inthe context of crisis in Russia; reassuring statements issued in the context ofKargil war in 1999; a combination of liquidity injection, reassuring statementsalong with measures in the context of the 9/11; a combination of actions andmeasures at the time of sharp downward movement of Indian stock markets onMay 17, 2004 coinciding with the political transition at the national level; andmore recently, to explain the impact of redemption of the India MillenniumDeposits to the extent of US dollar seven billion. There are several otherinstances when there were thoughtful inactions. For instance, RBI decided not totake any measure or issue a statement when US imposed sanctions on India. Inbrief, we have open market operations, open mouth operations, and open onlyeyes and ears operations in regard to threats to financial stability.Many central banks perform a multitude of functions and theirresponsibilities are seldom restricted to monetary policy and financial stability.Hence, communication policies and strategies have to be tailored to meet theneeds of specific function to be performed on the one hand, and on the other,having an overall consistent or common policy framework within which the centralbank functions. For instance, the RBI has the responsibility to develop andregulate money, forex and government securities markets, with some dilemmasto be resolved when RBI is both a developer and a regulator. It is also a debtmanger to the Central and the State governments. Thus, the communicationpolicies, strategies and contents while dealing with the market intermediaries aredifferent from those adopted, in dealing with, say, State governments, for whomRBI is also a banker and a debt manager. The RBI is also a regulator, specially ofbanks, with distinct interests being served, namely, depositors, consumers ingeneral, systemic efficiency as well as stability, and the banks themselves whose5health is critical to the financial sector. Communication policies are, therefore,tailored separately for each category of stakeholders. Finally, several servicesare rendered by a central bank, specially in matters relating to currency andcoins, payments system, credit information, and overall, grievance redressals.Communication, indeed, is not neutral to the target audience. For a centralbank’s communication, it is varied and includes general public, financial marketparticipants, media persons, entities regulated by the central bank, academics,financial markets analysts, rating agencies, international or multi-lateral bodies,etc. Let me illustrate with a communication initiative that RBI took recently. TheOmbudsman Scheme for banks was revised recently and hence, the objectivewas to inform the widest section of our population. A Press Release might nothave fully served the purpose. So, a decision was taken to issue anadvertisement – for which the content was indeed common but the languagesdiffered. It was interesting to notice that while 17 leading English newspapershave a combined circulation of 6.3 million and readership of 17.9 million, the 15leading Hindi newspapers have a larger circulation at 8.1 million and a far largerreadership at 87.0 million – that is, almost five times larger. In fact, 54 leadingnon-English newspapers in India have a circulation of 21.4 million and areadership of 197.2 million. This has been our target coverage for the latest effortin communication, recognizing that most of the targeted 200 million middle-classin India reads vernacular newspapers.There are several dilemmas faced by central banks while designing anappropriate communications policy.  What should be communicated and to whatdegree of disaggregation, are one set of issues.  The second set relates to: atwhat stage of evolution of internal thinking and debate should there bedissemination. The third set relates to the timing of communication with referenceto its market impact. The fourth relates to the quality of information and thepossible ways in which it could be perceived.  Thus, alleged incoherence or anelement of ambiguity at times on the part of central bankers in explaining policiesis as much a reflection of the complexity of the issues as it is of the differingperceptions of a variety of audiences to which the communication  is addressed.In assessing the contribution of the media to the financial sector as a6public good, I would distinguish among at least four types of effects. The first typemay be characterised as the ‘news effect’, which would normally reflect factual orformal positions or events. In a sense, the media’s reporting would be faithful andnon-controversial. A second type can be identified as ‘rumour effect’, and oftenrumours have a destabilising effect and in some cases have the potential todegenerate into self-perpetuating or self-fulfilling events. The rumour effect oftenresults in unintended losses or gains and people may suspect that there is somevested interest behind such rumours. Needless to say, the media’s role will, onthe whole, tend to be negative in this channel. The third type is marked by the‘survey effect’. It is not uncommon for the media to undertake opinion polls orsurveys and these could have methodological and other problems in terms ofreflecting the true picture. These surveys have a tendency to influence theperception of markets and sometimes the general public. In such a case, thecontribution of the media would depend on scientific methodology adopted,transparency of assumptions, and objectivity in presentation of the results.Adequate care is a pre-condition to ensure a positive effect through this channel.The fourth is the ‘interpretation effect’, where media tries to interpret the standtaken by policy makers or markets or corporates. The interpretation effect may bepositive or negative depending on professional skills as well as commitment toobjectives. Responsibility and accountability would be key to ensure positiveeffect through this channel. In brief, it is my submission that the media’sresponsibilities are not confined to its shareholders or to its subscribers, butextend to the larger segment of the public. In this sense, the challenges anddilemmas before the media are perhaps no less than those before the centralbanks.It is also fair and appropriate to recognize that media itself faces severaldilemmas. For example, there are pressures to be the first to report – a race to bethe number one. There are incentives to be distinctive. They have severalstakeholders to cater to. They may or may not have ideological predilections. Butas far as the RBI is concerned, the media has been very fair and I find it apleasure, inspiration and education to interact with the media.  It is great fun toshare my confusions and dilemmas with all types of media – which are amongstthe best and the brightest in India.7Before concluding, it is essential to appreciate that communication policyis not merely about explaining or getting a feedback on policy, but may includeelements of influencing the policy direction itself. A central bank does this throughseveral channels, including research publications and speeches. As Dr. I. G.Patel, an eminent statesman-scholar and one of my distinguished predecessorssaid in 2004:“Communication is not just about transparency. It is also about education,guidance and steering things in the right direction. In this, the central bankcan be an honest broker between the government and the public and eventhe parliament.”Perhaps, it is possible to illustrate, with a bit of lack of modesty, how this has2been done, with a quote from Mr. S. S. Tarapore , my predecessor as DeputyGovernor:“While I have been assigned the task of talking about gold and capitalaccount convertibility, before doing so I would, for a moment, like to referto some developments prior to the setting up of the committee on CapitalAccount Convertibility (CAC). When the definitive history of India’s policyon gold is written up, the speech by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Deputy Governor,Reserve bank of India, at the World Gold Council Conference on 28November 1996 will stand out as a watershed as it is perhaps the onlyspeech by a senior Indian official which squarely takes on issues on goldpolicy and it will be appropriately recorded as a forerunner of major policychange. It is by raising pertinent issues that Dr. Reddy has paved the wayfor the committee to come up with specific recommendations on India’spolicy on gold.”An interesting question that arises is about the role of the Governor of a centralbank when important policy issues impinging on central banking are involved. Aquote from late Dr. I. G. Patel would perhaps be the best guide:“But the point is, when such vital questions arise, the Governor can not                                                2  His address at Gold banking Seminar of World Gold Council, New Delhi, 2 August, 1997.8just be inactive. He is a public servant with loyalty to the country and theconstitution – not just to a government in transit. And yet, he can notbehave as if every issue is of great import. He has to choose his groundand be discreet above all. Without offending the Government, he can starta debate and steer the argument in a certain direction. His ultimatedefence is democracy and the tradition of free debate.”  Let me again thank you all for provoking me think about the subject.I wish the seminar all success and we, in the RBI, look forward to benefiting fromthe deliberations.
