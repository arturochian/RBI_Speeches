Addressing the Regulatory Perimeter Issues – Indian Experience 
Shyamala Gopinath 
 
1. The regulatory perimeter or boundary issue has been engaging the attention of policy makers 
internationally for quite some time but it was not a central issue associated with the current 
crisis.  Paradoxically the origins as well the severity of impact of the crisis were concentrated in 
the most heavily regulated institutions. However, in my view, the real issue lay in not 
recognizing and addressing the dynamic inter-connectedness between entities across regulated, 
unregulated and lightly regulated domains perpetuated through high leverage. It was a systemic 
crisis and attributing it to any single component of the system would only be an incomplete 
assessment.  
 
2. Borrowing from the field of natural ecosystems, sustainability of a complex flow system 
depends on the optimal balance between efficiency and resilience of its network. While the 
financial system was considered to be very efficient, the inherent elements for ensuring resilience 
were obviously inadequate. At the heart of this self-feeding financial ecosystem were entities 
which had access to liquidity, the banks, which acted as the fulcrum around which the system 
moved. It is therefore not surprising that the system collapsed once this fulcrum became 
vulnerable. The peripheral entities, though, were as much an integral part of the system and need 
to be recognized as such.  
 
3. The basic premise that I will be elaborating upon in my remarks today is that as far as 
systemic stability is concerned, it is more important to focus on the interconnected linkages 
amongst all major entities within the system, whether regulated or unregulated. Extending 
regulatory boundary is a very valid issue to be examined for its own sake, to address the specific 
contextual concerns. But once having decided the perimeter, it is extremely important to have a 
framework for hardwiring the perimeter. This is important as regulation creates incentives for 
certain activities to move beyond the boundary.   
 
4. One of the issues with just focusing on extending the perimeter, apart from issues clearly 
enunciated in the literature, relates to heterogeneity of regulatory foci across various segments. 
The boundary itself varies for different regulatory clusters - the focus of a banking regulator 
would be entirely different from that of a securities regulator, from that of an insurance regulator 
etc. and all of which may be different from the focus required for regulation of markets. If the 
entire financial system is looked as a single ecosystem, then inspite of the inherent differences 
between the various market players, it should be possible to identify the macro drivers of the 
whole system, the network flows. Using this perspective, it becomes evident that just focusing 
only on the perimeter would be missing an integral component that may need regulatory 
attention.

Current crisis – Perimeter Issues 
 
5. As mentioned earlier, the origins of the current crisis lay within the heavily regulated 
institutions. The impact of the crisis, however, was exacerbated by dynamic interconnectedness 
between entities across regulated, unregulated and lightly regulated sectors. As some of the 
recent reports have pointed out, the two concerns relating to ‘outside perimeter’ entities that 
contributed to the current crisis were: (i) maturity transformation being undertaken by these 
entities, which traditionally used to be a function of banks; and (ii) the systemic leverage 
resulting out of the hugely leveraged positions of these entities, either through direct borrowing 
from banks or through the funding markets.  
 
6. The central issue in both the above is the interaction between the unregulated entities and the 
formal regulated funding channels, essentially banks and money markets. The maturity 
transformation primarily entailed heavy reliance by these entities on short term funds for funding 
long term assets.  The prudential framework for banks placed a significant reliance on 
management of these ALM mismatches but the unregulated entities, such as SIVs didn’t have 
any oversight and as a business model, ran huge ALM mismatches. The model just broke down 
when the funding markets started seizing.  
 
7. Many of the entities, like hedge funds, were consciously left unregulated because of the fact 
that they managed only private capital pools where the issue of investor protection was not 
relevant. However, what was not appreciated was the systemic risks these entities were posing on 
account of the huge leverage positions these were carrying through either the formal banking 
channel or the funding markets, particularly repo markets. The seamless efficiency thought to be 
provided by close integration of the underlying asset markets and repo markets proved to be just 
a chimera. The disaggregated exposures of the regulated clusters at any point of time to the 
unregulated entities were not available and as the markets collapsed, such exposures became 
evident.  
 
8. Another critical aspect which was again brought forth during this crisis was the market 
behaviour and impact of entities, some of them unregulated, having huge trading books and 
dynamically hedging their huge portfolios. The market makers in the derivative and structured 
product markets need to normally hedge their portfolio risks, which has a direct impact on the 
underlying markets. In normal times, such individual action does not have a systemic impact. 
However, in times of crisis when the views become absolutely uni-dimensional, a large number 
of such big players tend to hit the market on the same side and the resultant impact on the 
underlying market is huge. It could, thus, be argued that the efficient markets enabled the 
unregulated cluster to acquire systemic proportions and reinforced its connectedness with the 
regulated cluster.  
 
The Indian experience 
9. India is unique in this regard as it has a formalized structure for generic non bank finance 
sector with heterogeneous sub-segments. There some 13000 non banking finance companies 
(NBFCs) whose assets comprise around one-tenth of the banking sector. The NBFCs in India 3 
 
comprises heterogenous types of financial institutions including All-India financial institutions, 
development finance institutions, non banking finance companies, etc, with each one of them 
having its roots at a particular stage of development of the financial sector. All-India financial 
institutions (AIFIs), and development finance institutions (DFIs), which were largely an offshoot 
of development planning in India, were created for long-term financing with some of them 
having sectoral/regional focus. Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), on the other hand, 
are mostly private sector institutions, which have carved their niche in the Indian financial 
system.   
The Basic Regulatory Framework 
10. The Indian financial system is a predominantly bank intermediated system and accordingly 
regulation over banks has worked as the basic systemic lever. The non-banking space comprises 
of heterogeneous entities but not all are regulated by the RBI. Broadly speaking, the RBI 
regulates all such companies taking public deposits and those non-deposit taking entities 
involved in asset financing, providing loans and investments. Other non-banking entities such as 
housing finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, stock broking companies, 
merchant banking companies, venture capital funds etc. are regulated by the respective sectoral 
regulator and are exempted from the NBFC regulations. 
11. Regulation of Non-Banking Finance Companies in India was considered necessary as far 
back as the sixties as an adjunct to the monetary and credit policy of the country and protection 
of depositors' interest. The emphasis of regulation was on protection of the interest of depositors 
and as such directions issued by RBI dealt with acceptance of deposits and matters relating 
thereto. The unfettered growth of deposits and institutions accepting them outside banking 
system in the nineties was   a matter of concern. Further in the absence of any prudential norms 
or ceilings, several non-bank finance companies made poor investment choices, leading to high 
level of NPAs, liquidity crunch and consequent significant default in repayment of deposits.  
Therefore, some further regulatory action was taken including registration of these companies, 
for which the statutory powers were given to the RBI through the  RBI (Amendment) Act in 
January 1997. The Act provided for registration of all NBFCs; nevertheless the RBI focused 
mainly on depositor protection and put in place stringent regulatory requirements for these 
entities.  
12. With the growth of the financial system, it gradually came to be realized that even non-
deposit taking entities, which were mostly in asset financing and loan business, could pose 
systemic risks on account of their interactions with the formal banking system and market based 
financing. Moreover, many such entities in this lightly regulated segment were essentially 
indulging in regulatory arbitrage – what was not permitted for banks was happening through this 
channel. It was therefore decided in 2006 to put in place an elaborate prudential framework for 
such identified entities having systemic implications.  
13. A gradually calibrated regulatory framework was created to address the issue of systemic 
risk, which included prudential capital requirements, exposure norms, liquidity management, 
asset liability management, creation of entity profile and reporting requirements, corporate 
governance and disclosure norms for non banking finance companies defined as systemically 
important.  4 
 
14. It was recognized early on that mere acceptance of public deposits would not capture the 
systemic importance of the entities and hence the focus was shifted to acceptance of public funds 
in any form. So, any entity that is accessing public funds, whether through deposits, inter 
corporate deposits, debt instruments such as NCDs or CPs, or bank loans, was considered 
interconnected entity and hence treated as a source of potential risk. The ultimate objective was 
that such interconnectedness should not result in transmission of risk to banks or the payment 
and settlement system.   
15. In the Indian context, what has provided a huge systemic advantage is the fact that the 
regulation of key financial markets – money market, Government securities market, forex market 
and credit market – vests with the banking regulator i.e. the RBI. Thus the channels of 
interconnectedness between banks and other financial sector entities are not beyond the 
regulatory purview. From a financial stability perspective, the above framework has proved to be 
a sound model.   
16. Some of the specific provisions which illustrate the effectiveness of the above framework in 
addressing the inter-connected linkages are briefly mentioned below: 
• Prudential limits on bank exposures (funded and non-funded) to non-bank finance 
companies - individual as well as aggregate;  
• Restrictions on bank financing to non-bank finance companies against collateral of shares 
or for on-lending to capital market intermediaries; 
• Prudential limits on bank exposures to equity markets includes exposure to capital market 
intermediaries such as brokers; 
• Prudential regulations on inter-bank exposures of banks  to reduce systemic risk;  
• Participation in the overnight unsecured money market limited to banks and primary 
dealers; 
• Lending/borrowing by non-banks in the overnight market  allowed only through repos or 
against collateral of government bonds;    
• Securitisation guidelines issued to banks in 2006 which provided for, inter alia, credit 
enhancements to be deducted from capital, profit/premium from sale to be amortised over 
the life of the securities issued, liquidity support to attract 100 per cent risk weight.   
Addressing the inter-connectedness – few pipeline issues 
17. The securities firms/investment banks are regulated by the securities regulator, the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) but such regulation primarily focuses on transparency and 
discipline in market practices. As these entities are normally not doing fund based business 
which would require prudential regulation, a decision had been taken that entities registered with 
SEBI need not normally be registered with RBI. While these entities form part of a separate 
regulatory cluster, their inter-linkages with the other regulated clusters or other unregulated 
entities may need to be examined particularly if such entities also undertake fund based business. 
Therefore a constant evaluation is required of the functioning of institutions under different 
regulators to address regulatory gaps.   5 
 
18. While mutual funds are regulated from investor protection angle by the securities regulator, 
the systemic implications of the inert-linkages became apparent in the post-Lehman scenario of 
severe risk aversion and liquidity crunch. RBI had to announce a special 14 day repo at for a 
notified amount of Rs.20,000 crore to enable banks to meet the liquidity  requirements of Mutual 
Funds. The real issue was the over reliance of the money market mutual funds on short term 
funds placed by the large corporates and banks with redemption facilities on par with current 
accounts of banks. It has now been decided to jointly work with the securities regulator to 
identify and address the macro-prudential concerns arising from the current framework. 
19. Private Equity/venture capital activity is not a regulated activity per se. However, the issue of 
bank involvement with such funds has come into focus recently in India. The G30 recommends 
the large systemically important banking institutions should be restricted in undertaking 
proprietary activities that present high risks and serious conflicts of interest. Sponsorship and 
management of co-mingled private pools of capital should ordinarily be prohibited and large 
proprietary trading should be limited by strict capital and liquidity requirements. Keeping in 
view the reputational risk involved in such activities, the Reserve Bank had mandated 
maintenance of certain level of economic capital in some of the cases approved in the recent 
past.  Importantly, all exposures of a bank to a venture capital fund are treated as capital market 
exposure and counted for the regulatory limit.  
 
A revised regulatory framework – key considerations 
20. The broad features of a possible framework to capture the above inter-linkages are outlined 
below.  
 
(i) Specification of the nature of connectedness between entities that may be considered 
inducing vulnerabilities in the system; 
(ii) Identification, from the haze of the unregulated cluster, the class of entities 
considered to be either having significant direct connectedness with the regulated 
clusters or having a significant presence in any market segment where regulated 
entities are also present; 
(iii)Putting in place a reporting system to capture the interconnected flows within the 
identified sub-system – the regulated clusters and the unregulated entities on a regular 
basis; 
(iv) Prescription of a prudential framework - and this is the key - for the regulated clusters 
to contain the risks arising from this connectedness.  
(v) For the unregulated entities, the most significant aspect would be to contain their 
leveraging capability in general across major market segments, particularly the 
funding markets. A simple quantitative limit would be the best suited.  
(vi) Some systemically significant entities, though, may still need a formal prudential 
regulatory structure, including capital adequacy requirement. 
 
21. From a policy perspective, the critical points would be the last two – having effective 
regulation over the regulated entities, while restraining leverage capabilities of the 
unregulated/lightly regulated entities. In our case, it proved to be an effective combination since 
banks’ exposure to such entities could be regulated through absolute exposure norms or even 
tweaking the risk weights applicable to such exposures.  6 
 
22. I realize the problem would be much more involved in predominantly market based financial 
systems where direct bank linkages are not very obvious. But even in such regimes, as has been 
clearly demonstrated, the indirect linkages of banks were enmeshed in the maze. That is why it 
would be important to ensure that the markets too should not provide leverage capabilities to 
such entities beyond a limit.  
Contingency liquidity provision 
23. The recent crisis has again brought to the fore the role of a lender of last resort (LOLR), the 
extent of central bank intervention and the entities to which such intervention can be extended. 
The question as to under what circumstances and to what extent should safety nets be extended 
to non-deposit taking institutions has been widely debated.  
24. The basic underpinning of the LOLR philosophy internationally has been that any institution 
whose failure is conclusively decided to cause broader systemic instability needs to be supported 
in the interregnum. As long as banks were the only institutions fulfilling this criterion, the case 
was straightforward. However, with the development of global financial markets and growth on 
non-banks as alternate media of financial intermediation, the decisions were not so simple as the 
recent experience has clearly shown.  
25. In India, while there is no provision for the Reserve Bank of India to lend directly to any 
non-bank entities, except a few specified ones, there have been specific instances of workable 
arrangements being devised in the interest of broader stability to provide liquidity support to 
some institutions/sectors indirectly. In respect of non-banking finance companies, in the post-
Lehman fallout there was severe systemic liquidity crunch and even the non-banking finance 
sector were stressed. It was apprehended that in a scenario of asymmetrical information and 
general risk aversion of banks, the strains in non-banking finance sector  could eventually pose a 
systemic risk.  It was then decided to provide liquidity to those systemically important NBFCs 
facing temporary liquidity mismatches through an SPV. The key part was that the liquidity was 
provided to the SPV by the RBI through purchase of fully government guaranteed bonds. 
Further, this facility was only meant to tide over temporary liquidity mismatches and not for 
balance sheet expansion. The aggregate quantum for the facility was around Rs. 200 billion 
(USD 4 billion) and the interest rate was the LOLR rate for banks. 
26. Similarly in case of mutual funds, who were faced with severe redemption pressures, it was 
decided to have a facility for lending to banks through a 14-day repo to enable the banks to meet 
the temporary liquidity needs of mutual funds.  
27. As regards protection of depositor interests, a comprehensive prudential framework is 
already in place for all deposit taking companies. Stringent capital adequacy and leverage 
requirements, exposure norms, and disclosure have been prescribed as part of a structured 
regulatory framework. Statutorily, such companies are required to invest at least 10 per cent of 
their outstanding deposits in unencumbered Government bonds. Further, NBFCs have to ensure 
that at all times there is full cover for public deposits maintained by them. All such companies 
accepting/ holding public deposits are required to create a floating charge on their statutory 
liquid assets in favour of their depositors through the mechanism of ‘Trust Deed’. 7 
 
Conclusion 
28. The issue of extending the regulatory perimeter has to be a balancing act and it needs to be 
carefully nuanced in terms of intended objectives. The thrust of regulation may need to be borne 
by the regulated clusters – particularly deposit taking institutions. However, for the unregulated 
cluster, the key issues would be to contain their ability for systemic leverage – both directly 
through banks or indirectly through funding markets and to subject them to an effective reporting 
arrangement for their inter-linkages with the regulated clusters. From a systemic stability 
perspective, it would be equally, if not more, important to focus on the interconnectedness of the 
regulated and unregulated/lightly regulated entities.
