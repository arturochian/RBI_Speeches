Productivity Trends in Indian Banking in the Post Reform Period  Experience,  1 Issues and Future Challenges  Shri K.R. Kamath, Chairman, IBA and CMD, Punjab National Bank; Shri H.S.U.  Kamath, CMD, Vijaya Bank; Smt. V.R. Iyer, CMD, Bank of India; Shri R.K. Dubey, CMD,  Canara Bank; Shri M. Narendra, CMD, Indian Overseas Bank; Shri D. Sarkar, CMD  Union Bank of India; other senior colleagues from the banking industry; delegates to the  conference; members of the print and electronic media; ladies and gentlemen. It is,  indeed, a great pleasure and privilege for me to address this august gathering today  and I thank FICCI and the IBA for this opportunity. The conference, which is in its twelfth  edition, has succeeded in bringing together the best minds in the banking industry and  has grown into a platform which deliberates contemporary issues facing Indian banking.  I am very glad to note the theme chosen for this years event, Consistency, Quality and  Resilience: The Next Frontier for Productivity and Excellence. I strongly believe that  productivity and efficiency in banking services would be the bulwark for all round  economic development in India. Considering the challenges currently confronting the  economy, there is little doubt that the time for the next big productivity push in Indian  banking is now. I therefore, congratulate FICCI and IBA for their choice of theme for the  conference and do hope that ideas emanating from the conference deliberations bear  fruition in the coming days.  2. I am happy to note that BCG has brought out a study report on the theme of the  conference, which, based on extensive field survey, has recommended several  measures for attaining productivity excellence in Indian banking. I congratulate BCG for  their effort and do hope that the banking industry gives serious thought to the study  recommendations and takes them forward in right earnest.  3. During my address today, I would be highlighting the trends in productivity in  Indian banking over the last two decades, including trends across bank groups.  However, the thrust of my address would be on the fact that improvements in   1 SpecialaddressbyDr.K.C.Chakrabarty,DeputyGovernor,ReserveBankofIndiaatFIBAC2013,organizedby FICCIandIBAatMumbaionAugust13,2013. 1 productivity and efficiency of banks has not had the desired beneficial impact on all  segments of our economy and hence, there is a need for the entire paradigm of banking  productivity and efficiency to be reoriented to be in alignment with our national priorities.  Productivity and Efficiency  4. Investopedia defines productivity as an economic measure of output per unit of  input. The concept of productivity is more easily applied to industrial settings while it is  more difficult to define and measure in the context of services sector, including the  banking industry. We often have to rely upon proxies to gauge productivity of banks and  there is no single measure that has been universally accepted as representing banking  productivity.   5. It is common to see the terms productivity and efficiency being used  interchangeably in literature. However, productivity is more a measure of performance  of labour, which is one of the factors of production.  Efficiency, on the other hand, is a  much broader term which represents the performance of all factors of production. In  case of banks, while productivity measures the performance of their staff, efficiency  represents the combined performance of staff, capital and management. However, let  me add that there are strong inter-linkages between the performance of the three  factors of production: high productivity of staff will result in efficient utilization of capital,  while an efficient management function would result in superior performance by labour  and capital. It would, therefore, be safe to conclude that when all the key inputs are  optimally deployed, the outcome will be an efficient bank. Having said that, let me state  upfront that I would also be using the terms productivity and efficiency concurrently in  my address today.  Productivity and Efficiency of Banks  6. Banks form the core of a nations financial system, performing the vital function of  financial intermediation through liquidity, maturity and risk transformation. Finance is the  lifeline of any commercial activity and banks act as a link between the savers and the  borrowers. The productivity and efficiency of banks, thus, critically impacts the  productivity and efficiency of all economic activity and is a matter of concern for policy  2 makers and economy watchers. There are two aspects to banking efficiency which I  would like to highlight:  (i) Allocational Efficiency: Allocational efficiency focuses on ensuring that the precious  financial resources are allotted to the most productive activities as per development  needs of society. It seeks to ensure that the broad national priorities are furthered  through the process of resource allocation and that the interests of the most vulnerable  sections are protected.   (ii) Operational Efficiency: Operational Efficiency means banks seek to provide  financial services in a safe, secure, speedy and cost effective manner. The goal should  be to ensure that the transformation function generates least friction in terms of time  and cost overlays.   7. The concepts of allocational and operational efficiencies have considerable inter- linkages and the challenge for banks is to ensure optimal performance on both fronts.  However, as I would argue later in my address, the Indian banking system has not  succeeded in balancing these two parameters, with the result that progress on one has  been at the cost of the other.  8. Those who would recollect my address at FIBAC 2012 may remember that I had  sought to deliberate on the concept of allocational efficiency through the Revised  Priority Sector Guidelines, which had been issued a few months earlier. The theme for  this years event permits me to take my thoughts forward by focusing on the other  element, viz. operational efficiency and on the interplay between the two.   Importance of Productivity in Banking  9. As I mentioned earlier, banks perform the important function of financial  intermediation and the efficiency of their operations has an important bearing on overall  economic health of the country. Greater efficiency in banking operations ensures that  the cost of financial intermediation is minimized. At a time when the global and Indian  economy are facing challenges on multiple fronts, efficient financial intermediation  3 would provide impetus to the process of economic recovery by channelizing funds to the  most productive sectors at the lowest cost.  10. Improvement in productivity and efficiency, and the resultant decline in cost of  providing financial services will help in furthering financial inclusion (FI). More  importantly, it will help in converting the improved access to financial services into  improved usage. This improved usage will make the FI activities commercially viable  both for the banks and for the BCs and encourage them to scale up their FI initiatives,  thereby helping in quickly bringing the remaining unbanked villages into the fold of the  formal financial system. Hence, banking productivity and efficiency has a direct impact  on improving financial access and financial usage.  11. The recent decline in economic growth has presented significant challenges to  banks through rising impairment of assets, pressure on margins and volatility in non- interest income. In this demanding business environment, improved operational  efficiency will help banks in standing up to the challenges and enable them to maintain  their health and profitability. I strongly believe that every time the financial system has  been faced with a crisis, a resolute push towards improved productivity and efficiency  has invariably aided it in seeing through the troubled times.  12. As banks form the core of the countrys financial system, the health and  profitability of banks will help in ensuring stability and resilience of the entire financial  system. Thus, from a systemic stability perspective also, improved productivity and  efficiency of the banking system is a definite positive.  Productivity Trends in Indian Banking  13. The Indian banking industry has, over the years, taken significant strides in its  quest for greater productivity. Analysis of data (based on various parameters) indicates  that Indian banks, particularly the public sector banks, have shown significant progress  on the productivity and efficiency front. The efficiency of banks has been analyzed  based on cost based parameters and profitability linked parameters.    4 Cost based Parameters  Table 1                                    Operating Expenses Ratios    (figures in %)  All Banks 1992 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013  Operating Exp to Avg. Assets 2.60 2.82 3.00 3.01 2.88 2.84 2.35 2.32 2.12 1.87 1.86 1.75  Operating Exp to Avg. Business 2.09 2.27 2.51 2.51 2.39 2.34 1.93 1.85 1.59 1.39 1.36 1.26  Cost Income Ratio 55.58 72.46 63.41 61.00 64.30 63.38 48.36 49.56 50.13 44.68 45.23 45.02  14. As can be seen from the table above, all three ratios have seen a significant  improvement during this period, indicating improved efficiency of the banking system.  For instance, the Ratio of Operating Expenses to Average Assets has seen a decline  from 2.60% to 1.75% during 1992-2013. A bank-group wise analysis indicates that  Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have seen much greater progress as compared to new  private banks and foreign banks (Tables in Annex). The Cost Income ratio across bank  groups also indicates similar pattern, with the ratio seeing a significant decline over the  period 1995-2013. The main drivers of this decline were the PSBs, which saw a  perceptible decline in this ratio while new private banks and foreign banks, in fact, saw a  rise in this ratio over the period under review.   15. An analysis of the CAGR of various expense parameters indicates that operating  expenses grew at a CAGR of 14.65% between 1992 and 2013, whereas staff expenses  grew at a CAGR of 13.63% during this period. PSBs had the lowest CAGR for operating  expenses, staff expenses and other operating expenses (Table in Annex)  Table 2:                Staff Expenses and Other Operating Expenses Ratios   (figures in %)  All Banks 1992 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013  Staff Exp to Average Assets 1.75 1.88 1.98 2.04 1.91 1.93 1.46 1.36 1.16 1.00 1.10 0.98  Staff Exp to Average Business 1.40 1.52 1.66 1.70 1.58 1.59 1.20 1.09 0.86 0.75 0.80 0.70  Staff Expenses per employee  (in ` 000s) 65 74 98 134 173 268 280 342 408 511 727 799  Other Operating Exp to  Average Assets  0.85 0.94 1.02 0.97 0.98 0.91 0.89 0.95 0.97 0.87 0.76 0.77  Other Operating Exp to  Average Business 0.68 0.76 0.85 0.81 0.81 0.75 0.73 0.76 0.72 0.65 0.56 0.56  16. As indicated by Table 2 above, banking productivity in terms of staff costs has  seen a considerable improvement during 1992-2013. Interestingly, there has been a  significant convergence of these ratios across various bank groups (Tables in Annex).  While the ratios have increased over this period in case of foreign banks and new  private banks, the ratios have seen a considerable decline in case of PSBs.   5 Profitability/ turnover based Parameters  Table 3     Selected Ratios                                           (figs in %)  Year 1992 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013  Net Interest Margin  3.30 2.65 3.26 3.40 3.03 3.06 2.91 3.08 2.86 2.62 2.91 2.79  Gross Income to Avg.

The NIMs of banks saw a decline from 3.30% in 1992 to 2.79% in 2013.  Importantly, the NIMs of Nationalized banks were considerably lower than that of other  bank groups and stood at 2.39% in 2013, while foreign banks and new private banks  had NIMs of 3.89% and 3.32% respectively (Tables in Annex). The higher NIMs  indicated greater intermediation spread charged by banks and could be viewed as a  cost. Banks need to develop the capability to viably carry out their operations with lower  NIMs as this would be essential in providing low cost services to the excluded groups.  18. It is evident that improved productivity and efficiency has positively impacted the  profitability levels of the banking system. However, as I would be alluding to later, the  same has been due to structural changes in banks balance sheet. The higher  profitability parameters also indicate that the benefits of improved efficiency have not  been passed on to the customers and have, instead, been retained by banks for higher  profits and provisioning.  19. Thus, the key observations from the analysis of productivity trends in Indian  banking are:   On both cost and profitability based parameters, the productivity and efficiency of  banks has seen a definite improvement over the last two decades.    At a bank group level, PSBs have performed better than new private banks and  foreign banks on various benchmarks.   However, the progress has not been constant and continuous over this period.  There have been phases of rapid and slow growths.      6 Four Phases of Productivity Growth  20.  In order to better understand the productivity trends in the banking system, the  post reform time line in India may be divided into distinct phases based on various  internal and external developments which impacted the banking sector.   Phase 1 (Pre-1995): This phase represents the period immediately after the  economic reforms. Besides the challenges posed by the changes in business  environment due to the reforms, banks also had to adjust to changes in regulatory  norms.   Phase 2 (1995-2001): This was a period of stabilization post reforms and was  characterized by developments like computerization, formulation of strategies for  technology implementation, challenges of NPAs and banks approaching markets for  capital.    Phase 3 (2001-2007): This was the growth phase when the impact of reforms was  fully felt. This period was characterized by technology upgradation by banks, benefit  of global liquidity and a period of growth. This was also the phase of build-up of risks  due to the irrational exuberance exhibited by market players.   Phase 4 (2007-2013): This last phase is dominated by the global financial crisis and  post crisis pains. The risks building up in the previous phase crystallized during this  period. The period is also characterized by reforms fatigue, lack of banking  penetration, absence of internal reforms and ineffective structure, systems and  people.  21.  In view of the considerable inter-year variations in various productivity indicators,  analysis of the same has been done over the above four phases in order to identify  trends. For this purpose, averages of various parameters over the relevant period have  been considered.        7   Table 4  Operating Expenses Ratios (%) Pre 1995 1995-2001 2001-2007 2007-2013  Avg.

Net Income 21.9 20.2 20.5 20.2  The key observations that emerge from the analysis of expenses across the four  phases are:   There is definite evidence of productivity and efficiency gains in Indian banking. This  productivity gain has led to strengthening of balance sheets of banks.   The gap between PSBs and other bank groups on various productivity parameters  has considerably narrowed. Though there were initial concerns that PSBs will lose  out to competition from the new private banks and foreign banks, it is commendable  that PSBs have responded well to the challenge and have succeeded in raising their  efficiency levels. In case of new private banks, expense ratios remain high as they  are in an expansionary phase.   The pace of productivity gains has varied with the greatest progress being seen in  Phase 3 (2001-2007), while lower gains were witnessed in the initial two phases. It is  observed that the productivity gains started tapering off in the fourth phase.   Within operating expenses, it is observed that staff expenses have improved faster  than other operating expenses. Currently, other operating expenses of PSBs  continue to remain considerably lower than new private banks and foreign banks.  This is largely due to the fact that they have not paid adequate attention to the  physical infrastructure and the ambience at branches. However, this ratio is also  expected to converge in the future.  8  Interestingly, in phase 4, PSBs have emerged as the highest per employee staff  expenses among Indian bank groups. This clearly indicates that they have lost the  staff cost advantage of the past. However, they have saved on aggregate staff  expenses by curtailing staff deployment with the use of technology.  Global Comparison  22.  While we have made some progress on the productivity front, it is important to  benchmark the Indian banking system against global productivity standards in order to  get a better understanding of where we stand.         Table 5                                             Global Comparison                                          (figs.

For instance, in case of Ratio of  Operating Cost to Assets, China (0.80%), Malaysia (1.27%) and Korea (1.05%) have  much lower ratios as compared to the Indian position of 1.65%. Considering the fact  that we are pursuing the mission of extending access to affordable banking services to  the unbanked poor, we need to target a level which is at par, if not better than many of  these countries.   23.  Our Net Interest Margin at 2.70% is also higher than that observed in many other  countries. While this would have helped in improved profitability of our banks, the higher  9 margins indicate an extent of inefficiency, which is being passed on to the ultimate  customers. On the Ratio of Net Profit to Assets, Indian banks are better than many  other jurisdictions. Considering the fact that our Operating expenses ratio are higher  than many countries, the ratio suggests that our banks have been passing on the cost  of their operational inefficiencies to their customers and are, thus, able to record greater  profits at the cost of their customers.  What has happened to Allocational Efficiency?  24.  As was observed from the analysis presented previously, the Indian banking  system has seen a perceptible improvement in its efficiency levels over the last two  decades. However, the question that I would like to pose here today is that has the  improved operational efficiency resulted in attainment of desired outcomes for all  sections of our population? I would argue that the improved operational efficiency has  not facilitated greater allocational efficiency, but has, instead, been at the cost of  allocational efficiency. Let me present some data to buttress my argument:  Table 6:                                  Population Group-wise Number of Branches of SCBs  No. of  Rural Branches as %  Year Rural Semi-urban Urban Metropolitan Total Banked  to Total Branches  Centres  1994 35329 11890 8745 5839 61803 57.16 35380  2000 32734 14407 10052 8219 65412 50.04 34830  2006 30119 15790 12159 11799 69867 43.11 34029  2010 32488 20869 16692 15451 85500 38.00 34673  2013 39073 28180 19695 18130 105078 37.18 38927  The proportion of rural branches to total branches of scheduled commercial banks  (SCBs) has seen a sharp decline from 57.16% in 1994 to 37.18% in 2013. In fact, the  number of rural branches of SCBs saw a continuous decline between 1994  2006. This  indicated a complete neglect of the requirements of rural areas by banks during this  period. It was only after a determined regulatory push towards financial inclusion that  the number of rural branches saw a perceptible rise post 2009. The failure of banks to  improve their allocational efficiency is evident from the fact that resources, in terms of  banking presence, was not allotted to the most underbanked segments i.e. the rural  areas. This was despite the fact that improving operational efficiency and access to  10 technology over this period had enhanced the capability of banks to better serve rural  habitations. Yet it appears that banks chose to ignore the need for allocational  efficiency.

The proportion of credit flowing to rural areas also  declined from 18% to 8%, while the proportion of deposits being sourced from rural  areas declined from 15.2% to 9.4% during this period. Both the above metrics highlight  the declining focus of banks on rural business and greater emphasis on business in  metro areas.

This was despite the fact that these  sectors have been receiving special attention from policy makers for some time now. As  compared to this, the proportion of credit to medium and large industries has marginally  increased from its levels in 1994, despite their contribution to GDP declining significantly  over the years. This again highlights inadequate allocational efficiency among banks  and their preference for catering to the needs of larger borrowers instead of smaller  ones.  Table 9                  Concentration of Deposit and Credit in top 10 cities  as % of total 2000 2006 2010 2012     Top 10 Top 100 Top 10 Top 100 Top 10 Top 100 Top 10 Top 100  Deposits 39.42 59.00 47.97 66.95 50.39 69.40 49.31 69.11  Credit 58.31 74.72 60.51 76.47 61.46 78.00 60.29 78.26  Another measure of inadequate allocational efficiency among banks is the concentration  of deposit/ credit indicated by the proportion held by top 10/100 cities as compared to  total deposit/ credit. Based on this measure, there has not been any improvement in  concentration of credit, which has remained largely unchanged over this period at  around 60%, while concentration of deposits saw a considerable deterioration from 39%  to 49%. The concentration indicated by the proportion of credit/ deposit to top 100 cities  has also been steadily increasing over this period. This clearly indicates that smaller  towns/ cities and rural areas were being deprived of credit/ deposit services by banks,  adversely impacting economic growth opportunities available to them.

During  this period, the proportionate amount of deposits held by individuals saw a steep decline  from 77% to 51%. The declining share of individuals in deposits, both in terms of  number and amount reinforces the fact that banks have been losing their focus on  smaller customers and are increasingly moving towards servicing bigger clients.

The outstanding credit in these  accounts as a proportion of total credit also declined from 18.3% to a mere 1.6%.  Similarly, proportion of amount outstanding in small loans upto ` 0.2 million to total  loans also declined from 30.5% to 9.5% during this period. The decline in smaller loan  accounts, which often cater to the needs of the poor and marginalized sections of the  society, again highlights the fact that banks have largely focused on catering to the  needs of the bigger borrowers, which is against the principles of allocational efficiency.  Predictably, the proportion of amount outstanding in high value loans (limit > `1000mn)  increased from 10% to 31% during this period.  25.  A similar analysis in case of term deposit accounts reveals that the proportion of  accounts with deposit less than ` 0.1 mn declined from 93.6% to 73.7% between 2002 -  13 2012. Importantly, the proportion of amount involved in such deposit accounts saw a  sizeable decline from 46.8% to 10.9% during this decade. Based on the above trends in  credit and deposit accounts, it is fair to conclude that banking in India has been  increasingly oriented towards wholesale business. It appears to be losing its focus on  retail and small value business. Here, I would like to remind our bankers that one of the  lessons from the global financial crisis was that small value and retail business proved  to be a source of stability and that banks focusing heavily on wholesale business were  the most severely impacted in the crisis.  What has Not Happened?  26.  From the above data on various parameters, it is apparent that improving  efficiencies in the Indian banking system have not had the desired beneficial impact on  all segments of the population. This clearly implies that allocational efficiency has not  kept pace with operational efficiency and, in fact, I may say that operational efficiency  has been achieved at the cost of allocational efficiency. The gains from improving  operational efficiency have not reached the customers, particularly the small customers  or the poor and marginalized groups. In terms of geographical spread, these gains have  not reached the rural areas and have largely remained restricted to the metropolitan  areas and larger cities. It is regrettable to note that despite the improvements made in  operational efficiency, the problems of disparities in Indian banking and low penetration  continue unabated.   27.  While it was expected that greater competition and adoption of new technology  would result in all round efficiency improvement in the banking system, it is again  apparent that whatever limited competition that the banks have been exposed to and  the technological progress has not resulted in bringing down the costs of providing  banking services. I would like to pose the question that is a financial system with high  operational efficiency but low allocational efficiency sustainable in the long run?  Why has it not happened?  28.  There are several reasons that can be attributed to this trend of declining  allocational efficiency against improving operational efficiency. Let me list a few:  14  The basic reason for the declining allocational efficiency is the lack of banking  penetration in the country. This has resulted in the denial of basic banking services such  as provision of savings and credit facilities to large segments of our population.    As was seen from the data analysis also, banks seem to be increasingly focusing on  wholesale business and have reduced their emphasis on individuals and segments  such as agriculture and small industries. This trend has adversely impacted allocational  efficiency as the same demands that the needs of the smaller customers be prioritized  while allocating banking resources.   While new technology has been adopted by banks in India, including migration to  CBS, the beneficial impact of technological progress on the productivity of banks is still  low when compared with global standards. This can largely be attributed to the fact that  banks have not succeeded in leveraging technology to create products, business  models and delivery channels that maximize productivity and efficiency.   Most importantly, technological progress has not been accompanied by internal  reforms in banks. Banks have not attempted to carry out comprehensive Business  Process and Structure Reengineering to ensure that internal processes are realigned by  leveraging technology with the goal of weeding out redundant processes and  simplifying/ automating others.  What have we done?  29.  Ensuring greater levels of allocational efficiency in the economy has been one of  the important priorities for policy makers and regulators. In fact, it is difficult to envisage  the long term sustenance of a social or financial system where large scale disparities  and inequalities exist. Hence, allocational efficiency, focusing on the needs and  expectations of the excluded groups, has been receiving the attention of the  Government and Reserve Bank. I would like to highlight some of the steps taken to  ensure greater allocational efficiency in banking operations:  (i)  Prescription of priority sector norms requiring banks to lend a certain part of their  credit to sectors of the economy which, in the absence of these norms, would not  receive adequate credit. With the revision in the priority sector norms in 2012, the same  15 have been rationalized and larger foreign banks have also been mandated to be at par  with Indian banks on priority sector lending, in a phased manner.   (ii) Pricing norms for the priority sector business have been freed and banks are  permitted to fix interest rates on their own. This will help banks to carry out FI initiatives  in a viable and self sustaining manner, which will facilitate its scaling up. We, however,  do expect that the pricing would be non-discriminatory and would not be exploitative.  (iii) There has been a policy shift with emphasis being on greater branch expansion in  rural areas. This is in recognition of the trend of declining rural branches and the  importance of brick and mortar structures in improving allocational efficiency through FI.  Accordingly, domestic SCBs have been mandated to allocate at least 25 per cent of the  total number of branches to be opened during a year in unbanked rural centres, with the  incentive of frontloading over the Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) period.  (iv) Banks have been permitted to adopt Business Correspondents (BC) based delivery  models to effectively cover the last mile. A host of institutions have been permitted to  become BCs.  (v) A bank-led structured and planned push towards improving access and usage of the  formal financial system by the unbanked masses has been made by leveraging on  technology. Some of the FI initiatives taken in India include:    Banks have been advised to prepare Board approved FIPs. First phase of FIP for  the period 2010-2013 has been completed. Banks are now preparing the second  phase of FIPs for the period 2013-2016.   To address the issue of uneven spread of Bank branches, domestic SCBs have  been given the freedom to open branches in centres with population of less than  100,000 subject to reporting to RBI.   A high level Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee (FIAC) has been set up to  provide strategic direction to FI initiatives across various stakeholders.   In order to ensure operational efficiency and close monitoring of BC operations,  banks have been advised to open intermediate brick and mortar structures to  provide support to about 8-10 BC units at a reasonable distance of 3-4 kilometers.  16  An integrated approach has been adopted for achieving FI through financial  literacy. Various measures have been taken for the spread of financial literacy. A  National Strategy for Financial Education has been finalized. Curriculum setting  bodies are being involved for disseminating financial literacy in schools.  What Should Happen?  30.  The way forward for banks on the path towards greater productivity and  efficiency has to be two pronged. On the one hand, banks need to focus on further  improvement in operational efficiency so that they are at par with their global peers.  Concomitantly, banks also need to concentrate on improving allocational efficiency so  that the benefits of improved operational efficiency are enjoyed by all. The key  challenge will be to ensure that the two goals are synergized and allotted equal priority.  31.  There are several other measures that Indian banks need to initiate in order to  establish the balance between allocational efficiency and operational efficiency:   Banks need to initiate internal reforms in order to ensure that their systems and  processes are in a position to leverage technology to maximize productivity and  efficiency gains. For this purpose, banks need to look at large scale Business Process  and Structure Reengineering.   Transaction costs need to be reduced by fully leveraging technology. This would  include creation of new cost effective products, business models and delivery channels.   Banks need to implement robust information systems and IT architecture and  should harness the power of the IT systems for business development. Besides, a  strong IT system will also aid in adoption of better risk management practices.    Productivity improvement should benefit people at the bottom of the pyramid  through improved access to financial services and lower cost of financial access. Every  individual should have the opportunity to improve his/ her financial position by  leveraging access to the financial system. Banks have to facilitate this.  17  Banks have to reverse the tendency of focusing on wholesale business and should  ensure that agriculture, retail and SME business receive adequate attention. This is  important not just for improving financial access for the smaller and marginalized  groups, but also as a source of stability for banks.    Banks should strive to improve their pricing ability, both for liability and asset  products, with the objective of ensuring that the pricing framework is transparent, non- discriminatory and non-exploitative. The basic principle of pricing should be that the  poor and the vulnerable should not be subsidizing the provision of banking services to  the rich. Besides, an effective pricing framework can assist in building up balance sheet  strength by encouraging good business and shedding bad business. However, for all  this, banks need to develop the ability to identify risks and to build them into their pricing  frameworks.   In order to improve productivity and efficiency, banks need to be given more  flexibility in operational matters, particularly in manpower practices. In fact, I strongly  believe that HR practices at banks, particularly PSBs, need to undergo significant  change in areas such as manpower planning, job description, performance appraisal,  promotion and placement policies, performance based compensation practices, etc.  Attaining greater productivity and efficiency requires not just the right technology,  systems and processes, but also the manpower with the right skills and attitude,  demonstrating the necessary flexibility and adaptability to be able to keep pace with the  changing times. Greater emphasis has also to be laid on productivity in terms of per  branch and per employee performance.   Lastly, but most importantly, there is an urgent need for improved governance and  greater accountability across all levels of management and administration. The change  in corporate culture and the move towards true productivity and efficiency needs to be  led by managements in their respective organizations. The pace and direction of these  changes will be determined by the passion demonstrated by the management in  pursuing this change.  18 Banks have a Great Opportunity  32.  The theme of the conference alludes to the paradigms of the Next Frontier of  Productivity Excellence. To me, there are three major ingredients that contribute to  productivity excellence, viz. Technology, Processes and People. I believe that  significant opportunities lie ahead for our banks to leverage on these three components  to attain true banking productivity and efficiency i.e. both operational and allocational.  On the technology front, our banks have already implemented certain basic technology  and are all on CBS. They are, of late, also making efforts to incorporate new technology  mediums in their delivery channels. On the technology front, banks have the opportunity  to perfect their technology based delivery models so as to significantly reduce costs and  improve penetration of banking services.  33.  On the Processes front, as I had mentioned earlier, the opportunity for banks is  to carry out large scale Business Processes and Structure Reengineering in order to  reap the full benefits of technology. Here, I would emphasize the need for changing  Transactional Processes, Business Delivery Models and use of Customer Relationship  Management (CRM) tools to bolster efforts towards productivity and efficiency.  34.  On the People front, the opportunity lies in the form of large scale retirement of  bank employees that is to happen in this decade. The consequent change in manpower  profile provides a unique opportunity for banks to Right-size and Right-skill their  organizations in line with the demands of fostering greater productivity and efficiency.   Conclusion  35.  The Indian banking system has seen important productivity improvements over  the last two decades with the PSBs, in particular, bridging the gap with new private  banks and foreign banks. However, the pace of progress has declined, largely due to  lack of desired impetus. We continue to lag behind several other countries on various  productivity parameters. Our banks have to strive towards closing this gap.  36.  Banks gains in operational efficiency have, however, come at the cost of their  allocational efficiency. The improved operational efficiency has been a result of  technological progress and structural changes in balance sheet towards more  19 wholesale business. The operational efficiency gains, though profitable for the banks,  have not had the desired beneficial impact on the society as a whole, particularly the  rural areas, individuals and small businesses. I would say that the vulnerability of the  banking system has increased on account of the imbalances arising from growth in  operational efficiency without commensurate rise in allocational efficiency. Let me add  that both Reserve Bank of India and Government of India have already initiated several  corrective measures to reverse this trend by actively promoting the programme of  financial inclusion. The correction process needs to be expedited further with greater  zeal and vigor.  37.  Banks have to ensure that they attain greater allocational efficiency by extending  access to financial services to the unbanked masses and providing the excluded poor  the opportunity to leverage the financial system to improve their economic condition.  True productivity of the banking system can be judged not just by the positive impact on  banks own financials but by the impact it has on the lives of ordinary citizens. I hope the  Indian banking system rises up to the challenge of attaining productivity and efficiency  in its true sense and thereby contributes to the economic growth and prosperity of the  nation.  38.  I once again thank FICCI and IBA for inviting me to FIBAC 2013 and providing  me the opportunity to share my thoughts on this important subject. I observe that  several  of the issues raised by me here also find resonance in the report presented by  BCG today and that they will be deliberated over the two days of the conference.   I wish the conference all success. Thank you.  20   Annex* Table 1: Bank group-wise trends in Ratio of Operating Expenses to Average Total Assets  Old Pvt. New Pvt.
