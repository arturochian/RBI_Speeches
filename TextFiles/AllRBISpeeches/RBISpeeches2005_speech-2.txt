1Corporate governance in banks in IndiaFriends,I am thankful to the organisers for inviting me to give a luncheonaddress. There are several reasons why I was compelled to accept theresponsibility. First, the eminence of the presentors, namely Indian Institute ofManagement, Bangalore, International Institute of Finance and Indian Banks’Association. Second, the persuasive skills of Mr. Sinor who brings to bear thepersona of the whole banking community on any subject. Third, growingimportance being accorded to governance in banks by the Reserve Bank ofIndia (RBI) in recent years. This is a program addressed to Bank Directors ofIndian banks and RBI would like to be seen to be supportive of efforts to equipthe Directors of banks to address the commercial-cum-governance issues ingeneral and fulfil the fiduciary responsibilities implicit in being on the boards ofbanks, in particular. Since many substantive aspects of the subject are beingaddressed by highly qualified professionals, I will initially make a few generalobservations on the subject but will devote the rest to an enumeration of theReserve Bank’s recent initiatives and some thoughts on way forward.General observationsAs you are aware, corporate governance, as a subject of significance for bothpublic policy and markets, is of recent origin. It is useful to recognise that it isa dynamic concept, in terms of scope, thrust and relevance. For example, theissue is approached very differently today compared to original view of theCadbury Committee on the subject. East-Asian crisis gave a new dimensionto corporate governance in the context of financial stability. In U.S.A., theregulatory regimes, post-corporate scandals, are very different from those ofthe early 90’s. The OECD set out its corporate governance principles in 1999but revised them in 2004. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (underthe aegis of the BIS) published guidelines on corporate governance in banksin 1999. As an update, in July 2005, the Basel Committee has issued aConsultative Document on enhancing corporate governance for bankingorganisations, seeking comments by end October 2005. I would advise that                                           1 The luncheon address by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Seminaron Corporate Governance for Bank Directors organized by the Indian Institute ofManagement, Bangalore; International Institute of Finance, Washington and the Indian Banks’Association on December 16, 2005 at Hotel Taj Palace, Mumbai.this document for now and the final document when released by BIS, shouldbe a compulsory reading for all the regulators concerned and all the directorson the boards of the banks. The point to be noted is that corporategovernance should be viewed as an ongoing process subject to rapidchanges based on experiences, developments and policy-setting.There is considerable divergence in the understanding and practice ofcorporate governance in general, and in respect of banks, in particular, butthere is also an increasing tendency towards convergence. The culturalcontext may be difficult to capture but the legal, institutional and attitudinalcontexts do vary perceptibly across countries. Differences can be noticedeven amongst the industrialised countries – say between Anglo-Saxon,European and Japanese situations. At the same time, the trend towardsgreater convergence is for several reasons. The corporates are getting listedin multiple stock exchanges in different countries and carry out corporateoperations in several jurisdictions while the cross-border financial flows seekan assurance of some commonly understood standards of governance, whichhave a mutually reinforcing tendency. Banks, in particular, have been asubject of special interest for governance, especially in view of their fiduciaryrole. The cross-border operations of banks provide an added impetus forconvergence in such standards.Public policy framework in regard to corporate governance typicallyinvolves multiplicity of agencies in all countries. For instance, in India, theseare Department of Company Affairs; Securities and Exchange Board of Indiain respect of listed entities apart from the banking regulator in respect ofbanks. Harmonising their policies in a dynamic setting is a daunting task forpolicy makers and adds to the complexities of the corporates or banksconcerned to ensure compliance.In regard to sectors such as banking in India where ownership ofgovernment is dominant, there are additional issues. Government, as anowner, is accountable to political institutions in terms of broader socio-economic objectives and hence, its goals may not necessarily be compatiblewith purely economic incentives. Mixed ownership, with the government as amajor shareholder, brings into sharper focus the possible divergent objectivesof share-ownership in a corporate or a bank and issues relating to the rights ofminority shareholders. The problem gets more complex if public ownership isexercised through separate legislation and not under the Company Law,normally applicable to other competing entities. The role of directors in suchdivergent organisational settings, therefore, needs a nuanced appreciation.Let me end these general observations with an anecdote. When I wasworking in the World Bank in late 1970s, I joined the George WashingtonUniversity for getting a taste of education in a foreign university. I took acourse in management services. The Professor emphasised various aspectsof organisational behaviour. I found that the best interest of the organisationthat one serves was missing in the analysis. When I queried, he said : “it isyour boss who interprets to you, what is good for the organisation”. When Ipersisted, he added, “we deal with the corporate behaviour in the context ofnorth American male in the U.S.A.” I must confess that I continue to be old-fashioned. Any institution has, and in any case, should have a character,culture and interest that are worth pursuing even if they appear to be atvariance from the sum of the interests of the individual, or the minority or themajority stakeholders. I will leave this thought of viewing corporategovernance in broader terms extending beyond its immediate constituentstakeholders on the few occasions when a divergence in interests might arise.With this, let me move on to what we have been doing in RBI on this subject.Reserve Bank’s approachThe formal policy announcement in regard to corporate governancewas first made by my distinguished predecessor, Dr. Bimal Jalan in the Mid-Term Review of the Monetary and Credit Policy on October 21, 2001.Pursuant to this announcement, a Consultative Group was constituted inNovember 2001 under the Chairmanship of Dr. A.S. Ganguly : basically, witha view to strengthen the internal supervisory role of the Boards. An AdvisoryGroup on Corporate Governance under the chairmanship of Dr. R.H. Patil hadearlier submitted its report in March 2001 which examined the issues relatingto corporate governance in banks in India including the public sector banksand made recommendations to bring the governance standards in India onpar with the best international standards.  There were also some relevantobservations by the Advisory Group on Banking Supervision under thechairmanship, Shri M.S. Verma which submitted its report in January 2003.Keeping all these recommendations in view and the cross-country experience,the Reserve Bank initiated several measures to strengthen the corporategovernance in the Indian banking sector.In June 2002, the report of the Ganguly Group was transmitted to allthe banks for their consideration while simultaneously transmitting it to theGovernment of India for appropriate consideration.  It may be noted here thatthere is a basic difference between the private sector banks and public sectorbanks as far as the Reserve Bank’s role in governance matters relevant tobanking is concerned.  The current regulatory framework ensures, by andlarge, uniform treatment of private and public sector banks by the ReserveBank in so far as prudential aspects are concerned. However, some of thegovernance aspects of public sector banks, though they have a bearing onprudential aspects, are exempt from applicability of the relevant provisions ofthe B.R. Act, as they are governed by the respective legislations under whichvarious public sector banks were set up. In brief, therefore, the approach ofRBI has been to ensure, to the extent possible, uniform treatment of the publicsector and the private sector banks in regard to prudential regulations.  Inregard to governance aspects relevant to banking, the Reserve Bankprescribes its policy framework for the private sector banks while suggestingto the Government the same framework for adoption, as appropriate,consistent with the legal and policy imperatives.As a follow-up of the Ganguly Committee report, in Mid-Term Reviewof the Monetary and Credit Policy in November 2003, the concept of ‘fit andproper’ criteria for directors of banks was formally enunciated, and it includedthe process of collecting information, exercising due diligence and constitutionof a Nomination Committee of the board to scrutinise the declarations madeby the bank directors.  In this regard, it will be useful to refer to the RBIguidelines on ownership and governance in the private sector banks releasedrecently.It is heartening to note that based on the guidelines issued by RBI, allthe banks in the private sector have carried out, through their nominationcommittees, the exercise of due diligence in respect of the directors on theirBoards.  In some cases, where the track record of the directors was notconsidered satisfactory, the directors vacated their positions. In regard tosome others, there is an on-going process to ensure ‘fit and proper’ status ofthe directors.In this regard, it may be useful to distinguish the issue of thecomposition of the Board from the ‘fit and proper’ status of individual non-executive directors and chief executives.  The first relates to collectiveexpertise on the Board available to meet the competitive challenges beforethe bank to ensure commercial activity while maintaining soundness. Theexisting legal provisions in regard to banks stipulate specific areas ofbackground that a director should be drawn from such as accountancy,banking, economics, finance, agriculture, etc., but do not specify the extent ordegree of professionalism or expertise required in regard to that area.  Hence,it is left to the good faith of the shareholders to elect directors from the variousspecified areas with qualifications and experience that is appropriate to thebank. In regard to public sector banks, such good faith is expected whendirectors are nominated by government.However, when the issue of ‘fit and proper’ status of non-executivedirectors comes up, the norms only seek to ensure that the candidate shouldnot have come to the adverse notice of the law and regulations or anyprofessional body so that there is no objection from the RBI. In the case ofnon-executive directors not satisfying the ‘fit and proper’ criteria, there is aprescribed due process to be followed by the RBI to disqualify such directors,which includes opportunities to be heard. The position in regard to the CEOsof the private sector banks is on a different footing where the Reserve Bank isin a position to exercise its judgement on the suitability of the candidatesproposed, in as much as the approval of the Reserve Bank is required for theappointment and the RBI may seek removal also. These provisions arebroadly consistent with global best practices though there is scope forenhancing effective implementation.There is no legal provision as of now for the Reserve Bank to insist onthe ‘fit and proper’ status of the directors nominated by the government orelected by the shareholders to the Boards of the public sector banks. Theappointment of the CEOs in the public sector banks, as well as their removal,is also a matter to be decided only by the Government of India. There is,however, active consultation with the Reserve Bank in regard to appointmentof CEOs. Thus, by and large, there is de facto compliance with manygovernance requirements in public sector banks. .Way forwardAs a step towards distancing the regulator from the functioning of theBoards, the Reserve Bank has withdrawn its nominee directors from almostall the private sector banks. Observers have been appointed as a transitionalmeasures mostly in respect of those banks which are yet to fully comply withthe Reserve Bank’s guidelines of ownership of governance.  It is hoped thatthe need for observers also will diminish as the quality of governanceimproves.Second, legislative amendments have been proposed in regard to thepublic sector banks to remove the provisions for mandatory nomination of RBIofficers on their boards and thus, to bring them on par with the private sectorbanks in this regard.Third, the Government has been requested to keep in view the policyframework for governance in private sector banks while deciding on theappointments of the directors on the Boards’ of public sector banks andconstitution of various committees of the Board.Fourth, the RBI, as far as possible, has recently been refraining fromissuing circulars or instructions specifically addressed to the public sectorbanks.  It is expected that all the existing instructions specifically applicable tothe public sector banks will be reviewed by the Reserve Bank so thatuniformity in regulatory framework between different categories of banks isformally established.Fifth, several amendments to the Banking Regulation Act have beenproposed which would enhance RBI’s capacity to ensure sound governancespecially relevant to the banks, consistent with global best practices.In regard to urban co-operative banks (UCBs), there are uniqueproblems which need to be addressed. Since all the governance aspects ofurban co-operative banks fall entirely within the jurisdiction of the StateGovernments, while only prudential aspects are in the RBI’s domain, it hasbeen difficult to ensure effective co-ordination owing to the problems of dualcontrol in the matters of governance which have a bearing on prudentialregulation. Further, the market discipline in terms of shareholders’ influenceon governance does not exist in regard to urban co-operative banks sincethey do not depend on equity markets for their funds. Moreover, thegovernance structure in the UCBs seems to be tilted in favour of theborrowers from the UCBs, thus, possibly undermining the interest of thedepositors. Currently, to avoid problems of dual control, a mechanism ofMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the State Governments, is beingattempted. RBI has entered into such MoUs with Andhra Pradesh, Gujaratand Karnataka and is providing facilities for upgrading the skills of themembers of the Board and the management of the UCBs, in these States.The problem of dual control is even more acute in regard to the ruralco-operative credit structure.  However, these are being currently addressedby the Government of India in the light of the recommendations of theVaidyanathan Committee.The RRBs are yet another category of banks which are actually owned,in a pre-determined pattern, by the State, Centre and the sponsor banks.  Thesponsor banks are virtually managing the RRBs and the issues of governanceof these institutions are yet to be addressed. Deposit taking NBFCs and,perhaps, NBFCs with systemic implications may also need to be consideredfor a careful review of their current governance practices in view of theirunique role and expanding importance in our financial sector.ConclusionLet me conclude with a reiteration that the Reserve Bank iscontinuously striving to ensure compliance with international standards andbest practices of corporate governance in banks as relevant to India. RBI isalso interacting closely with the Government and the SEBI in this regard.Increasing regulatory comfort in regard to standards of governance in banksgives greater confidence to shift from external regulation to internal systemsof controls and risk-management. Each of the directors of the banks has arole in continually enhancing the standards of governance in banks through acombination of appropriate knowledge and values.Thank you.
