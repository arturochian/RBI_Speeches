I am thankful to the organisers for their perseverance in getting me to I am using this opportunity to share with you some explanations on the Monetary andCredit Policy for 2001-02 announced last week.  This is the fifth Annual Policy ofReserve Bank of India (RBI) that I have been associated with, and soon after everyone of the fine statements, I had publicly articulated some explanations.  The purposehas generally been to highlight elements of continuity, change and contextualrelevance in each policy.  However, on this occasion, a slightly different approach isadopted.  To start with, there will be an assessment of the projections made in thepolicy statements since 1997-98 with reference to outcomes, giving some sort ofmonetary marksmanship, akin though not similar to fiscal marksmanship.  This willbe followed by a brief review of the progress in reforms in monetary policy andfinancial markets during the last five years.  The features of the latest Monetary andCredit Policy would then be mentioned to lead to the tasks ahead.  The tasks ahead,following from the recent policy statement are presented in four sections, viz., forReserve Bank of India ; for Government of India, for market participants and forProjections and The monetary projections and underlying assumptions in regard to the macro-economy are contained in the annual statements, and revised, if considered necessary,in mid-year review in October.  An analysis of projections and actual out turn since1997-98 would help appreciate the realism in the analysis as well as the overall macroBroadly speaking, the following inferences ca n be drawn from such anFirst, the outturn in regard to growth in Gross Domestic Product has beenclose to the projections indicated in the Policy Statement and/or mid-year reviewexcept in 1997-98, when it touched the lowest level at 5.0 per cent.Second, anticipated inflation has been out of alignment (i.e. beyond onehundred basis points from the projection) only in respect of 1999-2000, when itpeaked at 6.8 per cent.Third, the growth in money supply has b een consistently above the projectedrate except in 1999-2000, when it was at 14.6 per cent, below the projected level of15.5-16.0 per cent.Fourth, the deposit growth has been higher than projected in all the yearsexcept in 1999-2000 when the growth was a mere 13.9 per cent compared to theprojected level of 16.5 per cent.                                                       management.analysis (see Table attached for details).Outcomes : An Assessmenttechnical work on some relevant areas of significance.Chennai.and Financial Markets*Developments in Monetary PolicyFifth, the growth of non-food credit {including investments in PSU bonds,corporate debentures, Commercial Paper (CP) etc.} has generally been less thanSixth, in regard to interest rates, the general preference has been to bring downor soften interest rates while focussing on stability, though no specific rates wereindicated.  There has been a reduction every year, the range measured by PrimeLending Rates of public sector banks, having come down from 14.0 to 14.5 per centSeventh, the market borrowing programme of the union government exceededthe projections (as per budget estimates) in all the years except in 2000-01, and therehas been a significant borrowing in the fortnight following the end of the fiscal year.In fact, the slippage in 1998-99 and 1999-2000 had been very large, being aboutRs. 15,000 crore, accounting for about 0.75 per cent of GDP.  The borrowingprogramme of State Governments has been consistently higher than originallyEighth, as regards external sector, the current account deficit has beenconsistently less than 2.0 per cent of GDP, strictly in consonance with the broadpolicy indications.  In fact, it has been significantly lower and at 1.5 per cent or less inNinth, the policy objective of augmenting reserves has also been achieved inevery one of the years and the total addition to foreign currency reserves during theperiod at U.S.$ 17 billion far exceeded the total addition to external debt (includingamounts raised under Resurgent India Bonds and India Millennium Deposits) ofFinally, the conditions in forex markets appear to have been reasonably stable,though there have been several occasions when there were pressures warrantingThere is no doubt that the actual outcomes depend upon several uncertaintiesand unanticipated events that characterise any policy making during any givenmedium- term frame.  The period under consideration had to contend with severaldomestic and international events that were unexpected, viz., domestic politicaluncertainties due to Parliamentary elections, Asian crisis, sanctions against India bythe USA, border conflict at Kargil and oil shock or large increase in price ofpetroleum.  Surely, there are lessons to be learnt and elements of good luck that mighthave visited on occasions but the period also exhibited exercise of sound judgementsand enhancement of skills in management at all levels within RBI.  What is of greatersignificance is the fact that the monetary policy was conducted while bringing aboutsignificant structural improvements in the financial sector and developing financialmarkets, especially the money market and the government securities market.Monetary management was greatly facilitated by the solid foundations laid and soundpolicy framework created by the RBI during the early nineties preceding the periodReview of Progress (1996-2001 )2analysed.prompt actions by RBI.U.S.$ 4.5 billion.all the years.indicated to RBI except during 1997-98.in 1997-98 to 10.0 to 13.0 per cent in 2000-01.projected in all the years.The main objectives of the policy measures during 1996-2001 have been toincrease operational effectiveness of monetary policy by broadening and deepeningvarious segments of the financial market, to redefine the regulatory role of theReserve Bank, to strengthen prudential and supervisory norms, to improve the creditdelivery system, and to develop the technological and institutional infrastructure foran efficient financial sector.  These measures usually announced as part of PolicyStatements help the market agents to appreciate the policy changes in offing and toprepare themselves to meet possible challenges. In evolving these measures, marketThe recent experience shows that monetary management in terms ofobjectives, framework and instruments has undergone significant changes, reflectingbroadly the transition of Indian economy from a regulated to liberalised andderegulated regime.  In that context, it would be worth the while to address some ofthe major highlights of these changes and the related issues which have receivedFirst, during this period the twin objectives of monet ary policy of maintainingprice stability and ensuring availability of adequate credit to productive sectors of theeconomy to support growth have remained unchanged; the relative emphasis on eitherof these objectives also continues to depend on the circumstances.  However, thegradual liberalization of financial markets has increased the potential risks andvulnerability of institutions and has, therefore, implications for financial stability.The linkages between financial stability and price stability have become pronouncedin recent times.  In this context, the recent policy measures laid emphasis inter aliaupon maintaining orderly conditions and containing volatility in financial markets.While the market determined exchange rate system has implications for monetarypolicy, the international transmission of price changes also need to be recognized inunderstanding the inflationary process.   The structure of the economy and the role ofservices sector have also been changing which have implications for transmission ofSecond, though inflation is not targeted, policy statements including those inthe reference period, have been identifying a tolerable level of inflation taking intoaccount the global trends and domestic compulsions.  The measurement issues havealso come to the fore and the notions of core-inflation and underlying inflation asagainst headline have been subjects of discussion.  There has also been somesensitivity in the market, to the issues relating to measurement of prices in thegrowing services sector as also asset prices.  A national consensus on the need toThird, in a deregulated environment, besides the provision of adequate credit,availability of adequate resources at appropriate costs, i.e., interest rates becomesmore important.  Stable and preferably a low interest rate regime is conditional uponenabling stable inflationary expectations, which in turn depends on price stability.During the period, the fiscal and other constraints inhibiting the downward flexibilityin interest rates had been debated and the need to impart flexibility to interest rateshas emerged as a focal point for policy action.  Consequently, there is widespreadappreciation of the efforts to ensure reduction in existing high levels of revenuedeficit and fiscal deficit, besides rationalising administered interest rates on3emphasize price stability in macro policy seems to be emerging.monetary policy.added and focused attention in recent years.participants are closely associated and consulted.contractual savings to impart efficiency and operational flexibility to the financialsector.During this period, most interest rates have been deregulated.  The fewprescriptions that exist, viz., export credit, small loans, foreign currency deposits arein the nature of ceilings related to market interest rates such as the relevant PrimeLending Rate (PLR) of the concerned bank or the LIBOR of the concerned currency.Currently, the only administered interest rate is on saving deposits.  While directedcredit continues, the conditions attached to such credit dispensation have been madeFourth, the monetary policy framework in India from mid-1980s till 1997-98,can, by and large, be characterised as a monetary targeting framework on the linesrecommended by Chakravarty Committee (1985). Because of reasonable stability ofthe money demand function, the annual growth in broad money (M ) was used as an3intermediate target of monetary policy to achieve monetary objectives.  In practice,unlike many other countries, which followed such an approach, the monetarytargeting approach was used in a flexible manner with a ‘feedback’. This wasnecessary partly because of high level of government borrowings and the fiscaldominance, administered interest rates and the large size of unorganized sector.Deregulation and liberalization of the financial markets combined with increasingopenness of the economy during this period necessitated some changes in thisframework.  Consequently, a multiple indicator approach was announced in 1998-99,wherein interest rates or rates of return in different markets (money, capital andgovernment securities markets) along with such data as on currency, credit extendedby banks and financial institutions, fiscal position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate,exchange rate, refinancing and transactions in foreign exchange available on highfrequency basis are juxtaposed with output data for drawing policy perspectives.Such a shift was gradual and a logical outcome of measures taken over the reformThus the ‘exclusive’ use of broa d money as an intermediate target was de-emphasised, but the growth in broad money  (M ) continues to be used as an3important indicator of monetary policy.  In a deregulated financial environment withreasonably open capital account, monetary policy has to respond to unexpectedchanges on short-term basis.  The switchover to a multiple indicator approachprovided necessary flexibility to the Reserve Bank to respond to changes in domesticand international economic and financial market conditions more effectively. In amedium to long-term perspective, the impact of money supply on inflation, however,cannot be ignored and for purposes of policy, the Reserve Bank still continues toannounce projections of money supply compatible with the outlook on growth ofFifth, the institutional context in which monetary policy was conducted wasvastly different till very recently. Since 1997, a major change has taken place with thediscontinuation of the process of automatic monetisation of government deficit.Although the mutually agreed Ways and Means Advances (WMA) sought to put alimit on direct short-term access of funds from the Reserve Bank to the Government,the continued high fiscal deficit made it difficult for the Government to reduce itsrequirement of borrowings from the banking sector.  In the process, the Reserve Bankhad to manage liquidity in the system in such a way that the impact of the high fiscal4GDP and expected inflation.period since early nineties.considerably flexible.deficit on monetisation as also on interest rates is minimized.  In effect, while thefiscal impact on monetisation has been reduced significantly, the interplay betweenThe overall monetary management becomes difficult with a large and growingborrowing programme of the government, year after year, which puts pressure on theabsorptive capacity of the market.  The banking system at end-March 2001 heldgovernment securities of around 35.0 per cent of its net demand and time liabilities asagainst the minimum statutory requirement of 25.0 per cent.  In terms of volume, suchholdings above the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) amounted to as much as,00,000 crore, which is substantially higher than the net annual borrowings of thegovernment. Si xth, in addition to the changes in the monetary policy framework, targetsand indicators, and the institutional context in which monetary policy is beingconducted over the past five years, a major transformation has also taken place in theoperating procedure of monetary policy.  The reform of monetary and financialsectors has enabled the Reserve Bank to expand the array of instruments at itsThe reliance on reserve requirements, particularly the cash reserve ratio(CRR), has been reduced as an instrument of monetary control.  The CRR has beenbrought down, notwithstanding intra-year variations, from a peak of 15.0 per cent in1994-95 to 8.0 percent in 2000-01.  The objective of policy is to reduce CRR to itsstatutory minimum of 3.0 per cent over a period of time. The Statutory LiquidityRatio has already been brought down to its statutory minimum of 25.0 per cent.The liquidity management in the system is carried out through open  marketoperations (OMO) in the form of outright purchases/sales of government securitiesand repo and reverse repo operations.  The OMO are supplemented by access to theReserve Bank’s standing facilities and direct interest rate signals through changes inrepo rates.For transmitting signals of monetary policy, the Bank Rate was initiallyoperationalised as a signaling and reference rate for influencing the interest rates inthe economy.  Interest rates on advances from the Reserve Bank were linked to theBank Rate.  Refinance/liquidity support at the Bank Rate and repo rates were intendedto serve as a ceiling and a floor, respectively, setting an informal  corridor for moneymarket particularly the call money market to operate.  In the context of the continuedlarge market borrowing programme of the government, the Reserve Bank onoccasions adopted a policy of strategically accepting private placement of governmentsecurities and then releasing those to the market at an appropriate time without puttingundue pressure on interest rates.In terms o f further progress in the use of market-based instruments, a liquidityBank to modulate short term liquidity under varied financial market conditions inorder to ensure stable conditions in the overnight (call) money market.  The LAFoperates through repo and reverse repo auctions thereby setting a corridor for theshort-term interest rate consistent with policy objectives.  The LAF operationscombined with strategic open market operations consistent with market liquidity5adjustment facility (LAF) was introduced in June 2000.  The LAF enables the Reservethe Bank Rate/command.Rs.1fiscal and monetary operations continued to be significant in the post-1997 scenario.conditions has evolved as the principal operating procedure of monetary policy of theReserve Bank.  The next stage of development in this direction aims to move towardsa full-fledged LAF by gradually removing/minimizing standing facilities, thusproviding appropriate conditions for the Reserve Bank to exercise greater degree offreedom in providing a direction on interest rates to the market. Seventh, the emerging linkages among money, governme nt securities andforeign exchange markets require the Reserve Bank at times to use short-termmonetary measures alongside intervention to arrest excessive volatilities in foreignexchange market. While there is no settled conclusion about the appropriateness of anexchange rate regime within the broad range of corner solutions of ‘free float’ and a‘currency  board’, in the present market determined exchange rate regime, the primaryobjective of the Reserve Bank continues to be the maintenance of orderly conditionsin the foreign exchange market, meeting temporary supply-demand gaps which mayarise due to uncertainties or other reasons, and curbing destabilizing and self-fulfillingspeculative activities.  To this end, the Reserve Bank monitors closely thedevelopments in the financial markets at home and abroad and takes such measures,The recent experience has highlighted the importance of building up foreignexchange reserves to take care of unforeseen contingencies, volatile capital flows andother developments, which can affect expectations adversely.  The emergingeconomies have to rely largely on their own resources during external exigencies (orcontagion) as there is no international “lender of last resort” to provide additionalliquidity at short notice on acceptable terms.  Thus, the need for adequate reserves isunlikely to be eliminated or reduced even if exchange rates are allowed to float freely.The overall approach to the management of India’s foreign exchange reserves inrecent years has reflected the changing composition of balance of payments, and hasendeavoured to reflect the “liquidity risks” associated with different types of flowsFinally, the gradual switchover to indirect market-based instruments in theconduct of monetary policy was made possible because of simultaneous efforts atdeveloping various segments of the financial market, particularly money, foreignexchange and government securities market.The increasing responsibility of the Reserve Bank of India in undertakingreform in the financial markets has to be seen essentially in the context of improvingthe effectiveness of the transmission channel of monetary policy. Development offinancial markets has, therefore, encompassed regulatory and legal changes, buildingup of institutional infrastructure, constant fine-tuning in market microstructure andmassive upgradation of technological infrastructure.  An important achievement inthis area was the amendment to the Securities Contracts Regulation Act, whichclarified the regulatory jurisdiction of RBI over the money, government securities andforex segments of the financial market.The money market is critical in facilitating the conduct of monetary policy andin improving the transmission mechanism. This requires the RBI to have greatercontrol over the liquidity in the system, create an efficient mechanism to impartinterest rate signals and undertake continuous refinements to money marketinstruments. The market for repo is being scientifically developed over a period6and other contingencies.as it considers necessary from time to time.           through widening of participants and instruments, and by bringing uniformity intrading and accounting practices with the help of Fixed Income Money Market andDerivatives Association of India (FIMMDA). A Clearing Corporation has beenproposed, so that repo operations could become efficient with adequate safeguards.Similarly, RBI has been closely nurturing the Treasury Bill market. It has increasedthe range of T-Bills over the years, modified the notified amounts and incorporatedchanges in the auction formats to suit the needs of the market. The efficacy ofCommercial Paper and Certificates of Deposit has also been improved over the yearswith measures such as reduction in the minimum period and amount of issue, lock-inperiod, preferring dematerialised form, etc. The most important reform in the moneymarket relates to the initiation of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). With theannouncement of the second phase of LAF, the RBI has moved gradually from asystem of segmented refinance to a more fungible system of liquidity adjustment atmarket related rates. Reform in the call money market has also been announced toIn the Government Securities market, the borrowing programme of theGovernment has been systematised and rationalised with the establishment of cashand Debt Management Group consisting of officials from RBI and the Governmentand could be completed without destabilizing the financial markets. Changes havebeen incorporated in the formats of auction by combining both price-based and yield-based auctions, thereby improving the fungibility and liquidity and paving the way forthe development of a market for STRIPS, elongating the maturity for debt, facilitatingthe emergence of benchmarks, etc. The institutional infrastructure has beenstrengthened by increasing the number of Primary Dealers and making themfunctionally stronger through imposition of capital adequacy norms and otherprudential norms. PDs have been made more vibrant through careful modulation ofresponsibilities and facilities. Changes in valuation norms for banks’ investmentportfolio have been introduced and RBI has moved away from announcing the yieldcurve for government securities, which is now the responsibility of FIMMDA. Furtherdevelopment of the government securities market hinges on legal reforms proposedby RBI and completion of the technological upgradation process that has alreadyMeasures initiated to integrate the Indian  market with global financialsystem include permitting banks to fix their own position limits and aggregate gaplimits, to borrow from and invest abroad up to 15 per cent of Tier I capital, and toarrange to hedge risks for corporate clients through derivative instruments. Given thelack of depth and liquidity in the forex market, the aim is to remove theseA hallmark of the reform process in the financial markets is the consensusbuilding, which is operationalised through inter-departmental working groups, inter-agency committees and Technical Advisory Committees at the formulation stages andFinancial Markets Committee at the monitoring stage. The aim is to involve all thestakeholders in the formulation and implementation stages. Greater deregulationunderscores the importance of closer monitoring of market developments by theregulator. This is institutionalised in the form of Financial Markets Committee (FMC)in the RBI, which meets daily before the opening of the markets and at times on morethan one occasion, when situation warrants.

This institutionalizedframework helps the RBI to take an integrated view on all important decisions havingThe presentation has not covered important areas relating to prudentialregulation, supervision and credit delivery, though they do constitute very criticalThe Policy has to take into account the macro-economic and monetarydevelopments of the previous year.  Since last year, a separate detailed document isprepared on the subject, which is a highly recommended reading for serious analysts.This document was issued on April 19, 2001 along with the Statement of the Policyfor 2001-02.The statement itself explains in detail the developments in 200 0-01 as well asthe projections and outcomes for 2001-02. What is noteworthy is the nuance in thestance of monetary policy, which gives greater emphasis than in the past to (a) creditgrowth and revival of investment demand; and (b) the interest rate flexibility.  Thismay be described as the contextual response at macro-policy level. At micro level,there are contextual measures such as those relating to urban cooperative banks, andThe second set of measures would emphasise the continuation of some aspects of policy.  Changes are sought in the liquidity adjustment facility, call moneymarket, repo market and export re-finance.  The set of measures when fullyimplemented in the next two to three years would mean completion of the transitiontowards indirect instruments of monetary policy, and imparting greater effectivenessof monetary policy transmission.  To illustrate, at present, banks get liquidity fromnon-banks and also from RBI.  In fact, RBI is currently obliged to provide eligibleamount of liquidity at predetermined rate which gives greater freedom to banks butcorrespondingly constrains the operations of RBI.  Further, now -day liquiditycannot be handled by the RBI.  The package of measures announced now would takecare of these issues and carry the operating environment of monetary policy toSimilarly, in the area of institutional and technological infrastructure forfinancial markets, the full implementation of computerisation of Public Debt Officeand operationalisation of Clearing Corporation during the course of the yearrepresents culmination of medium term efforts to instill international standards.Incidentally, the modern forex clearing operations proposed in India are pioneering,outside of America and Europe, with Hong Kong becoming operational last year.There will be enormous savings in time and cost of intra bank forex transactions inIndia.  Corporates, mutual funds etc. can operate in the repo market, i.e., access orprovide collateralised liquidity for the very short term, with all safeguards.

With this, the erstwhilenon-transparent practices of circumventing PLR when it was a floor, as applied tocreditworthy borrowers may end.  Also, this gives greater scope for banks to meetIn the area of prudential standards, markets carry on impression that the levelof Non Performing Assets is understated on account of 180- Day  instead of 90-Daynorm.  This will be clarified once the position is crystalised as per international norm.However, to ensure smooth transition, sufficient time up to 2004 is given for banks tomake appropriate provisions.  This is a forward looking measure, and a change tomeet global standards.  Similarly, changes have been proposed in the measurement ofcapital for exposure purposes and in the level of exposure limit itself.  These changeswill also be applicable from a future date.In the recent past, policy statements emphasised change in the role of RBIfrom being a micro regulator to concentrate on macro aspects.  While that process ofchanging the role is almost complete, the current statement emphasises changing thefunctions of RBI.  It sets the agenda for divesting itself of the functions as debtmanager, as owner, and in some ways as regulator say of NBFCs or urbanThere are several areas where progress is reported and further measuresindicated, such as in the areas of technology, regulatory review, credit bureau,international financial standards and codes, legal reforms, debt recovery etc.  PerhapsThe current monetary policy has signalled important reforms which requirechanges in existing legislation or introduction of new laws.  These includeamendments to the Public Debt Act and introduction of Government Securities Bill(to provide flexibility in undertaking transactions in Government securities andfacilitate retailing) amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act (to bring aboutamong other things greater flexibility in monetary policy operations by reducing thestatutory minimum for CRR/SLR, enable separation of debt management functionsetc.); passage of Fiscal Responsibility Bill (to bring reasonable control over fiscalmanagement), amendments to the State Bank of India (SBI) and other Acts governingpublic sector banks, National Housing Bank (NHB), National Bank for Agricultureand  Rural Development (NABARD), and Industrial Development FinanceCorporation (IDFC) Acts (to transfer ownership of these institutions from the RBI tothe Government); a new Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation(DICGC) Act (to  make it consistent with financial sector ); a separateAct for Non-Banking Financial Companies ( ) (to provide enhanced protectionto depositors of ); amendment to Banking Regulation Act (to encompass areas9NBFCsNBFCsliberalisationTasks Ahead for Governmentthere is no need to elaborate these to this gathering.cooperatives and concentrate on monetary management.emerging business cycles.which will virtually make of security laws and regulatory framework of banking), amendment to NegotiableInstruments Act (to bring it in conformity with the Information Technology Act, 2000to bring electronic cheque ,  certificate and other evolving products withinits ambit); enactment of Bill on asset  (to create an enabling environmentfor market for asset ).Apart from legislative changes, an important aspect framework for Urban Cooperative Banks has been proposed.  This would need to bepursued in consultation with the Central and State Governments.Ahead for the Reserve Bank of IndiaFirst, RBI has already forwarded the draft amendments to the various acts,which is under consideration of the Government. However, some further work may beneeded from RBI also.Second, the changes proposed in the financial sector will need follow-actions by RBI.  For instance, the move over to the second and third stages of LAFwould need RBI to have a greater fix on the liquidity in its system. RBI is alreadyformalising a short-term liquidity model, which should provide important inputs to itsdecision making.  This would be all the more critical in the next stage.Third, on the operational side, RBI would need to be prepared to advance thetiming of the auction process under LAF as also be prepared with its systems toconduct discriminatory price auctions under LAF and uniform price auctions withFourth, further progress in reform in the financial markets depends on thecommencement of operations by the Clearing Corporation and maintaining the timeschedule for the Negotiated Dealing System, Real Time Gross Settlement system andcomputerisation of Public Debt Office.

Whilethe total liquidity in the money market would not reduce, the composition betweencollateralised and non- collateralised liquidity would alter resulting in a new set ofdynamics.  Hence, new counter-party limits would need to be put in place.  In fact,with the operationlisation of Clearing Corporation, the liquidity would improve since in the Primary Lending Rate (PLR) norms and moreflexibility in fixed deposit maturity and other terms such as premature withdrawal andinterest on overdue deposits, the competition among banks could intensify, whichwould require banks to be more proactive, improve their infrastructure andCorporates will also have greaterincentive to improve their ratings as better corporates would be able to acquire bankloans at finer rates.Fourth, the move to 90-Day norm for Non Performing Assets ( NPAs) forbanks and 180-Day norm for Financial Institutions (FIs) would require changes in theinterest  rate resets and implicitly alterations in systems and procedures.

No doubt, directed lendingis not the same as subsidised lending.  The current stipulations regarding lending tothe above sectors have evolved incrementally resulting in discrimination betweenforeign and public sector banks; incentive incompatibility due to possibility of makingup for shortfall through NABARD, Small Industries Development Bank of India(SIDBI), etc.; and wide interpretation of directed lending to include investments. It isproposed to prepare a technical paper analysing the current situation, the problemsAt present, current account facility in RBI is extended to banks for the purposeof meeting their statutory obligations, settlement of transactions withRBI/Government and inter-bank transactions.  Besides banks, non-banks likeinsurance companies, mutual funds, primary dealers, National Securities ClearingCorporation Ltd. etc., are also extended current account facility for such purposes assame day settlement as well as use of funds on the same day for call moneytransactions and facilitating development of the government securities market.However, in the context of the recommendations of the Technical Group on phasingout of non-banks from call/notice money market, the setting up of ClearingCorporation and the proposed opening up of membership of INFINET to allinstitutions which are maintaining current account and/or SGL account with RBI, it isfelt that the present policy of current account facility needs a review. Accordingly, aWorking Group has been set up by the RBI to examine the issues of rationalisation ofcurrent account facility provided by the RBI.  The Group, inter alia , would examinethe objectives and practices in regard to extension of current account facility, studyRecognising the importance of clear-cut legal framework to govern paymentssystem, RBI’s proposals for amendment to Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 includeempowerment of the Bank with appropriate regulatory and supervisory powers inrespect of payments and settlement system in the country.  The amendments, onceapproved will provide the necessary legal framework consistent with emergingcomplexities and technological developments in such systems globally.  Morerecently, the Advisory Group on Payment and Settlement System ( Chairman : M.G. Bhide) which examined the existing status of major systemically importantpayment systems in the country has also recognised a number of shortcomings,including lack of a well-founded legal framework and absence of risk managementWithout prejudice to these developments , it is felt necessary to considerseveral operational aspects.  Thus, existing arrangements relating to eligibility normsfor admission of new members/sub-members into the Clearing House, level ofcash/market value of securities to be maintained as collateral with the RBI by themembers to ensure safety of settlement etc., need a thorough review to safeguard theintegrity of payment system.

Technical advances have also resulted in acceleratedpace of innovations and complexities in financial products besides the multi-foldincrease in volumes and turnover. Indian financial system is catching up fast withthese developments in the post-reform period. The regulatory regimes and supervisorysystems in the changing environment face new challenges in safeguarding theintegrity, efficiency, soundness and stability of the financial system.  This calls for astudy of the regulatory and supervisory arrangements.  In India, the regulatory andsupervisory arrangements have been rendered complex in view of the existence ofvarious types of financial intermediaries with differing charters owing their origins toCurrently, institutions that are broadly under the regulatory ambit of ReserveBank fall in the following categories. (a) Public sector banks which are governed bystatutes with close involvement of Government though regulated by RBI. (b) Foreignbanks, which are registered as branches and private banks incorporated underCompanies Act and regulated by RBI. (c)Urban Cooperative banks, both scheduledand non-scheduled, which are under dual regulation of RBI and the StateGovernments/Central Government. (d) Non-banking financial  companiesincorporated under Companies Act which have been recently brought legally withinRBI’s regulatory framework. Housing Finance companies, however, are regulated andsupervised by National Housing Bank.
