*Monetary Policy: An OutlineRespected Vice-Chancellor Professor Simhadri, Professor Bhanoji Rao,Professor K.C. Reddy, and fellow-members of Andhra Pradesh Economic Association.I am thankful to the organisers for inviting me to be the President and deliver thePresidential Address.  There are several reasons for my being keen to be inVisakhapatnam to deliver the Presidential Address. I commenced my career inGovernment of Andhra Pradesh in Visakhapatnam as Assistant Collector UnderTraining over forty years ago - in 1965.  I had the benefit of professional guidancefrom eminent scholars and economists in Andhra University such as ProfessorsSarveswara Rao garu, D.V. Ramana garu, G. Parthasarathy garu, K.V. Ramana garuand S. Chandrasekhar garu. Subsequently, I acquired many friends with strong linkshere, such as Professors Krishnamurthy garu and R. Radhakrishna garu.  ProfessorBhanoji Rao garu has been a valued friend, whether he was in the World Bank withme, or in Singapore or in the Administrative Staff College in Hyderabad.  ProfessorK.C. Reddy garu worked alongside me when I was the Secretary in Planning andFinance Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.  With all theseattractions, I regret to say that I am not able to be physically present inVisakhapatnam to deliver the Presidential Address at the 23rd Annual Conference dueto unavoidable official commitments.The Andhra Pradesh Economic Association has been one of the pioneeringefforts in our country in organising a sub-national level professional body ofeconomists.  I have no doubt that it is a wise initiative and needs to be carried forward.As the economic reform in India progresses, the relative balance in public policy wouldshift in favour of the states relative to the centre.  The important areas earmarked forthe centre, such as external sector and financial sector, tend to be subjected toglobalisation while in areas such as education, health, sanitation, roads, water works,power, etc. which are localized in nature, states could have a greater role.  Greatermarketisation of economies and private capital flows tend to look for conducivegovernance at the state-level where economic activities are located. Hence, the stategovernments are well advised to take dynamic policy-initiatives and it is in thisbackground that the economists engaged at the state level have to play a crucial rolein the reform-process.  In fact, there is some evidence of a positive link between                                                                * Presidential Address by Dr. Y.V.

Interestingly, moststates which have done well in terms of investment and growth also have researchinstitutes of repute in the area of social and economic sciences.Needless to say that, in this background, I am delighted to deliver thePresidential Address at the Annual Conference of Andhra Pradesh EconomicAssociation.  In a conference of economists, it is appropriate to go by the principle ofcomparative advantage, and accordingly I decided to focus my comments on the coreof my current professional as well as official preoccupation and talk on the monetarypolicy.In its conduct of monetary policy, the central bank responds to the evolvingeconomic activity within an articulated monetary policy framework. This frameworkwould normally have three basic constituents, viz.,• the objectives of monetary policy;• the analytics of monetary policy focusing on the transmissionmechanism; and• the operating procedure focusing on operating targets and instruments.For convenience, each of these issues has been dealt with separately and inthis light, the Indian experience has been touched upon briefly.ObjectivesTraditionally, central banks have pursued the twin objectives of price stabilityand growth. Central banks have to keep in view the considerations of exchange ratestability and financial stability also in pursuing the basic objectives. Can we achievethese objectives all at a time?  As in most aspects of life, the objectives of monetarypolicy are interrelated, and there are trade-offs as well. Illustratively, economists oftentalk of the Phillips curve according to which there is a short-run negative relationbetween inflation and unemployment. While there are various viewpoints on Phillipscurve, in a world where the Phillips curve is valid, a central bank can reduce inflationonly at the cost of having more unemployment. Similar trade-offs exist among otherobjectives as well.Faced with multiple objectives that are equally desirable, there remains theproblem of assigning to each policy instrument the most appropriate objective.Accordingly, there is a broad consensus, both in academic and policy circles, that3monetary policy is useful as an instrument to achieving the goal of price stability.The adoption of price stability as the only objective of monetary policy is,however, by no means universal. While a number of prominent central banks includingthe European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan have adopted pricestability as the single objective of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve of the UScontinues to pursue multiple objectives of monetary policy, viz., a) maximumemployment, b) stable prices, and c) moderate long-term interest rates. Central banksin several developing countries have placed exchange rate management as anotherimportant policy objective. In recent years, particularly after the financial crises of1990s, the concern for financial stability is an integral part of the central bank’sactivism.Analytics of Monetary PolicyThe process through which changes in the monetary policy get transmitted tothe ultimate objectives like inflation or growth has come to be known as “monetarytransmission mechanism”. Interestingly, economists often refer to the channels of“monetary transmission” as a black box – implying that we know that monetary policydoes influence output and inflation but we do not know for certain how precisely itdoes so. Nevertheless, in the literature, a number of transmission channels have beenidentified: (a) the quantum channel (e.g., relating to money supply and credit); (b) theinterest rate channel; (c) the exchange rate channel; and (d) the asset price channel.How these channels function in a given economy depends on the stage ofdevelopment of the economy and its underlying financial structure. Illustratively, in anopen economy one would expect the exchange rate channel to be important; similarly,in an economy where banks are the major source of finance (as against the capitalmarket), credit channel seems to be a major conduit for monetary transmission.Besides, it needs to be noted that these channels are not mutually exclusive – in fact,there could be considerable feedbacks and interactions among them.Central banks may not be in a position to directly achieve their ultimateobjectives and hence, monetary policy is often formulated in terms of an intermediatetarget. For example, in a monetary targeting framework, a suitable monetaryaggregate is considered as an intermediate target based on the basic relationshipbetween money, output and prices. Exchange rate as an intermediate target can besuitable for small open economies, setting the exchange rate against a low-inflation4anchor country. This may, however, entail loss of independence in steering domesticinterest rates.In this context, it is necessary to touch upon what is known as the ‘impossibletrinity’, or ‘trilemma’ of monetary policy. This refers to the incompatibility among threepolicy choices, viz., (a) fixed exchange rate, (b) open capital account, and (c)independent monetary policy. The basic message of the ‘trilemma’ is that a centralbank can achieve any two of the above-mentioned parameters, but not all the three.Illustratively, if a country wants to have fixed exchange rate and independentmonetary policy then it is difficult to maintain an open capital account.Another important issue in monetary policy is the extent of transparency.Central bankers all over the world are not exactly known for clarity in their language.Nevertheless, the rational expectations school in macroeconomics holds that no policycan be successful over a period by “fooling” the economic agents. In this context, onemay differentiate between genuine uncertainties about the future vis-à-vis notrevealing the expected outcome of the policy.  In fact, since the 1990s, there has beena preference all over the world to improve the transparency of monetary policy.In the context of improving transparency, the recent trend has been towardsdirect inflation targeting. Adoption of explicit inflation targeting as the final goal ofmonetary policy involves the preparation of an inflation forecast, which, in a way,serves the purpose of both an intermediate target and final objective. The pre-requisites for inflation targeting include a considerable degree of operationalautonomy or independence for central bank, flexible exchange rate conditions, well-developed financial markets and absence of fiscal dominance.In view of the growing complexities of macroeconomic management, severalcentral banks including the European Central Bank have placed reliance on a broadset of economic and leading indicators rather than focusing exclusively on anintermediate target or a direct inflation target. The Federal Reserve has traditionallybeen following a more broad based approach to the conduct of monetary policy in theUS.Operating Procedures: Instruments and TargetsOperating procedures refer to the day-to-day implementation of monetarypolicy by central banks through various instruments. These instruments can be5broadly classified into direct and indirect instruments. Typically, direct instrumentsinclude required cash and/ or liquidity reserve ratios, directed credit and administeredinterest rates. Cash reserve ratio (CRR) determines the level of reserves (central bankmoney or cash) banks need to hold against their liabilities. Similarly, liquidity reserveratio requires banks to maintain a part of their liabilities in the form of liquid assets(e.g., government securities). Credit and interest rate directives take the form ofprescribed targets for allocation of credit to preferred sectors/industries andprescription of deposit and lending rates.The indirect instruments generally operate through price channel which coverrepurchase (repos) and outright transactions in securities (open market operations),standing facilities (refinance) and market-based discount window.  For example, if thecentral bank desires to inject liquidity for a short period, it could do so by providingfunds to the banks in exchange of securities at a desired interest rate, reversing thetransaction at a pre-determined time. Similarly, if the central bank desires to influenceliquidity on an enduring basis, it could resort to open market operations (OMO),involving outright purchase (or sale) of securities.While OMO including repo transactions operate at the discretion of the centralbank, standing facilities provide limited liquidity which could be accessed by theeligible market participants (generally banks) at their discretion. Market-baseddiscount window makes available reserves either through direct lending or throughrediscounting or purchase of financial assets held by banks.In practice, the choice between direct and indirect instruments is not easy.While direct instruments are effective, they are considered inefficient in terms of theirimpact on the financial market. On the other hand, the use and efficacy of indirectinstruments depends on the extent of development of the supporting financial marketsand institutions. These instruments are usually directed at attaining a prescribed valueof the operating target. Central banks typically adopt either (a) bank reserves or (b) avery short-term interest rate (usually the overnight inter-bank rate) as the operatingtarget.The optimal choice between price and quantity targets would depend on thesources of disturbances in the goods and money markets. In reality, it often becomesdifficult to trace out the sources of instability. Hence, monetary policy is implementedby fixing, at least over some short time interval, the value of an operating target. In a6single-period context, the choice of the level of the target amounts to setting a rule formonetary policy. However, in a dynamic context, their connection is lessstraightforward.  Indeed, a deviation from a target could occur, either intended orunintended, which may impart an inflationary bias when monetary policy is conductedwith discretion. In order to address such problems of dynamic inconsistency, rule-based solutions are emphasized in literature, e.g., monetary rule (changes in moneysupply at a pre-determined rate) and Taylor-type rule (changes in interest rate basedon deviation of growth and inflation from their potential/desired levels). While a rule-based system imparts transparency, providing certainty about future policy response,it becomes ineffective in its response to unanticipated shocks given its inflexibility. Inpractice, therefore, central banks follow an approach of what has been best describedas constrained discretion.The operating procedures of monetary policy of most central banks havelargely converged to one of the following three variants: (i) estimate the demand forbank reserves and then carry out open market operations to target short-term interestrates; (ii) estimate market liquidity and carry out open market operations to target thebank reserves, while allowing interest rates to adjust; and (iii) modulate monetaryconditions in terms of both the quantum and price of liquidity, through a mix of openmarket operations, standing facilities and minimum reserve requirement and changesin the policy rate with the objective of containing overnight market interest rate within anarrow corridor of interest rate targets.Indian SpecificsIn this backdrop, let me now turn to the conduct of monetary policy in India.What has been the objective of Indian monetary policy? The preamble to theReserve Bank of India Act, 1934 sets out the objectives of the Bank as “to regulate theissue of Bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetarystability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the countryto its advantage”. Although there is no explicit mandate for price stability, as is thecurrent trend in many countries, the objectives of monetary policy in India haveevolved as those of maintaining price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit tothe productive sectors of the economy. In essence, monetary policy aims to maintaina judicious balance between price stability and economic growth. The relativeemphasis between price stability and economic growth is governed by the prevailing7circumstances in a particular time and is spelt out from time to time in the policyannouncements of the Reserve Bank.Of late, considerations of financial stability have assumed greater importance inview of increasing openness of the Indian economy and financial reforms. In theIndian context, financial stability could be interpreted to embrace three aspects, viz.,(a) ensuring uninterrupted financial transactions, (b) maintenance of a level ofconfidence in the financial system amongst all the participants and stakeholders, and(c) absence of excess volatility that unduly and adversely affects real economicactivity. It is the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to ensure all these aspects offinancial stability.As far as the conduct of monetary policy is concerned, it may be noted thatmonetary policy in India used to be conducted till 1997-98 with broad money (M ) as3an intermediate target. The aim was to regulate money supply consistent with twoparameters, viz., (a) the expected growth in real income, and (b) a projected level ofinflation. On the basis of estimates of these two crucial parameters, the targetedmonetary expansion could be set.  In practice, the monetary targeting framework wasused in a flexible manner with feedback from developments in the real sector.However, questions were raised about the appropriateness of such a framework withthe changing inter-relationship between money, output and prices in the wake offinancial sector reforms and opening up of the economy. The Working Group onMoney Supply (1998) sought to address some of these issues. The most significantobservation of the Group was regarding the changing nature of transmissionmechanism as it highlighted that the interest rate channel was gaining in importance.In line with this thinking, since 1998-99, the Reserve Bank has  switched overto a multiple indicator approach. As per this approach, interest rates or rates of returnin different markets (money, capital and government securities markets), along withdata such as on currency, credit extended by banks and financial institutions, fiscalposition, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinancing andtransactions in foreign exchange available on high-frequency basis, are juxtaposedwith output for drawing policy perspectives.What is the operating procedure of monetary policy in India? In the currentmonetary policy framework, with growing inter-linkages in the financial market,reliance on direct instruments has been reduced and liquidity management in the8system is carried out through OMO in the form of outright purchases/sales ofgovernment securities and daily reverse repo and repo operations under LiquidityAdjustment Facility (LAF). The LAF has enabled the Reserve Bank to modulate short-term liquidity under varied financial market conditions, including large capital inflowsfrom abroad. In addition, it has enabled the Reserve Bank to set a corridor for theshort-term interest rates consistent with the policy objectives. This has also facilitatedbringing down the CRR of banks without engendering liquidity pressure. Theseoperations are supplemented by access to the Reserve Bank’s standing facilities. Inthis new operating environment, changes in reverse repo and/or the Bank Rate haveemerged as interest rate signals.There is no explicit interest rate target envisaged in India. Nevertheless, a greatdeal of reliance has been placed in recent years on interest rates and exchange ratesin the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy. In the context of increasing openness ofthe economy and a market-determined exchange rate, the large capital inflowswitnessed in recent years have posed major challenges to the conduct of monetaryand exchange rate management. A critical issue in this regard is a view on whetherthe capital flows are temporary or permanent in nature.  The recent episode of largecapital flows prompted a debate in India on the need for exchange rate adjustment. Ina scenario of uncertainty facing the monetary authorities in determining temporary orpermanent nature of inflows, it is prudent to presume that such flows are temporary tillthey are firmly established to be of permanent nature. The liquidity impact of large inflows was managed till the year 2003-04, largelythrough the day-to-day LAF and OMO. In the process, the stock of governmentsecurities available with the Reserve Bank declined progressively and the burden ofsterilization increasingly fell on LAF operations. In order to address these issues, theReserve Bank signed in March 2004, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with theGovernment of India for issuance of Treasury Bills and dated government securitiesunder the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS). The intention of MSS is essentially todifferentiate the liquidity absorption of a more enduring nature by way of sterilisationfrom the day-to-day normal liquidity management operations. The ceiling on theoutstanding obligations of the Government under MSS has been initially indicated butis subject to revision through mutual consultation. The issuances under MSS arematched by an equivalent cash balance held by the Government in a separateidentifiable cash account maintained and operated by the Reserve Bank. The9operationalisation of MSS to absorb liquidity of more enduring nature has considerablyreduced the burden of sterilisation on the LAF window.In its monetary operations, the Reserve Bank uses multiple instruments toensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in the system so that all legitimaterequirements of credit are met, consistent with the objective of price stability. Towardsthis end, the Bank pursues a policy of active management of liquidity through OMOincluding LAF, MSS and CRR, and using the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly,as and when the situation warrants.Way AheadConduct of monetary policy is complex. It has not only to be forward looking butalso to grapple with uncertain future. Additional complexities arise in the case of anemerging market like India, which is transiting from a relatively closed to aprogressively open economy.  In an environment of increasing capital flows, narrowingcross-border interest rate differentials and surplus liquidity conditions, exchange ratemovement tends to have linkages with interest rate movements. The challenge of amonetary authority is to balance the various choices into a coherent whole and toformulate a policy as an art of the possible.Let me now conclude by wishing this Conference all success.
