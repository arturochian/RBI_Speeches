2Migration from cash to electronic payments 
• The Payment Systems Vision Document 2012-15 of the Reserve Bank
portrays a renewed commitment towards provision of safe, efficient,
accessible, inclusive, interoperable and authorised payment and
settlement systems in the country.
• The Vision Document recognises the challenges that exist in the form
of predominance of cash payments, lack of penetration of modern
electronic payment systems in rural and semi-urban areas, challenges
to financial inclusion and migration of government payments to
electronic modes as well as other infrastructural issues
Focus on migration in the retail segment (individuals), businesses and

Value in BnRecent trends in e-payments..3
• Retail electronic segment has registered a growth of 59.68% in
volume and 50.11% in value
– NEFT volumes and values grew by 67.71% and 50.87%,
respectively, during the year
• Debit card usage has registered a growth rate of 28.35% against the
growth rate of credit card at 25.24 %.
7Mobile Banking
• Despite a very high mobile density in the country, the potential for
leveraging on this technology for offering financial services is largely
yet untapped.
– over 900 million mobile users in the country but only 40 million
mobile banking customers
• Underscores the need for active collaboration between banks and
telcos
– irrespective of the channel through which such services are
provided, such as, SMS, applications, USSD
• Regulatory measures
– TRAI has set the ceiling tariff for USSD-based mobile banking services
– RBI has taken steps to provide accessible, convenient as well as cost effective

(Figures in bracket is %age changes over previous year)
9Role of banks & telcos in 
expanding mobile banking outreach
• Need to create more public awareness through a sustained centrally
orchestrated common marketing campaign for popularizing USSD
• Banks need to see mobile banking channel as a cost saving avenue
(reduction of cash handling charges) rather than revenue generation
vertical
• Incentivising consumers for using mobile banking (?)
• Banks and telcos to work together for addressing customer
grievances
10Role of banks & telcos in 
expanding mobile banking outreach
• Reserve Bank had set up a Technical Committee on Mobile Banking
(Chairman: B. Sambamurthy) to
– study the challenges faced by the banks in providing mobile
banking to customers
– examine the options/alternatives including the feasibility of using
encrypted SMS-based funds transfer
• Two technical groups have also been constituted to
– set standards for on-boarding mobile banking customers
– set standards for industry agreements between banks and MNOs
for handling customer grievances
• The National Unified USSD Platform (NUUP) of the NPCI offers an
interoperable USSD-based mobile banking service
– this holds great opportunity for expanding the mobile banking
11
outreach in the countryBharat Bill Payment System (BBPS)
• The BBPS is proposed to be a pan-India system for running the bills
payment system in the country
– the entire system operating on a single brand image so as to enjoin the
confidence and trust of the customers.
• The BBPS is aimed to provide
– convenience of ‘anytime anywhere’ bill payment
– an interoperable bill payments for millions of customers in the country
– replace the segmented bill payments taking place in silos at present
• The proposed system will function as a tiered structure with a single
brand image under the standards (technical and operational) set by
the centralized unit.
– standards will also address the need for uniformity in handling customer
grievances, settlement procedures and timelines, etc.
• The operating units will link up the billers and the collection agents
and provide the interoperability which is lacking today
12Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS)
• The TReDS aims at addressing concerns related to efficient financing
options for the MSME segment
– eligible invoices and bills of MSMEs will be placed on the system
for acceptance by the buyers
– financed by financiers so as to ensure financing
• The TReDS will 
– centrally on-board the various stakeholders – buyers, sellers and 
financiers
– handle KYC and documentation related matters
– ensure that master agreements are in place
– standardize turnaround time for various activities involved in 
stages from uploading of invoices / bills to final payments on due 
dates
13Role of banks in BBPS & TReDS
• Many banks are providing bill payment services and payment
gateway services especially in card payments
– network effect and positive impact with these banks joining the BBPS
• Other banks will be able to leverage on the inter-operable platform
of BBPS and offer enhanced services and bill payment options to
their clientele
• Banks can also use their vast BC and agent network for this task
• Banks have to work for the success of the TReDS through active
involvement and engagement
• Banks would be expected to support setting up of desirable
standards for all operational processes and procedure so as to derive
synergy for all participants.
The impact of this system for the hygiene in the eco-system will be
positive in the medium and long term for the MSME sector which is a
key thrust area of banks’ business.
14Security vs Convenience
• Recent reiteration of an existing policy related to security and risk
mitigation in card transactions has led to some debates
– that Reserve Bank has stifled innovation!
• Policy measures of RBI are proactive with focus on safety concerns
• mandating online alerts for card transactions
– now drawing attention of policy makers of other countries
• mandating PIN entry for every transaction at ATM
• mandating the need for additional factor of authentication for
card transactions
– put in place in 2009
• strengthening the security of internet banking transactions
including beneficiary management, velocity checks, etc.
• migration from magstrip to CHIP and PIN cards
• strengthening the security of card processing infrastructure
• reducing the turnaround time for handling customer grievances
15Security vs Convenience .. 2
Changing consumer behavior being a challenge, the trade-off between
security and convenience often is not an easy one, given the tenuous
trust placed on electronic payments in this country
• Reserve Bank is in favour of innovation and innovative payments but
it balances the convenience factor with suitable safeguards for
protecting or limiting customer liability
– Focus is on Availability, Affordability & Acceptability yet with an
Assurance about Safety & Security
16Jan Dhan Yojana: Challenges & Opportunities 
• Opportunities for expanding business by leveraging these accounts
– small customers big markets
• Challenges of technological & operational issues in handling millions of
accounts
– Ability of banks to issue cards (and related processes for meeting existing
mandates on security and safety) to millions of customers
– Issues relating to de-duplication
– The impact on the interoperable ATM networks
– Enabling micro-ATMs to accept magstripe cards as per the standards laid down
by the IBA
– The need for expansion of POS networks
– Scalability of banks’ hardware and software systems
– Augmenting human resources at banks to deal with customers’ issues and
grievances
– Upgrading the capacity & capabilities of the BCs
Imperative to ensure not only existing requirements are met but also ensure
17
that whatever systems are put in place are “future-ready”.Concluding thoughts: Changing Eco-system
• Need for a re-orientation in thinking
– How investment in technology is viewed?
• revenue generation or cost savings
• Balancing between the goals of profit versus growth
• Harnessing ICT for sustainable financial inclusion
• To protect the market share and profitability
– Banks need to reposition themselves as niche players based on inherent
strengths
• Changing consumer behavior with respect to where and how he shops for financial
services products: “hyper-connectivity”
• Proliferation of alternatives to traditional financial services organization – for
banking, banks may not be needed
(ala Bank 3.0: Why Banking is no longer somewhere you go, but something you do by Brett King)
• Rise of powerful social media platforms
– Banks should leverage on the increasing popularity of interactive social
platforms for effective engagement with their customers
18Concluding thoughts : New Possibilities
• Leveraging social and mobile capabilities as well as cloud computing
and software-as-a-service (SAS) would be the key for traditional
banks to drive more customer interactions at a lower unit cost
• Need for technology-enabled transformation to improve revenue
generation, operational efficiency and risk management
• With lower cost-to-serve capabilities coupled with technology-driven
transformation of operating and distribution models, banks can now
reach new customers in new markets
• Mining of Big Data can open up new revenue verticals for the banks
and help better risk measurement alongwith effective identification
of sales or cost-saving opportunities.
• By tapping social networks, banks can access customers’ social
profiles, and thereby deepen their insights into individual customer
behavior
19Concluding thoughts: Partners in Digital India Plan 
• India is in the cusp of a digital revolution – it may be ambitious but
definitely achievable
• Digital India Plan of the new Government
– Connecting all the Gram Panchayats (GPs) through broadband network
by 2019 with estimated expenditure of more than` 1 trillion
– Three key pillars
• Digital infrastructure
– Providing digital identities to people
– Universal access to bank accounts & phones across the country
– Safe and secure cyber space
• Governance and services on demand
– On real-time and accessible platform
– Financial transactions to be electronic & cashless
• Digital empowerment
– All documents and certificates available on cloud
• Renewed focus on the National Digital Literacy Mission
