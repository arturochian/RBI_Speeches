    The Role of Fiscal and Monetary  Policies in Sustaining Growth   with Stability in India     by         Rakesh Mohan  Deputy Governor  Reserve Bank of India    at   Sixth Asian Economic Policy  Review Conference  Tokyo  April 19,  2008        The Role of Fiscal and Monetary Policies   in Sustaining Growth with Stability in India     Rakesh Mohan*    The performance of the Indian economy in recent years has attracted  increasing international interest. This conference is therefore a timely one to take  stock of what has happened and to also deepen our understanding of the policies  and processes that have led to the current trends.  This paper focuses on the  role of fiscal and monetary policies in the evolution of the Indian economy over  the years, with particular attention being given to the reforms undertaken in these  policies since the early 1990s.    Macroeconomic Overview   An interesting feature of the record of economic growth in India is that it  has experienced a sustained slow acceleration in growth since independence.  Growth has been accelerating gradually since the 1950s, except for an  1 interregnum between 1965 and 1980 (Table 1). Thus, the current observed  acceleration in growth has to be seen in the context of this long record of  consistent growth, which has been accompanied by a relatively continuous  increase in savings and investment rates over the years. What is remarkable in  recent years is the very substantial steep increase that has taken place in this  decade in the rates of savings and investment.   Comprehensive economic reforms have been undertaken on a  continuous basis since the crisis year of 1991-92, which have presumably  contributed to the acceleration in growth that is now being experienced. There  was, however, some slowdown of the growth process in the latter half of the  1990s, which coincided with the onset of the East Asian financial crisis.  Since  2003-04, there has been a distinct strengthening of the growth momentum with                                                    ?

Gross Domestic Capital Formation; GDS: Gross Domestic Savings; ICOR: Incremental Capital Output  Ratio; SCB: Scheduled Commercial Banks.    The sustained acceleration in real GDP growth of the Indian economy has  been associated with a secular up trend in domestic savings and investment over  the decades.  Gross domestic saving has moved up from an average of 9.6  percent of GDP during the 1950s to almost 35 per cent of GDP in 2006-07.   Similarly, the domestic investment rate has increased continuously from 10.8 per  cent in 1950s to close to 36 per cent by 2006-07.  The remarkable feature of  these trends in savings and investment rates is that Indian economic growth has  been financed predominantly by domestic savings.  The recourse to foreign  savings has been modest.  However, the two decades of 1960s and 1980s, when  the current account deficit had reached or exceeded around 2 per cent of GDP,  were followed by significant balance of payment difficulties and economic crises.     3     A significant feature of the Indian growth record has been that inflation  has been relatively moderate throughout. Average inflation, measured by the  wholesale price index, was low at 1.2 per cent during the 1950s, but then  increased to 6.4 per cent during the 1960s, 9.0 per cent in the 1970s, 8.0 per  cent in the 1980s, and close to 10.0 per cent during the first half of the 1990s.  Subsequently, in this decade, inflation has averaged close to 5.0 per cent (until  the current upsurge in inflation in 2008).  The current regime of low and stable  inflation appears to have reduced and stabilized inflation expectations and the  threshold level of inflation tolerance in the economy has come down significantly.     The economic crisis of 1991 was essentially a balance of payments crisis.  A key feature of the success of Indias reform process since the early 1990s is  the substantial strengthening of Indias external sector. The current account  deficit has been maintained at a modest level of around 1 per cent of GDP  though it also experienced a marginal surplus during 2001-02 to 2003-04.  The  value of exports and imports, in US dollar terms, more than tripled by 2007-08  relative to 2000-01.  India has emerged as an increasingly open economy with  the value of trade in goods and services increasing from 29.2 per cent of GDP in  2000-01 to 46.5 per cent in 2007-08.  On account of strong capital flows, there  have been accretions to foreign exchange reserves, which at US $ 312 billion on  June 30, 2008 are much higher than the external debt (US $ 221 billion at end- June 2008).   The sustained reform process in the macro economy has been  accompanied by gradual reforms in the financial sector through the whole period  since the early 1990s. The efficient allocation of resources is helped greatly if  interest rates are market determined and reflect the opportunity cost of money  appropriately. The earlier period had been characterised by a plethora of  administered interest rates, a system of credit allocation, and automatic  monetisation of fiscal deficits. The process of interest rate deregulation was  carried out gradually, and banks were given increasing autonomy in decision  making along with the cessation of credit allocation. The monetisation of fiscal  deficits was first reduced and then eliminated, with government financing being  done increasingly through debt auctions entailing the discovery of risk free  interest rates in the economy.    4   Current account convertibility was introduced in the early 1990s  enabling the adoption of a market-determined exchange rate. The capital  account has also been liberalised gradually, but is not fully open, entailing  intervention in the forex market by the Reserve Bank to contain excess volatility.  The financial sector reforms, designed to improve cost efficiency through price  signals have, in turn, facilitated the conduct of monetary policy through indirect  market-based instruments and improved fiscal-monetary coordination.   On the fiscal side, this process was further strengthened through the  implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM)  Act, 2003, under which the Central Government was mandated to eliminate the  revenue deficit and reduce its fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2008-09 and  the Reserve Bank was prohibited from participating in the primary government  securities market from April 2006.   Whereas the main objective of financial sector reforms has been the  enhancement of efficiency of the financial system, a concomitant goal was also  to impart stability in a new market oriented environment.   Development of  financial markets has therefore been a key component of this process. On the  whole, the financial sector reforms have led to better price discovery in both  interest rates and exchange rates, thereby contributing to overall efficiency in  financial intermediation.  The increase in financial deepening in recent years and  the attainment of overall efficiency in the use of resources suggest that financial  intermediation in India has been relatively efficient.    Significant improvement in performance of the domestic banking sector  has been witnessed over the past decade or so.  Gradual introduction of best  international practices and norms, refinements in the supervisory practices,  tightening of risk weights/provisioning norms in regard to sectors witnessing high  credit growth, greater market discipline brought about by raising of capital from  the capital markets and listing on the stock exchanges, interest rate deregulation,  and scaling down of statutory pre-emptions are amongst the key factors that  have led to better performance of the public sector banks. Concomitantly, greater  competition has been induced in the domestic banking sector by successful  introduction of new generation private sector banks. The measured performance  of the public sector banks is now converging towards that of the best private  sector banks in terms of the usual parameters.  Despite strong growth in balance  sheets of the new banks, the banking system has exhibited remarkable stability.   5   Although there have been a few instances of weaknesses in a few new  private sector banks, pre-emptive measures in the form of the mergers of such  banks with stronger banks, or infusion of new capital and change in ownership,  on a voluntary or involuntary basis, have contributed to the strength of the  domestic banking system, engendered confidence in the depositors and enabled  maintenance of overall financial stability. Overall, the Indian banking sector  exhibits a high degree of financial health.  Notwithstanding the substantial  improvement, the domestic banking system will need to be further strengthened  to face greater external competition and introduction of financial innovations and  fuller capital account convertibility (Mohan, 2007).  The coordination of fiscal and monetary policies has been crucial in  sequencing of the economic reform process carried out since the early 1990s.   While both the policies may have independent objectives, they complement each  other: there has had to be a continuous process of fiscal monetary cooperation.     Fiscal Policy in India    Fiscal Regimes over the Years  A Snapshot     The objective of economic policy during the 1950s and 1960s was mainly  to increase the growth rate of the economy through increasing public investment  and overall economic planning. Taxation was used as an instrument for reducing  private consumption and investment and for transferring resources to the  Government to enable it to undertake large-scale public investment in an effort to  spur economic growth. Furthermore, taxation policy was geared towards  achieving the economic objectives of promoting employment through grant of tax  incentives to new investment; reducing inequality through progressive taxes on  income and wealth; reducing pressure on balance of payments through increase  of import duties; and stabilising prices through tax rebate in excise duties on  consumption goods.   Fiscal policy during the 1970s consciously focused on achieving greater  equity and social justice and both taxation and expenditure policies were  employed towards this end. Accordingly, income tax rates were raised to very  high levels, with the maximum marginal rate of income tax moving up to 97 per  cent and, together with the incidence of wealth tax, it even crossed 100 per cent.   Over the years, in addition to the commitment towards a large volume of  developmental expenditure, the Governments expenditure widened to include    6   rising subsidies. Large interest payments on growing debt and  downward rigidity in prices further contributed to increased current expenditure.   Current revenues, on the other hand, were less buoyant leading to the  emergence of sizeable revenue deficits in the Central government budget from  1979-80 onwards, complicating the task of monetary policy.  During the 1980s, Indian public finances were in a state of disarray with  the fiscal pattern destabilising the relationship between the economy and the  budget.  This resulted in persistently large deficits which were seemingly  intractable.  Considerable fiscal deterioration took place during the 1980s and  eventually became unsustainable, though the growth rate did rise significantly  with enhancement in public investment in infrastructure. During this phase,  expenditure of the Government was seen as an instrument having a bearing  upon aggregate demand, resource allocation and income distribution. The  Government sought to reduce its deficit through tax increases. Customs duties  were hiked to augment revenue and to protect domestic industry. There was a  structural change in the government budgets during the 1980s. The emergence  of revenue deficit in 1979-80 in the Centre's Budget continued to enlarge during  the 1980s, raising concerns over the rising public debt and interest payments and  the consequent constraint on the availability of resources for meeting  developmental needs. The 1980s witnessed a steady increase in market  borrowings along with an increase in Reserve Bank's support to such borrowing,  thus compromising monetary policy.   Fiscal dominance in the system meant that, alongside primary financing  by the Reserve Bank in the form of higher monetised deficits, the banking  system was also subjected to statutory preemptions through a phased increase  in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR): at its peak, 38.5 per cent of banks net  demand and time liabilities had to be invested compulsorily in government and  other approved securities. The monetary policy imperative was that, in order to  retain monetary control, the Reserve Bank had to progressively increase the  cash reserve requirements (CRR) on banks, preempting further the use of  banking resources. Consequently, although monetary expansion was low by the  standards of several Latin American countries, it remained high during the 1970s  and 1980s with its consequent impact on inflation, which was also fuelled by the  global oil shocks in the 1970s (Table 2).     7   Table 2:  Money Supply Growth - A Cross-Country Survey  (Per cent)  Country 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000-06  1 2 3 4 5 6  Developed Economies  Australia 3.9 11.1 9.9 11.3 13.3  Canada 5.2 9.7 12.6 6.9 7.9  France - - - - -  Germany 7.8 9.5 6.2 9.9 -  Japan 16.9 16.3 4.9 8.5 7.6  New Zealand 2.1 12.2 15.1 5.9 12.2  Switzerland 7.1 7.8 3.0 6.9 5.6  US 4.3 7.0 6.9 4.1 2.4  UK 3.1 12.5 14.8 10.4 10.8  Developing Economies  Argentina 26.7 117.7 657.7 130.0 24.1  Brazil 51.0 40.7 312.6 803.8 16.0  Egypt 6.9 19.5 14.1 10.3 15.0  India 9.1 20.3 15.5 15.7 15.4  Indonesia - 34.3 20.7 19.3 17.8  Korea 28.9 29.6 16.4 12.7 10.0  Malaysia 6.1 16.4 10.1 15.2 9.9  Mexico 11.6 22.7 57.1 34.4 13.6  Philippines 9.8 16.9 16.1 17.4 10.4  Singapore 9.4 15.7 9.3 8.7 7.8  South Africa 11.4 11.1 22.7 19.9 12.9  Thailand 7.4 12.9 10.7 13.3 6.7  Source: International Financial Statistics online, IMF.       Besides the regular instruments of monetary policy such as CRR and  Bank Rate, the Reserve Bank also took recourse to selective credit control  measures in order to restrict credit flow to sensitive commodities during the  1970s since inflation was partly thought to be structural. During the 1980s,  however, inflation was largely demand-pull as rising fiscal deficits, which were  financed through greater monetisation, boosted aggregate demand.  Consequently, the monetary impact of greater monetisation was sought to be  neutralised by raising CRR while unbridled credit expansion in the commercial  sector was checked through the imposition of higher SLR. But inflation in the  1980s remained elevated. Thus, the choice of and emphasis on a particular  monetary policy instrument has varied across the decades, particularly, in the  context of inflation emanating from different sources (Bhattacharyya and Ray,  2007). Although inflation (in terms of the CPI) in India was significantly higher in   8   the 1970s and 1980s than in previous periods, it was still substantially lower  than in many Latin American and other developing countries (Table 3).       Fiscal Policy Reforms since the 1990s  The fiscal imbalances of the 1980s spilled over to the external sector  resulting in the macroeconomic crisis of 1991. Another disquieting feature of the  fiscal system was the large size of monetised deficit, which in turn exerted                                Table 3: Consumer Price Inflation               - A Cross-Country Survey  (Per cent) Country 1960s  1970s 1980s 1990s 2000-06  1 2  3 4 5 6  Developed Economies  Australia 2.5  9.8 8.4 2.5 3.3  Canada 2.5  7.4 6.5 2.2 2.3  France 3.9  8.9 7.4 1.9 1.8  Germany 2.4  4.9 2.9 2.3 1.6  Japan 5.4  9.1 2.5 1.2 -0.4  New Zealand 3.2  11.5 12.0 2.0 2.6  Switzerland 3.1  5.0 3.3 2.3 1.0  US 2.3  7.1 5.6 3.0 2.8  UK 3.5  12.6 7.4 3.7 2.6  Developing Economies  Argentina 22.9  132.9 565.7 252.9 8.9  Brazil    354.5 @ 843.3 7.8  Chile 25.1  174.6 21.4 11.8 2.8  Egypt 2.9  7.8 17.4 10.5 5.1  India 6.0   7.5 9.1 9.5 4.2  Indonesia 213.3  16.9 9.6 14.5 9.1  Israel 5.2  32.7 129.7 11.2 1.7  Korea 11.3 * 15.2 8.4 5.7 3.0  Malaysia 0.8  5.5 3.7 3.7 2.0  Mexico 2.7  14.7 69.0 20.4 5.4  Philippines 4.7  14.6 14.2 9.5 5.3  Singapore 1.2 # 5.9 2.8 1.9 0.8  South Africa 2.5  9.7 14.6 9.9 5.1  Thailand 2.2  8.0 5.8 5.0 2.5  Source: Report on Currency and Finance 2003-04, International  Financial Statistics, February 2008 and IFS Yearbook, 2006, IMF.    inflationary pressures. The reforms aimed at augmenting revenues and     removing anomalies in the tax structure through restructuring,  simplification and rationalisation of both direct and indirect taxes. Deterioration of   9   the fiscal situation and increased dissaving of Government administration  by the latter half of the 1990s renewed the urgency for improving public finances  at both Centre and State levels, particularly, in view of the need to benchmark  Indian codes and practices to international standards in the aftermath of its  membership to G-20 group of countries.   The Central Government, through the  enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM)  Legislation in August 2003, set for itself a rule-based fiscal consolidation  framework. Expenditure Reform Commissions set up by the Government also  suggested a host of measures to curb built-in-growth in expenditure and to bring  about structural changes in the composition of expenditure. Some of these  measures have been implemented by the Government (Acharya, 2005; Mohan,  2000).      Fiscal Reforms - Central Government  Revenue Pattern and Tax Reforms  The revenue pattern of the Central Government shows that the gross tax  revenue-GDP ratio, which had fallen to 8.8 per cent during 2000-04 from 10.3 per  cent during 1995-2000, has been on an uptrend in recent years reaching 10.4  per cent during 2004-07 and 12.5 per cent in 2007-08. This has been possible  due to a steady rise in the share of direct taxes, particularly in respect of  corporate income tax. There has been a concomitant decline in the share of  indirect taxes in total revenue accounted for mostly by union excise duties,  notwithstanding the gradual increase in the share of service tax (Table 4).   10     Table 4: Profile of Total Revenue of the Central Government                                                                                                                       (Per cent of GDP) 1990-95 1995-00 2000-04 2004-07 2007-08  Item (Avg.)

(Avg.: Average     RE: Revised Estimates)  Source: Budget Documents of the Union Government, various years.     Systematic and comprehensive efforts to reform the tax system in India  started only after market based economic reforms were initiated in 1991. Direct  tax reforms included rationalisation of tax rates, minimisation of exemptions and  concessions, revamping of tax administration and computerisation. Tax rates in  respect of personal income tax were simplified considerably to just three slabs of  20, 30 and 40 per cent in 1992-93.  The financial assets were excluded from  wealth tax and the marginal rate was reduced to one per cent.  Further reduction  was introduced in 1997-98, when the three slabs were brought down to 10, 20  and 30 per cent.    The corporate income tax has also undergone significant changes. The  distinction between closely held and widely held companies was done away with  and tax rates were unified at 40 per cent in 1993-94.  The corporate tax rate was  brought down to 35 per cent in 1997-98 and the levy of tax on dividends in the  hands of shareholders was eliminated. However, a new dividend distribution tax  was introduced and levied on firms. The corporate income tax rate was further  reduced to 30 per cent in 2005-06. The dividend distribution tax rate has varied   11   been 10 per cent and 20 per cent since its introduction, and is currently at 15  per cent. With a view to bringing the zero-tax companies, which took full  advantage of tax preferences and incentives, into tax net, a minimum alternative  tax (MAT) was introduced in 1997-98.  Under the MAT, in case the total income  of the company, as computed under the Income Tax Act after availing of all  eligible deductions, is less than 30 per cent of the book profit, the total income of  such a company shall be deemed to be 30 per cent of the book profit and shall  be charged to tax accordingly. Certain other direct taxes have been introduced in  recent years, such as the levy of fringe benefit tax on companies, which, in  principle, taxes those fringe benefits that cannot be taxed in the hands of the  employees.  The indirect tax structure has also undergone marked changes during the  last decade or so.  Both domestic excise duties that were levied on manufactured  goods and customs duties on imports had traditionally been characterised by the  existence of high levels and a multiplicity of rates. Both have undergone  considerable simplification and rationalisation.  Besides reduction in the number  of rates, the tax has been progressively reduced. In 1999-2000, almost 11 tax  rates were merged into three, with only a handful of luxury items being subject  to higher rates. These were further merged into a single rate in 2000-01 to be  called a Central VAT (CenVAT), along with three special additional excises (8, 16  and 24 per cent) for a few commodities.  The CenVAT rate of 16 per cent has  now been reduced to 14 per cent.  Custom duties have undergone far reaching reforms.  By 1990-91, the  tariff structure was highly complex varying from 0 to 400 per cent.  Further,  quantitative restrictions covered 90 per cent of total imports.  The reform of  custom duties started in 1991-92 when all duties above 150 per cent were  reduced to this level to be called the peak rate, which was brought down in the  next four years to 50 per cent by 1995-96 and further to 40 per cent in 1997-98,  30 per cent in 2002-03, 25 per cent in 2003-04, 15 per cent in 2005-06 and 10  per cent in 2007-08 for non-agricultural goods.  Quantitative restrictions on  imports have virtually been done away with.  The number of major duty rates was  reduced from 22 in 1990-91 to 4 in 2003-04.  There are some items outside  these four rates, but 90 per cent of the custom duties are collected from items  under the four rates.    12   Whereas manufactured goods have been subject to excise duty,  services had not been subject to a corresponding domestic indirect tax. With the  increasing importance of the service sector in the economy, the service tax was  introduced in 1994-95, initially with a levy of taxes on three services of 5 per cent.  The tax rate was revised to 10 per cent in 2004-05 and further to 12 per cent in  2006-07. The aim is to eventually unify the tax rates on goods and services in the  form of a full scale Value Added Tax (VAT). The list of services subject to tax has  been gradually expanded in succeeding years to include 100 services at present.       Fiscal Reforms: State Governments   At the state level, while individual State Governments appointed  Committees from time to time to reform their tax structure, there was no  systematic attempt to streamline the reform process even after 1991 when  market oriented reforms were introduced.  The pace of tax reforms in the States  accelerated in the latter half of the 1990s when there was increasing pressure on  their budgets and to meet targets set under the central government sponsored  medium term fiscal reform facility. Since the division of tax responsibilities  between the Indian central government and the states is mandated by the  constitution, the central government has no jurisdiction over state level tax  reforms. Thus, the introduction of unified tax reforms at the state level required a  great degree of cooperation between states, on the one hand, and collectively,  with the central Ministry of Finance on the other. A major innovation that was  introduced in 1999-2000 was the formation of an Empowered Committee of  State Finance Ministers under the aegis of the Central Finance Ministry. The  work of this Committee resulted in very significant and coordinated tax reform at  the State level. The main tax resource at the state level is the sales tax: each  state had a multitude of tax rates, and there was no uniformity across states.  Beginning with simplification and rationalisation of sales tax rates since the  beginning of this decade, a uniform Value Added Tax (VAT) has now been  adopted by all the States in place of the existing sales tax.  The Central  Government has played the role of a facilitator for successful implementation of  VAT. For example, in order to induce states to undertake this reform, and to  reduce their fears about a possible reduction in revenue, a compensation formula  was put in place for providing compensation to the States on a graded basis  during 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 for any loss on account of introduction of   13   VAT.  Technical and financial support has also been extended to the States  for VAT computerization, publicity, awareness and other related aspects.  The  initial experience with implementation of VAT has been encouraging with VAT  implementing States/Union Territories (UTs) having exhibited a rise in collection  in VAT during 2005-06 (over sales tax of 2004-05) by 13.8 per cent and further  by 21.0 per cent in 2006-07.       Expenditure Pattern and Policy  Since the very significant fiscal imbalance in the 1980s had also  contributed to the 1991 balance of payments crisis, fiscal stabilisation carried out  in the 1990s included both extensive tax reform as well as expenditure reforms.  The total expenditure of the Central Government has declined from 17.9 per cent  of GDP in 1990-95 to 14.7 per cent in 2004-07 (Table 5).  Both revenue and  capital components of expenditure have declined during this period.  Most  importantly the share of capital expenditure in total expenditure declined sharply  from 25.7 per cent in 1990-98 to 17.0 per cent in 2004-07, though this happened  partly because of the cessation of loans from the central government to states,  which were classified as capital expenditures.  However, the decline in capital  expenditure does suggest some moderation in public investment over the period,  which has contributed to the lower than desirable growth in infrastructure  investment since the mid 1990s.    14     Table 5: Profile of Expenditure of the Central Government  (per cent of GDP) 1990- 2007- Item 95 1995-2000 2000-04 2004-07 08  (Avg.)(Avg.)(Avg.)(Avg.)

It has not been easy to undertake expenditure reforms. Much of  government expenditure is non-discretionary. With increasing fiscal deficits,  interest payments have formed a significant proportion of government  expenditure. It is only recently, with reduction in interest rates, and reduction in  the fiscal deficit, that interest payments of the central government have begun to  reduce. A significant non-discretionary portion of Central Government  expenditure is the transfers it makes to State Governments as mandated by the  constitutionally appointed Finance Commissions that make an award every 5  years. Until recently, the Central Government also acted as an intermediary for  State Government borrowing from the market. Consequent to the  recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission, this practice has now  been stopped since 2005-06 and States now have to borrow directly from the  market. The government wage bill and pension obligations are also non- discretionary, unless the government labour force is reduced. However, the  government has succeeded in arresting the growth in government personnel  since the early 1990s, so the wage bill has been relatively stable (as reflected in   15   Other Non Plan Expenditure in Table 5). Recognising the possible  unsustainable growth in the pension bill over the long term, the government has  now moved to a defined contribution regime for all new civil servants since  January 2004. Most State Governments are also following suit. But this reform  will have a beneficial effect on government expenditure only in the very long  term, since the incumbent civil servants will continue on their defined benefit,  pay-as-you-go, system. Defence expenditures have also been brought down  gradually, but cannot probably be reduced much further (as a proportion of  GDP). Subsidies on food, fertilizer and oil have proved to be difficult to reduce,  despite various attempts at targeting them better. As a proportion of GDP,  however, they are now lower than they were in the early 1990s, though there are  now renewed pressures for higher subsidies because of the recent increases in  the prices of each of these items. Overall, the correction in total central  government expenditure has essentially come from lower interest costs and  reductions in capital expenditure.    Broad View on the Outcome of Fiscal Reforms  Deficit Indicators  The progress in fiscal correction was mixed during the 1990s, both at the  Central and State levels (Chart 1).  While there was some reduction in fiscal  deficit in the first half of the 1990s, progress was reversed in the late 1990s  mainly due to the impact of implementation of the Fifth Pay Commissions  awards. The combined fiscal deficit of Centre and the States reached its peak at  9.9 per cent of GDP in 2001-02.  However, fiscal correction has been continuous  from 2004-05 with both the Centre and most of the States operating under a rule  based fiscal framework.  The combined fiscal deficit reached 5.5 per cent in  2007-08.  Incidentally, the fiscal correction process has been faster for the States  compared with that of the Centre. Their consolidated revenue balance is  estimated to be in surplus during 2007-08 (Table 6).   16         Table 6: Deficit Indicators of Centre, States and Combined finances (Per cent of GDP) 1980- 1985- 1990- 1995- 2000- 85 90 95 00 04 2004-07 2007-08  Item (Avg.)

Apart from the quantitative improvement, a salient feature of the fiscal  consolidation underway has been some qualitative progress, as reflected in the  reduction in the proportion of revenue deficit to gross fiscal deficit.    17   The fiscal deficit of both the Centre and the States is basically  financed by domestic sources up to over 90 per cent of GFD.  Within domestic  sources, market borrowings have emerged as the most important instrument for  the Central Government accounting for about three-fourth of financing with the  rest contributed by others, such as small savings, provident funds and reserve  funds deposits and advances.  This is in contrast to the scenario before 1997-98,  when the fiscal deficit was also financed through monetisation.  This  development has contributed to the overall market determination of interest rates  in the economy, and hence to the relevance and effectiveness of monetary  policy.    Outstanding Liabilities  The high level of fiscal deficits both at the Centre and the States led to  debt accumulation over the period resulting in a rise in the debt to GDP ratio.   The combined debt-GDP ratio of Centre and States was about 81.0 per cent  during 2004-06.  Following the impact of fiscal responsibility legislations at both  the centre and the states, the combined debt-GDP ratio has come done in recent  years to 73.8 per cent in 2007-08 (Table 7). Contingent liabilities in the form of  outstanding guarantees by the Government have also witnessed some decline in  the recent years: the combined outstanding guarantees of the centre and the  States declined from 12.2 per cent of GDP at end-March 2001 to 8.1 per cent by  end-March 2007. It may be added that, under the FRBM Act, the annual increase  in the stock of contingent liabilities of the Central Government is limited to a  ceiling of 0.5 per cent of GDP.

Deficit and Growth    A high level of fiscal deficit impacts the practice of monetary policy and  tends to have a negative impact on real GDP growth through crowding out  effects and/or rise in interest rates in the economy.  Chart 2 presents the  movements of GDP growth and combined GFD-GDP ratio.  The high level of  fiscal deficit between 1997-98 and 2002-03 was associated with relatively low  GDP growth.  The reduction in fiscal deficit since 2003-04 has been associated  with a phase of high GDP growth.  Thus, fiscal correction and consolidation,  which is a major ingredient of macroeconomic stability, provide a conducive  environment for propelling growth of the economy.  Low fiscal deficits also enable  more effective monetary policy.     19        Tax-GDP Ratio  A major drag on public finances was the decline in the gross tax-GDP  ratio of the Central Government from 10.3 per cent in 1991-92 to 9.4 per cent in  1996-97 and further to a low of 8.2 per cent in 2001-02.  The decline in tax-GDP  ratio over this phase could, inter alia, be attributed to the initial effects of the  reduction in tax rates.  As already discussed in the earlier section, as a part of  reform of the taxation system, indirect taxes, excise duties as well as custom  duties, were reduced substantially from their earlier high levels and this impacted  the magnitude of indirect tax collections. Revenue from custom duties as a ratio  of imports witnessed almost a secular decline from the high level of 47.8 per cent  in 1990-91 to 10.0 per cent in 2006-07.  Similarly, revenue from union excise  duties as a ratio to value of industrial output declined from 22.1 per cent to 15.2  per cent over the same period (Table 9).  The distorting impact of high and varied  indirect taxes on overall resource allocation has therefore been reduced  considerably, thereby enabling increased economy wide economic efficiency.  Rationalisation of the direct tax structure also did not lead to any positive impact  on revenue collections until 2001-02.  While compliance response to lower taxes  took some time, lower economic growth also contributed to lack of growth in  direct taxes over this period.  The tax-GDP ratio, however, has moved up  significantly in recent years reflecting beneficial impact of the rationalisation of  the direct tax structure on the revenues.  The tax-GDP ratio for 2007-08 is  estimated higher at 12.5 per cent.  The share of direct tax in total gross tax   20   revenue of Centre crossed 50 per cent in 2006-07.  Improved corporate results  during the last 4-5 years have led to significant rise in collection of corporate  income tax.  Thus, growth provides the base for rise in tax-GDP ratio of the  country.

These data demonstrate the efficacy of the Indian tax reform programme  undertaken since the early 1990s: direct taxes are increasing in importance and  the tax-GDP ratio is rising.  The Indian experience also shows how long it takes  for fiscal reform to be effective, and hence the importance of consistent policy  over a long period.    Fiscal Deficit and Public Sector Savings  The reduction in fiscal deficits has also helped in turning around savings  and investments in recent years. The long-term upward trends in savings and   21   investments have been interspersed with phases of stagnation.  In particular,  during the 1980s, the inability of the Government revenues to keep pace with  growing expenditure resulted in widening of the overall resource gap.  The period  1997-98 to 2002-03 witnessed rising public debt with its adverse impact on public  investment and growth.  Following the reform led fiscal consolidation process, the  combined fiscal deficit of Centre and States declined from 9.9 per cent of GDP in  2001-02 to 6.4 per cent in 2006-07 owing to reduction in revenue deficit relative  to GDP from 7.0 per cent to 2.1 per cent.  As a result, the dissavings of  Government administration declined from ()6.0 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to ( )1.3 per cent in 2006-07, and total public sector savings increased from (-)2.0 per  cent in 2001-02 to 3.2 per cent in 2006-07.  Thus, implementation of rule-based  fiscal reforms has helped in enabling the turnaround in the public sector savings  which in turn has been a key element of the remarkable enhancement in gross  domestic savings from 23.5 per cent in 2001-02 to 34.8 per cent in 2006-07,  along with the substantial increase in private corporate sector savings.  Fiscal policy and monetary policy are essentially two arms of overall  economic management. Both have common objectives i.e., the stabilisation of  output and prices and both belong in the genre of policy instruments that operate  on aggregate demand, adjusting/smoothing it so as to ensure an economy-wide  correspondence with the evolution of aggregate supply, though elements of fiscal  policy, particularly in the levy of indirect taxes, can also have sectoral  components. Thus, it is critical for the formulation and implementation of  monetary and fiscal policies to be interactive and complementary so as to  maximise public policy's contribution to enhancing social welfare. In essence, this  is the philosophical rationale driving the reforms of monetary and fiscal policies in  India since the 1990s. Accordingly, even as monetary policy provided stable  monetary and financial conditions, which aided the fiscal reform process, it has  had to undergo significant change in formulation and conduct in order to cope  with the changing contours of fiscal policy and the new dynamics of monetary- fiscal coordination.    Monetary Policy since the 1990s    The simultaneous institution of macroeconomic stabilisation and structural  reforms in response to the fiscal/balance of payments crisis in 1990-91 brought in  fundamental changes in the conduct of monetary policy in India in terms of a   22   clearer recognition of the hierarchy of objectives, adjustments in the operating  framework, choice of instruments, and institutional deepening. During the difficult  years of transition in the early 1990s, monetary policy performed the role of  nominal anchor for an economy undergoing a deep-seated structural  transformation. Tight monetary control set the stage for fiscal stabilisation and  consolidation and a wide range of reforms encompassing the real, financial and  external sectors of the economy.  In addition, the setting of monetary policy had  to adapt to the new challenges being thrown up by the reform process. First, the  diffusion of financial sector reforms was altering the processes of financial  intermediation and the channels of policy transmission.  Second, progressive  international integration of the economy as a part of reforms was increasingly  subjecting the conduct of monetary policy to exogenous influences from the  external environment.       Objectives  The case for price stability as the dominant objective of monetary policy  began to assume importance in the early 1990s (RBI, 2004). This acquired a new  urgency as strong capital flows expanded liquidity sizeably and began to push  inflation into double digits in the mid-1990s.  In response, monetary conditions  were tightened sharply, producing a significant and lasting disinflation during the  second half of the 1990s, thereby demonstrating the commitment of monetary  policy to ensuring price stability. In the subsequent years up to 2003, monetary  policy pursued an accommodative stance as the economy slowed down, with an  explicit policy preference during the period for a softer interest rate regime while  continuing a constant vigil on the inflation front.    The objectives of monetary policy have evolved as those of maintaining price  stability and ensuring an adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the  economy. In essence, monetary policy aims to maintain a judicious balance  between price stability and economic growth. The relative emphasis between the  two is governed by the prevailing circumstances at a particular point of time, and  consequently, there is an ongoing rebalancing of priorities.  With the opening up of the Indian economy and the spread of financial sector  reforms aimed at functional autonomy, prudential strengthening, operational  efficiency and competitiveness of banks, considerations of financial stability have  assumed greater importance in recent years alongside the increasing openness   23   of the Indian economy. Episodes of financial volatility, often sparked off by  sudden switches in capital flows in response to various shocks - such as the East  Asian financial crisis, sanctions after the nuclear explosions, downgrading of  credit ratings, the meltdown of the information technology bubble and the  September 11 US terrorist attacks - required swift monetary policy responses.  The Reserve Bank, therefore, began to emphasise the need to ensure orderly  conditions in financial markets as an important concern of monetary  management. Consequently, financial stability is now being recognised as a key  consideration in the conduct of monetary policy. In fact, financial stability has  ascended the hierarchy of monetary policy objectives since the second half of the  1990s. It is interesting that, in response to the ongoing financial turbulence in  North America and Europe, monetary authorities in these jurisdictions have also  given increased explicit importance to the goal of maintaining financial stability.  The specific features of the Indian economy, including its socio-economic  characteristics, predicate the investing of the monetary authority with multiple  objectives for some time to come.  A single objective for monetary policy, as is  usually advocated, particularly in an inflation targeting (IT) framework, is not likely  to be appropriate for India, at least over the medium term. Apart from the  legitimate concern regarding growth as a key objective, there are other factors  that suggest that inflation targeting may not be appropriate for India. First, unlike  many other developing countries, we have had a record of moderate inflation,  with double digit inflation being the exception, and which is largely socially  unacceptable.  Inflation targeting has been especially useful in countries that  have experienced high inflation prior to the adoption of inflation targeting.  Second, adoption of inflation targeting requires the existence of an efficient  monetary transmission mechanism through the operation of efficient financial  markets and absence of interest rate distortions. In India, although the money  market, government debt and forex market have indeed developed in recent  years, they still have some way to go, whereas the corporate debt market is still  to develop. Moreover, a number of administered interest rates continue to be in  existence to serve certain perceived public or social purposes. Third, inflationary  pressures still often emanate from significant supply shocks, emanating  particularly from external sources in energy and from the weather dependent  food economy. Targeting some theoretical "core inflation" rate, which excludes a  significant portion of any inflation index in a low income economy, would have   24   little utility. Finally, in an economy as large as that of India, with various  regional differences, and continued existence of market imperfections in factor  and product markets between regions, the choice of a universally acceptable  measure of inflation is also difficult (Mohan, 2006).  Internationally, there is no unique or even best way of monetary policy  making and different approaches or frameworks can lead to successful policies  by adapting appropriately to diverse institutional, economic and social  environments (Issing, 2004). Moreover, some evidence suggests that average  inflation as well as its volatility in prominent non-IT industrial countries has, in  fact, been somewhat lower than that in prominent IT industrial countries. IT is not  found to have any beneficial effect on the level of long-term interest rates either  (Gramlich, 2003; Ball and Sheridan, 2003). Emerging market economies (EMEs)  face additional problems in an IT regime. These economies are typically more  open and this exposes them to large exchange rate shocks that can have a  significant influence on short-run inflation.  Furthermore, food items continue to  have a significantly larger weight in the price indices in developing economies  and, food inflation, as reinforced by the recent cross-country evidence, can be a  major contributor to headline inflation (Table 10). This can also render difficulties  in short-term inflation forecasting and management, especially in the EMEs. In  such an environment, focussing on core inflation may not be meaningful.    Table 10: Headline and Food Inflation  (Per cent) Region Headline Inflation Food Inflation Contribution of Food  Inflation to Headline  Inflation  2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 World 3.43.93.46.227.0 44.3 Advanced Economies 2.3 2.2 2.0 3.0 12.4 19.5 Africa 7.27.48.58.746.6 43.6 Commonwealth of 9.3 9.6 8.5 9.2 40.0 41.1 Independent States  Developing Asia 3.7 4.9 4.4 10.0 37.7 67.5 Central and Eastern 5.2 5.4 4.6 8.2 22.0 34.9 Europe  Middle East 3.4 10.1 5.1 13.6 57.0 42.3 Western Hemisphere 5.4 5.4 4.5 8.5 23.1 40.8 Source: World Economic Outlook (April 2008), IMF.      25   An empirical evaluation of the experience of EMEs that have adopted  IT confirms that IT is a more challenging task in such economies compared to  developed economies that have adopted IT. While inflation in EMEs was indeed  lower after they adopted IT, their performance was not as good as that  experienced in  developed IT countries. Deviation of inflation from its targets is  found to be larger and more common in EMEs (Fraga, Minella and Goldfaj,  2003). In this context, it is interesting to note that a very recent comprehensive  survey by Alan Blinder and others (2008) is also sceptical of the benefits of IT  regimes. To quote from the study:   In conclusion, the evidence suggests that adopting an inflation  target may have beneficial effects by lowering inflation, by de-linking long- run inflation expectations from short-run data, and by reducing inflation  persistence. However, these estimated benefits may reflect a kind of  selectivity bias: They seem to accrue primarily to countries that succeed  in stabilizing inflation. There appears to be no systematic difference in the  economic performance of low-inflation countries with and without explicit  inflation targets.   Accordingly, we conclude that inflation targeting is one way, but  certainly not the only way, to control inflation and inflationary  expectations. One clear alternative is establishing an anti-inflation track  record that allows economic agents to make reasonably accurate  inferences about the central banks objectives and strategy.    Operating Framework  By the late 1990s, the process of financial liberalisation necessitated a  re-look at the framework of monetary targeting and the efficiency of using broad  money as an intermediate target of monetary policy. It was increasingly felt that  the dominant effect on the demand for money in the near future need not  necessarily be real income, as it had in the past. Interest rates seemed to  exercise increasing influence on the decisions to hold money (RBI, 1998).  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank formally adopted a multiple indicator approach in  April 1998. Besides broad money which remains as an information variable, a  host of macroeconomic indicators including interest rates or rates of return in  different markets (money, capital and government securities markets) along with  such data as on currency, credit extended by banks and financial institutions,  fiscal position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinancing and  transactions in foreign exchange available on high frequency basis are  juxtaposed with output data for drawing policy perspectives in the process of  monetary policy formulation.    26   As channels of monetary policy transmission shift course as a result of  financial liberalisation, the central bank has to naturally operate through all the  paths that transmit its policy impulses to the real economy. Given the  environment of high uncertainty in which monetary authorities operate in many  emerging market economies like India, a single model or a limited set of  indicators is not a sufficient guide for the conduct of monetary policy. The  multiple indicators approach provides the required "encompassing and  integrated set of data" for this purpose (RBI, 2004).    Choice of Instruments  With the shift away from the monetary targeting framework towards a  multiple indicator approach in the late 1990s, the operating procedures of  monetary policy in India have undergone a significant shift. The liberalisation of  the Indian economy required a comprehensive recast of the operating  procedures of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank had to shift from direct to  indirect instruments of monetary policy in consonance with the increasing market  orientation of the economy. Even within the set of indirect instruments, the  preference is for relatively more market-based instruments such as open market  operations. Accordingly, the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was gradually lowered  from 15 per cent in the early 1990s to 4.50 per cent by 2004, with the stated  objective of further reduction to at least 3 per cent, but then had to be raised in  steps to 9.00 per cent by August 2008 to deal with the evolving liquidity situation  in the economy. In view of some liquidity pressures in the aftermath of the  accentuation of the financial crisis in the major advanced economies in early  October 2008, the Reserve Bank cut the CRR, in phases, by 350 basis points to  5.5 per cent as of November 2008 (see Mohan, 2008c). Recent developments in  the Indian context shows that CRR can be used as an instrument of sterilisation  and monetary management under extreme conditions of excess liquidity by a  prudent monetary authority (RBI, 2004).   As a part of the financial sector reforms process, the statutory liquidity ratio  (SLR) was also brought down from its peak of 38.5 per cent to the then statutory  floor of 25 per cent in 1997. However, based on their risk-return assessment, the  banks, in the subsequent period, continued to voluntarily hold Government  securities well in excess of the required 25 per cent. The Banking Regulation Act  was amended in 2007 and the statutory floor of 25 per cent has been dispensed   27   with and the Reserve Bank has been provided the discretion to prescribe the  SLR, taking into the evolving macroeconomic and monetary conditions. This is  expected to provide greater maneuverability to the Reserve Bank in its conduct  of monetary policy, but is dependent on the continuing pursuit of fiscal prudence  that enables the reduction of such pre-emptions from banks.  As more resources  are intermediated on market considerations, the effectiveness of monetary policy  would also improve. In order to alleviate liquidity pressures emanating from the  global financial crisis, the Reserve Bank, on September 16, 2008, announced,  as a temporary and ad hoc measure, that scheduled banks could avail additional  liquidity support under the LAF to the extent of up to one per cent of their NDTL  and seek waiver of penal interest. It has subsequently (November 1) decided to  make this reduction permanent. Accordingly, the SLR stands reduced to 24 per  cent of NDTL, effective the fortnight beginning November 8, 2008.  In the new environment, short-term interest rates have emerged as  instruments to signal the stance of monetary policy. In order to stabilise short- term interest rates, the Reserve Bank now modulates market liquidity to steer  monetary conditions to the desired trajectory. This is achieved by a mix of policy  instruments including changes in reserve requirements and standing facilities  and open market (including repo) operations which affect the quantum of  marginal liquidity and changes in policy rates, such as the Bank Rate and  reverse repo/repo rates, which impact the price of liquidity.    Liquidity Adjustment Facility  Reforms in the monetary policy operating framework led to the introduction of  the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) in 2000. Under the LAF, the Reserve Bank  sets its policy rates, i.e., repo and reverse repo rates and carries out  repo/reverse repo operations, thereby providing a corridor for overnight money  market rates. The LAF has settled into a fixed rate overnight auction mode since  April 2004. LAF operations continue to be supplemented by access to the  Reserve Banks standing facilities linked to the LAF repo rate - export credit  refinance to banks and standing liquidity facility to the primary dealers.  The introduction of LAF has had several advantages. First, it made possible  the transition from direct instruments of monetary control to indirect instruments.  Second, LAF has provided greater flexibility in determining both the quantum of  adjustment as well as the rates by responding to the needs of the system on a   28   daily basis. Third and most importantly, though there is no formal targeting of a  point overnight interest rate, LAF has helped to stabilise overnight call rates  within a specified corridor, i.e., the difference between the fixed repo and reverse  repo rates (150 basis points as of November 2008). The width of the corridor has  varied from 100 to 300 basis points since the introduction of uniform price auction  from March 2004. In response to the emerging market conditions, the reverse  repo rate had been reduced to 4.5 per cent by August 2003, but then had to be  raised to 6.0 per cent. Correspondingly the repo rate was reduced to 6.00 per  cent in March 2004 and was then raised in 10 steps to 9.00 per cent by July  2008. Since then, the repo rate has been cut by 150 basis points to 7.5 per cent  in response to the to the evolving global and domestic macroeconomic and  monetary conditions. The LAF has thus enabled the Reserve Bank to affect  demand for funds through policy rate changes. The LAF is also effective in  modulating liquidity in the economy, which is affected continuously by changes in  government cash balances, and by the volatility in excess capital flows.      Open Market Operations  Since the onset of reforms, as part of the shift to indirect instruments of  monetary policy, the Reserve Bank reactivated open market operations (OMO)  as an instrument of monetary management. This was enabled by a transition to a  system of market determined interest rates in Government securities and the  development of an adequate institutional framework in the Government securities  market. Active use of OMO for mitigating inflationary pressures was undertaken  during 1993-1995 in the wake of unprecedented capital flows and the  consequent higher monetary expansion, as the exchange rate system became  market-based.  The Reserve Bank had to divest Government securities from its  portfolio through the OMO so as to sterilise the monetary impact of the capital  inflows and to restrain inflationary pressures. Thus, the Reserve Banks recourse  to OMO sales acted as a substitute to a possible hike in CRR and obviated the  need to resort to an across-the-board monetary tightening.  An important prerequisite for the Reserve Bank to modulate primary  liquidity conditions by operating the OMO is for it to have an adequate stock of  Government securities in its portfolio. The increasing market participation in the  primary issuance of Government securities, and the Reserve Banks predominant  use of OMO sales from its portfolio of Government securities for absorbing the   29   excess liquidity prevailing almost continuously since 1998-99 resulted in  a steady depletion of marketable securities available on its own account by 2003.  The LAF instrument, which was introduced to manage liquidity only at the  margin, therefore, became a tool for managing enduring liquidity and was losing  its efficacy as an instrument to manage short-term liquidity. In order to avoid such  problems, the market stabilisation scheme was operationalised from April 2004 in  order to supplement OMO for liquidity management.     Market Stabilisation Scheme   The money markets have generally operated in a liquidity surplus mode since  2002 due to large capital inflows. Keeping in view the objective of absorbing the  liquidity of enduring nature by using instruments other than LAF, new instruments  for sterilising excess capital flows were introduced in early 2004 (RBI, 2003). The  Government agreed to allow the Reserve Bank to issue T-bills and dated  securities under a new Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) where the proceeds  of MSS bonds are held by the Government in a separate identifiable cash  account maintained and operated by RBI. The amounts credited into the MSS  Account are appropriated only for the purpose of redemption of these  instruments. These securities have all the attributes of existing T-bills and dated  securities and indistinguishable from regular government securities in the hands  of the creditors. They are serviced like any other marketable government  securities but their interest costs are shown separately in the budget. At the  same time, there is an increase in the holdings of the Reserve Banks foreign  currency assets, which leads to higher earnings for the Reserve Bank and these  are mirrored in higher surplus profit transfers to the Central Government from the  Reserve Bank. Thus, the interest expenses incurred by the Government on  account of issuances under the MSS are offset by higher transfers from the  Reserve Bank (Table 11).   30     Table 11: Fiscal Impact of the Market Stabilisation Scheme  (Rupees billion) Item 2004- 2005- 2006-07 2007-08 05 06 1 234 5 Balances under Market Stabilisation Scheme  (MSS) (outstanding, end-March) 642 291 630 1,684 Interest paid by the Government on issuances  under the MSS during the year (April-March)  21 34 26 84 Foreign Currency Assets of the Reserve Bank  (outstanding, end-March)  5,931 6,473 8,366 11,960 Net Disposable Income of the Reserve Bank  during the year (July-June)  54 84 114 150 Surplus Transfer from the Reserve Bank to the  Central Government during the year (July- June) 54 84 114 @ 150 n.a.: not available.  @: Excluding profits on sale of shares of State Bank of India.     For mopping up enduring surplus liquidity, a policy choice exists between the  central bank issuing its own securities or government issuing additional  securities. A large number of countries, such as, Chile, China, Colombia,  Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and  Thailand have issued central bank securities. However, central banks in many of  these countries have faced deterioration in their balance sheets. As such, there  is merit in issuing sterilisation bonds on government account. This is more so, in  case of an already well established government debt market, where issuing of  new central bank bills of overlapping maturity could cause considerable  confusion and possible market segmentation which could obfuscate the yield  curve, reduce liquidity of the instruments and make operations that much more  difficult.   The MSS has considerably strengthened the Reserve Banks ability to  conduct capital account and monetary management operations. It has allowed  absorption of surplus liquidity by instruments of short term (91-day, 182-day and  364-day T-bills) and the medium-term (dated Government securities) maturity.  Generally, the preference has been for the short-term instruments. This has  given the monetary authority a greater degree of freedom in liquidity  management during transitions in liquidity conditions. In response to the  tightening of domestic liquidity brought about by the global financial crisis, the   31   MSS is being unwound, both on account of normal redemptions as well  as through buy-back of MSS dated securities. These operations have provided  another avenue for injecting liquidity of a more durable nature into the system  and highlight the flexibility provided by the MSS.    Prudential Instruments   In the wake of the persistence of global financial imbalances against the  background of low and stable inflation in a world undergoing fundamental  change, there has been growing support for greater macro-prudential orientation  of the financial regulatory/supervisory framework in order to support monetary  policy.  There is a gradual realisation that while the success in fighting inflation  has been extraordinary, price stability has not been sufficient to secure financial  stability (Borio and Shim, 2007). In the current context in which financial factors,  in general, and asset prices in particular, are acting as drivers of economic  fluctuations, the country experiences across Europe and Asia (including India)  have placed a premium on strengthening the macro-prudential orientation of  policies for financial regulation/supervision.   It has been argued in an orthodox perspective that prudential regulations,  originally designed for financial stability, are not very effective in addressing  asset price cycles due to the time lag in transmission and the relatively blunt  impact with unintended secondary consequences. Moreover, the use of such  tools for macroeconomic purposes is seen as conflicting with their original  objective of financial stability. However, the more contemporary, pragmatic view  advocates the use of prudential regulations to dampen excessive credit growth in  pursuit of financial stability as the first instance policy response, followed at a  later stage, if required, by tightening monetary policy (White, 2004).  Accordingly, prudential measures have supplemented monetary measures in  realising the objectives of monetary policy in India. In this regard, India has been  one of the earliest users of prudential measures (Mohan, 2007b). The high rate  of credit expansion witnessed in certain sectors during 2003-07 was partly  moderated through the use of prudential measures such as enhancement of  provisioning requirements and risk weights rather than resorting to monetary  tightening which would have resulted in an overall credit squeeze and thwarted  the growth momentum.  The use of such prudential measures is now gaining   32   increasing acceptability in the wake of turmoil in international financial markets  currently.    Institutional Deepening  A key prerequisite of the growing market orientation of monetary policy is an  appropriate legal and institutional architecture. Institutional changes to improve  the effectiveness of monetary policy formed the core of the emerging format of  monetary-fiscal coordination. In India these reforms, inter alia, involved raising  fiscal borrowings at market-related yields and the phasing out of automatic  monetisation by the Reserve Bank from the mid-1990s. Fiscal-monetary  coordination in India was strengthened further through the enactment of the  FRBM Act, 2003. The FRBM Act, while placing limits on deficits, prohibits the  Reserve Bank from participating in the primary market auctions of Central  Government securities from April 2006, except by way of Ways and Means  Advances to meet temporary liquidity mismatches in Governments cash  management, or under exceptional circumstances. The Reserve Bank, however,  still buys or sells Government securities in the secondary market consistent with  the conduct of monetary policy. Adherence to FRBM targets is critical for the  objective of maintaining price stability, and more importantly, to stabilise inflation  expectations in the economy. In the context of monetary-fiscal interface, as noted  by Reddy (2008),   harmonious relations between the Government and the RBI have, no  doubt, generally contributed to the successful policy outcomes thus far, but it  would not be appropriate to conclude that there are no differences in  analyses, approaches, judgements and instrumentalities. In the given legal  and cultural context, while making every effort to give its views, either  informally or formally, but as unambiguously as possible, the RBI generally  respects the wishes and final inclination of the Government. The RBI,  however, has to accept the responsibility for all its decisions and actions,  while being generally conscious of the impact of its articulation and actions on  its credibility. The Government, for its part, recognises the dilemmas posed to  the RBI, and accords significant weight to the RBIs judgements.  In sum, de jure, the RBI has not been accorded autonomy on par  with recent trends in some of the industrialised as well as emerging  economies; but, de facto, the recent experience reflects a progressively  higher degree of autonomy being enjoyed by the RBI. During the period of  reform, since 1991, there has been a gradual and mutually agreed progress  towards greater autonomy in matters relating particularly to the financial  markets and the conduct of monetary policy.   33     Market Development  A key element of structural reforms has been a greater role for markets in  the allocation of resources. First, the Reserve Bank began to deregulate interest  rates, beginning with the removal of restrictions on the inter-bank market as  early as 1989. This was supported by the process of putting the market  borrowing programme of the Government through the auction process in 1992- 93. This was buttressed by a phased deregulation of lending rates in the credit  markets. At present, banks are free to fix their lending rates on all classes of  loans except small loans below Rs.200,000. The deregulation of deposit rates  began from 1997 and banks are now free to offer interest rates on all classes of  domestic deposits (except savings deposits), not only in terms of tenor but also  in terms of size.    Second, the process of interest rate deregulation had to be supported by  the development of the market structure, especially to address the problem of  missing markets at the short end. A number of money market instruments, such  as commercial paper, short-term Treasury Bills, certificates of deposit, and the  like have been introduced progressively, supplemented by a parallel process of  market development, beginning with the institution of the Discount and Finance  House of India in 1988 as a market maker with two-way quotes in the money  markets.    Third, steps were initiated in 1999 to develop a repo market outside the  official window for providing a stable collateralised funding alternative, particularly  to non-banks and banks. A recent noteworthy development is the substantial  migration of money market activity from the uncollateralised call money segment  to the collateralised market repo and Collateralised and Borrowing Lending  Obligation (CBLO) markets which together account for more than 80 per cent of  overnight money market. Thus, uncollateralised overnight transactions are now  limited to banks and primary dealers in the interest of financial stability.  Technological upgradation has accompanied the development of the money  market  real time gross settlement; screen-based negotiated quote-driven  dealings in call/notice and term money markets; and the Clearing Corporation of  India Ltd. (CCIL) as a central counter party for CBLO.  Information on overnight  rates and volumes is disseminated by the Reserve Bank in order to enable   34   market participants to assess the liquidity conditions in an efficient and  transparent manner.  There was also a need to develop a benchmark for other fixed income  instruments for the purposes of their pricing and valuation. An active secondary  market for government securities was also needed for operating monetary policy  through indirect instruments such as open market operations and repos.  Reforms, therefore, focussed on the development of appropriate market  infrastructure, elongation of maturity profile, increasing the width and depth of the  market, improving risk management practices and increasing transparency.  Consequently, the government securities market has witnessed  significant transformation in various dimensions, viz., market-based price  discovery, widening of investor base, introduction of new instruments,  establishment of primary dealers, and electronic trading and settlement  infrastructure. Vibrant secondary market trading has helped to develop a yield  curve and the term structure of interest rates.   The Indian foreign exchange market was widened and deepened   significantly with the transition to a market-determined exchange rate system in  March 1993,  the subsequent liberalisation of restrictions on various external  transactions leading up to current account convertibility in 1994 and the ongoing  liberalisation of the capital account.  Indias exchange rate policy in recent years  has been guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management  of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a pre-announced target  or a band, coupled with the ability to intervene if and when necessary, while  allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions to determine the  exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way. Subject to this  predominant objective, the exchange rate policy is guided by the need to reduce  excess volatility, prevent the emergence of destabilising speculative activities,  help maintain adequate level of reserves, and develop an orderly foreign  exchange market.   A number of steps have also been taken to liberalise the capital account  covering foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, outward investment  including direct investment as well as depository receipt and convertible bonds,  opening of Indian corporate offices abroad and the like.     35   In line with the international best practices and with a view to further  strengthening the consultative process in monetary policy, the Reserve Bank, in  July 2005, set up a Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy (TACMP)  with external experts in the areas of monetary economics, central banking,  financial markets and public finance, along with two members of its Central  Board, Deputy Governors and chaired by the Governor.  The Committee meets  at least once in a quarter to review macroeconomic and monetary developments  and advise on the stance of monetary policy.  The TAC is advisory and provides  guidance to the making of policy from time to time. As such, the responsibility,  accountability and time paths for decision making are not formally constrained by  the meetings of the TAC.  As each of these segments of the financial market  money market,  government securities market, foreign exchange market  develop further,  monetary policy can become more effective through improved monetary policy  transmission.  Monetary Policy Performance: An Assessment of Outcomes      Indias monetary policy framework  goals, operating framework,  instruments, communication  has undergone a fundamental change since the  early 1990s.  It is noteworthy that this change has coincided with regime shifts  across many parts of the world, with the adoption of inflation targeting (IT) being  perhaps the most widely discussed case in point. Have these regime shifts,  including in India, worked. A credible approach to evaluating the efficiency of  monetary policy is perhaps to focus on actual outcomes.   Purely for the purpose of analysis, this assessment can be classified as  under:   (i) operating condition indicators;  (ii) intermediate indicators; and  (iii) ultimate goals    Operating Conditions Indicators    The key objective underlying the operating framework of monetary policy  in India is to ensure stable conditions in financial markets by moderating volatility  through a flexible use of policy instruments but without a specific view on the  level of financial prices.  In the money market, the Reserve Banks operations are  conducted with a view to allowing the overnight interest rates to evolve in a   36   stable manner within an informal corridor set by the LAF so that policy  changes in quantities and rates are transmitted to other interest rates in an  efficient manner.  Indias exchange rate policy is one of managed flexibility  without any target or band but with interventions by the Reserve Bank to ensure  orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market.  In the Government securities  market, the objective has been to develop depth and liquidity and a smooth  sovereign yield curve that could serve as a benchmark for pricing of other  financial instruments. A comparison of movements in these key markets across  the decades of the 1990s and the 2000s (up to 2007) indicates a marked decline  in the weighted average call money rate and in its variability (Table 12).  This  moderation of volatility is also reflected in a narrowing of the bid-ask spread over  time, indicative of the smoothing role played by the evolving market  microstructure.

Source: Reserve Bank of India, NSE-FIMMDA    37     In the foreign exchange market, there is evidence of growing flexibility in  the day-to-day movements in the exchange rate of the Indian rupee, consistent  with the stated objective of exchange rate management (Table 13 and Chart 3).  Average daily absolute change in the exchange rate of the rupee has seen a  consistent rise over the years. During the 1990s, there were large discrete  changes in the exchange rate, while the exchange rate was relatively unchanged  for the rest of the time. In contrast, in the past few years, there has been a higher  degree of two-way movements in the exchange rate on day-to-day basis. At the  same time, the Reserve Bank tries to avoid excessive volatility in the foreign  exchange market through its market operations.  There has also been a  substantial rise in turnover in the forex market. In the Government securities  market, there has been a general softening of yields (until recent months) across  maturities; however, volatility has increased in the current period, attributable to  greater external integration of the market and rising trading volumes. Yield  spreads have also tended to narrow over this period, pointing to a flattening of  the yield curve as long term inflation expectations have become anchored and  policy interventions in the short end of the money market have increased in  frequency (see Table 12).

With the weakening of the explanatory/predictive power of the standard  money demand functions and its variants, the list of intermediate variables has  expanded to include the underlying determinants of money i.e., credit and  deposits with a view to also deriving synergies from the responsibility for financial  stability where it is reposed in the central bank as in India.     In terms of average growth rates, non-food credit and bank credit to the  commercial sector have increased in the period 2000-07 over the 1990s in  consonance with an upward shift in the growth trajectory of the economy. On the  other hand, growth rates of aggregate deposits and money supply have  remained broadly stable.  A comparison of volatility in these indicators yields  contrasting variations.  The credit indicators display a marked decline in volatility  despite a step-up in growth.  The growth of aggregate deposits and money  supply is, however, associated with some increase in volatility in the period 2000- 07, suggesting some causal relationship flowing from deposits to money supply   39 Rupees per US dollar   reflecting strong pro-cyclicity as well as relatively larger swings in market  liquidity (Table 14).

In terms of the variability of  real GDP growth, India outperformed most EMEs and developed economies  during the 1990s.  While variability of output growth has increased modestly  during 2000-07, India continues to experience stability in growth conditions along  with some developed countries and EMEs that have adopted inflation targeting  as a common feature. Inter-temporally, most economies have recorded a decline  in volatility of output growth, outliers being Argentina and Singapore (Table 15).  Of course, the stability in the growth conditions cannot be attributed entirely to  the conduct of monetary policy; it is also attributable to other key developments  such as better inventory management by firms, growing use of information  technology, rising share of the services sector activity in output and overall  stability in the policy framework. Furthermore, it is important to note that India's  growth is largely driven by domestic consumption. As consumption is the less  volatile component of demand, this has also contributed in containing volatility.     40      Table 15: Variations in Real GDP  A Cross-Country Survey      (per cent) Country 1990s 2000-07   Average  Coefficient of Average Coefficient of Variation  Annual Variation Annual  Growth Growth  1 2 3 4 5   Developed Countries  Australia 3.3 59.5 3.3 23.3  Canada 2.4 96.6 2.9 36.1  France 1.9 69.2 2.0 45.4  Germany 2.3 80.1 1.4 91.5  Japan 1.5 132.3 1.7 59.3  New Zealand 2.5 105.1 3.4 34.0  Switzerland 1.1 128.6 1.9 69.2  US 3.1 46.8 2.5 40.4  UK 2.1 81.0 2.8 23.6    Developing Countries  Argentina 4.3 119.8 3.4 230.3  Brazil 1.7 175.8 3.3 48.4  China 10.0 32.4 9.9 11.8  Egypt 4.1 53.5 4.7 33.0  India 5.7 30.0 7.0 31.4  Indonesia 4.3 149.7 5.1 15.8  Korea 6.3 78.8 5.1 34.4  Malaysia 7.2 73.1 5.4 45.9  Mexico 3.4 106.0 2.9 75.1  Philippines 2.8 86.1 5.0 29.6  Singapore 7.6 48.4 5.7 70.0  South Africa 1.4 149.2 4.2 21.8  Thailand 5.3 124.7 4.9 30.1  Source: World Economic Outlook Database, IMF    In terms of inflation volatility, the Indian experience has been more  rewarding. Over the 1990s and up to the recent period, variability of inflation in  India has been low, attesting to the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing  the inflation-risk premium. During this period, improvement in the fiscal scenario  has also contributed towards the moderation in inflation and inflation  expectations. The significant turnaround in the inflation outcome reflected the  improved monetary-fiscal interface during this period. Over time, however,  several EMEs have recorded an increase in inflation volatility, particularly in the  current decade.  By contrast, India appears to have joined the great moderation  that has characterised the developed world  there is a distinct decline in inflation  variability in India in 2000-07 in consonance with developed countries and a few   41   EMEs which undertook structural changes in their policy regimes in  response to their inflation history i.e., Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia (Table 16).

Issues and Challenges in Monetary and Fiscal Policy Formulation    The biggest challenge facing the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy in  India is to continue the accelerated growth process while maintaining price and  financial stability.  The conduct of fiscal and monetary policy since the early 1990s has  broadly succeeded in setting the economy on a higher growth path. Far reaching  fiscal reforms have been undertaken during this period, which are finally bearing  fruit through increased revenue mobilisation, some compression in expenditure,   42   and consequent reduction in the fiscal deficit, leading to the beginning of some  reduction in the debt GDP ratio. The exercise of fiscal restraint and admirable  fiscal and monetary policy cooperation has enabled the increasing effectiveness  of monetary policy: the cessation of automatic monetisation of the fiscal deficit;  increased importance of market borrowing in financing the deficit; introduction of  the market stabilisation scheme; and the corresponding measures to deregulate  interest rates to enable market discovery; have all contributed to the  strengthening of monetary policy transmission.  Where do we go from here? What are the remaining issues and new  challenges in this space that have to be confronted in the coming years?  The self imposed rule based fiscal correction at both the national and sub  national levels has to be consolidated and carried forward. Achievement of the  current objectives will still leave the combined fiscal deficit in India at around 6  percent of GDP, and somewhat higher if the off budget items are also taken into  account. By international standards this is still very high, and if this level  continues it will be difficult to make much of a correction to the debt-GDP ratio to  bring it down to desirable levels within the foreseeable future. The government  draft on private sector savings will therefore continue, and hence it will also be  difficult to reduce substantially the various stipulations that mandate banks and  other financial institutions to invest in government securities, thereby constraining  further development in monetary policy and financial sector framework. The  existence of such a high level of fiscal deficit also contributes to the persistence  of an interest rate differential with the rest of the world, which then also  constrains progress towards full capital account convertibility.  The sustained interest rate differential is also connected with the  existence of a persistent inflation differential with the rest of the world. As  documented, significant success has been achieved in reducing Indian medium  term inflation, and inflation expectations, from the erstwhile 7-8 per cent to the  current 4-5 per cent, as compared to the 2-3 per cent that has characterised  world inflation in recent years (abstracting from the current flare up worldwide). A  key challenge for fiscal and monetary policy in the coming years is to further  reduce inflation expectations toward international levels. In view of higher  inflation rates, higher interest rates, and exchange rate dynamics reflecting  growth prospects and capital account movements, rather than inflation or interest  rate differentials, there is a need to operate an intermediate regime with a   43   managed floating exchange rate, and an active management of the capital  account so as to have the necessary discretion and flexibility to operate  monetary policy in order to maintain domestic macroeconomic and financial  stability. In particular, ceilings on debt flows to minimise short-term speculative  flows will need to be continued.  In the fiscal policy area, the success achieved in revenue buoyancy  through tax rationalisation and compliance has to be strengthened further. Large  proportions of the self employed remain outside the tax net; thus continued  strengthening and modernisation of tax administration now needs to be  emphasised, relative to further reforms in tax policy in terms of relative emphasis.  This would enable further shifts in tax revenue toward direct taxes from indirect  taxes, thereby aiding greater economic efficiency. At the state level also, the  move to VAT has provided very significant tax rationalisation, and emphasis now  needs to be put on its administration. In this sphere, the next step of reform  would, of course, be the proposed move towards a unified Goods and Service  Tax regime encompassing the Centre and the States. The foundations of an  efficient fiscal regime in India have, therefore, been achieved.  On the expenditure side, containing the subsidy burden has proved  difficult, although its increase as a proportion of GDP has been contained. The  current world environment of elevated oil, food and fertilizer prices is not  conducive to the expectation of significant reduction in these subsidies in the  near future. The prognosis on international prices of energy and food is not  encouraging in the medium term as of now. So public policy in these areas has to  take into account expectations over the medium term: smoothening of prices of  such important items of common consumption can be justified if elevated prices  are deemed to be temporary. Funding such subsidies over an extended period of  time is likely to become unsustainable: hence directly addressing the needs of  those less well off and who are less capable of coping with these price increases  may be more desirable, rather than suppressing prices overall. The recent  practice of issuing bonds to fund these subsidies is also not sustainable if the  need for these subsidies persists.   The second issue on the expenditure side relates to the funding of public  investment, particularly related to infrastructure. As documented, public  investment has been reduced over the past decade or so. Whereas private  investment has clearly substituted or complemented public investment   44   successfully in areas such as telecom, ports and airports, and partially in roads  and power, total investment in infrastructure is clearly inadequate, and could  constrain further acceleration in overall economic growth. With increasing  urbanization there is need for accelerated public investment in infrastructure.  While processes for inducing private investment need continuous improvement,  there is need for a reassessment of desirable, expected and feasible public  investment requirements, which are likely to be higher than what is currently  envisaged. Third, the government is already engaged in expanding programmes  and spending for human development. Funding for these needs will continue to  require enhancement.         The acceleration of economic growth to the next level is therefore likely to  lead to an enhancement of government spending as a proportion of GDP, which  would be consistent with the experience of other countries as their per capita  incomes increased. This then is the main challenge confronting Indian fiscal  policy: how to provide for an enhancement in public expenditure while continuing  fiscal consolidation and reducing fiscal deficits further.   Going forward, therefore, there will be a continuous need to adapt  monetary management to the emerging needs of a fast growing and increasingly  open economy. This will necessitate ongoing refinement of instruments and  modes of management, especially as global developments are expected to have  an increasing role in determining the conduct of monetary and exchange rate  policies in India. As an economy undergoes accelerated growth from low income  levels, it is typically accompanied by financial deepening and increasing  monetisation. Consequently, the expansion of monetary aggregates departs from  their traditional relationship with real GDP growth. The task of monetary  management is then to manage such growth without endangering price or  financial stability.   Considerable progress has been made in interest rate deregulation but  full deregulation is constrained by the need for various policy interventions in the  context of a still developing economy, on both the deposit and lending sides. A  certain degree of credit allocation and interest rate directions continues to exist.  Hence, monetary transmission can get muted at the margin. As banks have to  compete for funds with small saving schemes, the rates offered on long-term  deposits mobilised by banks sometimes have to account for these administered  rates. The administered small saving rates have to be sensitive to the   45   maintenance of positive real interest rates. Thus, further deregulation of  interest rates is also dependent on the reduction in inflation mentioned earlier.  In the years ahead, the economy will depend increasingly upon the ability  of financial markets to allocate resources efficiently for the most productive  purposes. Further development of financial markets will also be needed in view  of the growing openness and fuller capital account convertibility. Thus, financial  markets have to be developed continuously to increase their connection with  credit markets and to remove distortions in the market spectrum. While permitting  a wider range of instruments and players in the financial markets, it needs to be  ensured that development takes place in an orderly manner so as to ensure  stability.   Large volume of inflows under private transfers as well as under software  earnings  almost 3 per cent of GDP each  and sizable capital inflows (net)  have the potential for possible overvaluation of the currency and the resultant  erosion of long-term competitiveness of other traditional and goods sectors   popularly known as the Dutch disease. Given the fact that more people are in the  goods sector, the human aspects of the exchange rate management should not  be lost sight of. Therefore, the Dutch Disease syndrome has so far been  managed by way of reserves build-up and sterilisation, the former preventing  excessive nominal appreciation and the latter preventing higher inflation.  However, the issue remains how long and to what extent such an exchange rate  management strategy would work given the fact that we are faced with large and  continuing capital flows apart from strengthening current receipts on account of  remittances and software exports. This issue has assumed increased importance  over the last couple of years with increased capital flows arising from the higher  sustained growth performance of the economy and significant enhancement of  international confidence in the Indian economy.  Large capital inflows in recent years, far in excess of the current account  surplus, have, therefore, necessitated a certain amount of capital account  management, along with intervention in the forex market to curb volatility in the  exchange rate (Mohan, 2007a). Management of volatility in financial markets and  implications for the conduct of monetary operations will continue to need  attention. Greater inflows will inevitably exert pressure on the Reserve Banks  ability to manage the impossible trinity of independent monetary policy, open  capital account and a managed exchange rate, keeping in view that the impact of   46   exchange rate fluctuations on the real sector in developing economies is much  higher than in mature economies, particularly in labour intensive low technology  price sensitive goods. To what extent is the current account balance a good  guide to evaluation of the appropriate level of an exchange rate? To what extent  should the capital account influence the exchange rate? What are the  implications of large current account deficits for the real economy? Are they  sustainable and, if not, what are the implications for financial stability in  developing countries? India always had a modest current account deficit though,  because of remittances and service exports, the trade deficit has widened  significantly in recent years.  These are the issues that monetary policy will have  to continue to deal with while addressing the impact of capital flows.
