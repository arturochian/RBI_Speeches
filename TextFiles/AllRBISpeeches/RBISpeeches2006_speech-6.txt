Economic Reforms in India:Where are We and Where do We Go??Rakesh MohanWe have now had a decade and a half of economic reforms. It isperhaps appropriate at this point to stand back and take stock of what wehave done as we venture further. Today I shall, therefore, make an effort to(a) review what has been done; (b) evaluate where we are; and (c) suggestwhere we need to go.Let me give you the backdrop as to what motivated me to choose thistopic. I recently came across, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Make a BigDifference, by Malcolm Gladwell.  He observes that many large changessometimes happen in a hurry. Whereas there is usually a step by step,gradual process of little changes taking place, an epidemic suddenly acquiresa tipping point and spreads suddenly.  I believe that at the present juncture weare in need of such an epidemic of change and growth; we are perhaps at thetipping point.  The macro-foundations of a healthy environment have been laidand now we need lots of little things to make a big difference.I. What Has Been DoneWhat has been the main objective of the overall economic reformprocess in India, or for that matter, anywhere?  The primary objective has tobe the overall acceleration of economic growth along with rapid elimination ofpoverty.  The means to achieve these objectives would be the injection ofcompetition in the economy in order to induce greater efficiency andproductivity gains; and dedicated efforts are needed to build capacity throughhuman resource development.Let me begin with a broad brush of history.  Around 50 to 100 yearsbefore our independence in 1947, there was hardly any discernible economicgrowth in the whole Indian sub-continent.  Per capita income was stagnant,perhaps declining over that whole long period.  After independence, annualper capita growth broke out of this long period of slumber and was in therange of 1 to 1.5 per cent for about 30 years or so until around 1980.  After1980 it increased to about 3-4 per cent, which was a major departure in ourrecorded history.  Along with this change, a good deal of new thinking alsotook place in terms of the strategy for future economic policy.  As it happened,there was a full blown economic crisis at the end of the 1980s: the balance ofpayments came under severe pressure, and a realistic threat of sovereigndefault loomed over us; fiscal deficits had increased significantly over the1980s; and inflation began to creep up to the late teens.  These unfortunatedevelopments focussed our minds like never before: India has a proud historyof never ever having defaulted on our international objections; our fiscal                                                ? Lecture by Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at a Public Seminar organized by Institute ofSouth Asia Studies in Singapore on November 10, 2006. Views expressed are personal.1management has historically been conservative; and inflation seldomexceeded 10 per cent.Consequently, a whole reform process got unleashed in 1991.I will first give a brief run-down of the various reforms that have takenplace in the last 15 years before providing some evidence of theireffectiveness.  For expository convenience I shall make a conceptualdifference between (a) macroeconomic reforms and (b) microeconomicreforms.Macroeconomic Reforms and Fiscal StabilisationOver a period of time through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s theeconomy had become over controlled and rigid; consequentlyentrepreneurship was heavily constrained. The import substituting inwardlooking development strategy that could have been relevant in the 1950s and1960s was no longer suitable in the modern globalising world.  Hence overallreform had to be undertaken to lay down a new framework.  Wide rangingmacro reforms were undertaken along with corresponding microeconomic andsectoral reforms. The macro reforms can be divided into (a) fiscal policy, (b)monetary policy, (c) trade policy, and (d) exchange rate management. Withoutany claim of exhaustiveness, the exposition aims at setting the context.Fiscal SystemThe tax system, both for direct and indirect taxes, had become verycomplex in India.  Maximum marginal personal income tax rates were high,along with a number of rates for different income ranges.  The corporate taxrate was high too.  Accordingly, the tax code had to be riddled with a numberof special provisions for exemption of different kinds of income, and thecorporate tax code was full of exceptions and incentives.  Because of highrates and complexity, avoidance and evasion was naturally high.  As aconsequence, over the whole reform period, both the personal income tax andcorporate tax rates have gradually been brought down to 30 per cent, alongwith considerable simplification.Similarly, in the case of indirect taxes, there were high levels of bothdomestic excise duties and customs tariffs, with a myriad of rates for differentcommodities.  Again, this necessitated a whole range of specific provisionsand exemptions for different kinds of producers and end uses, leading to greatadministrative complexity. A major programme of comprehensive andcontinuous reform has had to be undertaken over the last 15 years.  The ratesin case of customs duties have been brought down from an average of 110per cent in 1991 (with highs over  400 percent) to a non agricultural peak of12.5 per cent in 2006.  There has been massive simplification of the excisetax structure to achieve a “central” rate (CENVAT) of 16 per cent (apart from afew exceptions like food products, textiles and some optical fibres that attractlower tax rates).  Excise, which is levied at the manufacturing stage, is nowessentially levied as a VAT (Value Added Tax) so that cascading is avoided.In addition, the service tax has been introduced in order to tax the whole2economy more fairly and to reduce the excessive burden on one sector, themanufacturing sector.  Such tax reforms typically take a long time.The latest most significant measure taken is the introduction of theFiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) in 2004, whichenjoins the government to eliminate its revenue deficit and reduce its fiscaldeficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2009.  Similar acts have been passed by moststate governments (23 states so far). So fiscal responsibility has now becomepart of our legislative commitments.  The other most noteworthy developmentat the federal level is the transformation of state level sales taxes to the ValueAdded Tax (VAT), which has introduced a large measure of rationality anduniformity in the state tax system.  The state sales tax system had alsosuffered from great complexity in terms of multiplicity of rates and specialprovisions.  A vital feature of this tax reform has been the consultative processamong all the states as mediated by the central government, which thenresulted in this consensus for massive reform.Overall, the fiscal reform process spanning both the central and stategovernments over the last 15 years has been truly wide ranging.Monetary PolicyOver the 1970s and 1980s, monetary policy, as we know it, hadbecome almost non-existent: with a system of credit allocation, administeredand different interest rates for different purposes; automatic monetization offiscal deficits; and financial repression through pre-emption of banks’resources.Hence a number of measures had to be taken. These include:elimination of automatic monetization, reduction of statutory pre-emption ofthe lendable resource of banks, and interest rate deregulation. As a result ofthese measures independence of monetary policy and the central bank hasbeen restored. There was a consequent movement from direct to indirectinstruments of monetary policy. These changes in the practice of monetarypolicy are manifest in its effectiveness in the significant reduction of inflation.In fact, if one bifurcates the period since independence into two, one from theearly 1950s to late 1990s, and the other since the late-1990s to present day,then there is marked difference in the average inflation rates between the twoperiods. While it was around 7-8 per cent during the first forty five years, it hasfallen to around five per cent in the recent period since the late 1990s.External Sector ReformsIt was the balance of payment crisis in 1991 that was the key trigger forreforms.  Consequently, actions on the external sector have been of thegreatest importance.  Despite the existence of comprehensive quantitativetrade restrictions along with high levels of tariffs, the balance of payments wasunder continuous pressure through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.Consequently, exogenous shocks such as oil price rises, or monsoon failures,invariably led to large crises necessitating recourse to IMF resources.  Withthe existence of these trade restrictions, the exchange rate was typically3overvalued over a long period of time.  Hence, among the first reform moveswas an ex ante real devaluation of the exchange rate in 1991 and a move ofthe exchange rate regime from that of a crawling peg towards a marketdetermined one, though somewhat managed.The trade regime has undergone massive change with the removal ofquantitative restrictions along with rationalisation of the tariff structure. Therehas been a massive reduction in the number of tariff rates and the peak rateof tariff has been reduced from around 400 per cent to 12.5 per cent for non-agriculture products. Tariff reform for agriculture products has beenconstrained by the intransigence of developed countries in reducing their farmsubsidies. Internationally, India has always participated actively in WTOnegotiations. More recently, reflecting the hiccup in the achievement ofconsensus for further global trade reforms, India has also began to participatein  a  number of regional and bilateral trade agreements that are in themaking.With the change in the exchange rate regime and accomplishment oftrade reforms the current account is now open along with limited capitalaccount convertibility.  The exchange rate regime focuses on management ofvolatility without a fixed rate target and the underlying demand and supplyconditions determine the exchange rate movements in an orderly way.Micro Economic ReformsLet me now turn to the micro economic reforms. Industrial deregulation,infrastructure reforms, financial sector strengthening, capital marketdeepening and agriculture are the major areas where such reforms havetaken place.Industrial PolicyMassive deregulation of the industrial sector, in fact, constituted thefirst major package of reforms in July 1991.  The obsolete system of capacitylicensing of industries was discontinued; the existing legislative restrictions onthe expansion of large companies were removed; phased manufacturingprogrammes were terminated; and the reservation of many basic industriesfor investment only by the public sector was removed.  At the same timerestrictions that existed on the import of foreign technology were withdrawn,and a new regime welcoming foreign direct investment, hitherto discouragedwith limits on foreign ownership, was introduced.  With this massive reformintroduced in one stroke in 1991, the stage was set for a policy framework thatencouraged new entry, introduced new competition, both domestic andforeign, which thereby induced the attainment of much greater efficiency inindustry over a period of time.  One area of industrial reform that has beensluggish has been the removal of restrictions that exist on investment in mostlabour using industries – known as small scale industry reservations.  In 1991as many as 836 industries were reserved for investment by only small firms,defined by the level of investment.  The number of these industries has nowcome down to 326.4InfrastructureA number of measures have been initiated in the development ofinfrastructure since 1996. Many of these reforms emanated from therecommendations of the India Infrastructure Report of the mid 1990s. Werecognized that infrastructure investment had to be raised and suggestedintroduction of the private sector in infrastructure which had been restrictedearlier.  This was part of a world wide move during the 1990s.  This has alsonecessitated other wide ranging reforms including new legislations andformation of regulatory authorities.With deregulation, introduction of the private sector and formation ofthe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), telecom is indeed asuccess story. The major reforms in roadways were: imposition of a fuel cessto finance highway construction; the commissioning of the National HighwayDevelopment Project and PMGSY (Prime Minister's Gram Sadak Yojana orthe Rural Roads Programme). In case of ports private operators have beenintroduced and then the Tariff Authority of Major Ports (TAMP) formed; in civilaviation new private airlines, new private airports and the beginning of anopen skies policy are in evidence. In all these cases the response has beenpositive.In other infrastructure sectors, the reform process experience has beenmixed. In the power sector, where some of the early efforts for reform weremade in the early 1990s, problems continue to constrain its expansion. Acomprehensive modern electricity act has been enacted, which has enablingfeatures for encouraging private sector entry, enhanced competition, andrational regulation. However, despite the formation of a central regulatoryauthority and others at the state level, implementation of the tariff reform hasnot been found to be easy. State Electricity Boards continue to suffer fromlosses, arising both from inadequate tariff and from transmission anddistribution losses (comprising important part of theft). Consequently, privatesector investors in power generation face insecurity of payment and henceexpansion of private investment in this sector has been constrained. Althoughthe Act allows for private participation in distribution, practically it has not beenfound easy to privatize distribution systems. Thus, power reforms have someway to go, although the legislative and institutional pre-requisites are now inplace.Urban infrastructure is another area where reform has been inadequateand thinking has just begun. In transportation, considerable reforms havetaken place in air and road transportation but railways have some way to go.Although there has been noted improvement in financial performance ofrailways in the last couple of years, there is need for much greater structuralreforms for this vital transportation system to be put in a sound sustainedgrowth path.Financial SectorFinancial sector reform is another area of India's success story.   Amajor element of the financial sector reform was the introduction of5competition enhancing measures. Introduction of operational autonomy andpartial disinvestment of public ownership in public sector banks, entry of newprivate and foreign banks and permission for FDI and portfolio investment inbanking are some the major reform measures in this area. Listing of almost allpublic sector banks is another major reform in this regard. Besides, prudentialregulations have been strengthened in line with Basel I standards and arenow in process of being updated to Basel II standards. An effort has been putin for phased implementation of international best practices such as, CRAR,provisioning and income recognition norms, exposure limits and measures tostrengthen risk management.The introduction of partial private sector ownership in public sectorbanks and their consequent listing has been extremely important for marketorientation of these banks and transparency in their accounts and operations.This gradual process of banking sector reforms has contributed significantly tothe all round improvement in the financial health of the banking system.Among other segments of the financial sector, new private insurancecompanies have been introduced with limited foreign ownership.  Subsequentto insurance nationalization in the 1950s and 1960s, all insurance was in thepublic sector, with just one life insurance company and four general insurancecompanies.  The introduction of new competition has led to the introduction ofnew products and new practices.  A new regulator, the Insurance Regulationand Development Authority (IRDA) has been formed to govern the insuranceindustry.The capital market has been revived with both policy reforms andfinancial infrastructure development.  The Securities and Exchange Board ofIndia was formed as the capital market regulator; a new modern technologyoriented stock exchange was formed (the National Stock Exchange, NSE);private sector mutual funds allowed and encouraged; along with the abolitionof the Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) who controlled both issuance ofsecurities and administered their price.  A particular development has beenthe building of world class payment and settlement architecture in the stockmarket and government securities market.  The one area that still needsconsiderable attention and development is the corporate bond market.AgricultureAgriculture is the key significant area that has not been subject tocomprehensive reforms.  It is not widely understood, though, that thereduction of industrial tariffs improved the domestic terms of trade significantlyfor agriculture.  In terms of trade reforms in agriculture, these have beenconstrained by the lack of progress in the WTO and the intransigence ofdeveloped countries in the reduction of their farm subsidies.  There have,however, been a number of significant reforms: removal of restraints on interstate movement of foodgrains; the restructuring of the public distributionsystem (PDS); relaxation of restrictions under the Essential Commodities Act;introduction of forward trading in most agricultural commodities; and removalof some marketing restrictions on crop produce.  There is no doubt, however,6that agricultural development needs much more focused attention in order torevive the somewhat stagnating agricultural economy.Having given a bird's eye view of the reforms measures let me nowturn to the outcome of this whole wide ranging reform process.II. Where are We?There is a need to remember where India was at the time of itsindependence. Power capacity was just 1.1 per cent of what it is now.  Thecountry was literally in darkness!  With high mortality rates, the average Indiandied at age 32. More than half of the country was under the poverty line.   Theincome of an average household is now nearly Rs.130,000. Poverty wasdown to 23-26 per cent in 1999-2000.  Per capita growth has gone up fromabout 1.5 per cent per year in the first 30 years after independence to about6.4 per cent per year now.  This makes a palpable difference in peoples'standard of living (Tables 1, 2 and 3).Table 1: Select Indicators of India's ProgressYear Per Capita Poverty Literacy Life PowerIncome (Per cent) (Per Expectancy Capacity(at 1993- cent) (Years) (MW)94 prices)(Rs)1951 3,687 45 18 32 1,3621961 4,429 45 28 41 4,6531971 5,002 52 34 46 14,7091981 5,352 43 44 50 30,2141991 7,321 35 52 59 64,0002001 10,308 26 65 65 102,0002005 12,414 19.3* .. .. 118,419 * Projection for 20077Table 2: Indian Growth Experience(Per cent)Sector Agriculture Industry Services GDP PerCapitaNationalIncome1951-52 3.1 6.1 4.6 3.9 1.9to 1960-611961-62 2.5 5.4 4.9 3.7 1.3to 1970-711971-72 1.8 4.4 4.2 3.2 0.8to 1980-811981-82 3.1 7.6 6.7 5.6 3.2to 1990-91Crisis -1.5 -1.2 4.5 1.3 -1.5Year:1991-921992-93 3.4 6.1 7.7 6.1 4.1to 2001-02*2002-03 1.9 8.3 8.7 7.0 5.6to 2005-06** Data up to 1999-2000 are at the base year 1993-94 and data from 2000-01onwards are at the base  year 1999-2000 Source: Central Statistical OrganisationTable 3: Percentage of People below Poverty Line(Per cent) 1987-88 1993-94 1999-2000 Projection for2007Rural 39.1 37.3 27.1 21.1Urban 38.2 32.4 23.6 15.1Source: Economic Survey 2002-03Having outlined the major elements of India's achievement sinceindependence let me briefly review the broad trends in various macro-policyvariables.The step-up in the growth rate of the economy has been facilitated byincrease in domestic investment to over 30 per cent of GDP, financedpredominantly by domestic savings. Domestic savings increased to over 29per cent of GDP by 2004-05 after some stagnation in the second half of the81990s. The improvement in overall savings in recent years has particularlybenefited from the turnaround in public sector savings. After turning negativebetween 1998-99 and 2002-03 owing to sharp deterioration in the savings ofGovernment administration, public sector savings have turned positive againfrom 2003-04 onwards, mainly reflecting the ongoing fiscal consolidation. In2004-05, the public sector savings rate was 2.2 per cent, but it was still lessthan a half of the peak of almost five per cent touched in 1976-77.Improvement in corporate profitability since 2002-03 has also contributed toincrease in domestic savings in the recent years. Household savings remainthe predominant component of domestic savings, contributing almost three-fourths of overall domestic savings in 2004-05. For the Indian economy toachieve higher growth on a sustained basis, further improvement in overallsavings is necessary and, in this context, public sector savings will have toplay a significant role (Table 4).Table 4:  Aggregate and Public Sector Savings and Investment(As percentage of GDP)Year Aggregate Public SectorSavings Investment Savings Investment1980-81 18.9 20.3 3.4 8.41981-82 18.6 20.1 4.5 10.11982-83 18.3 19.6 4.3 10.71983-84 17.6 18.7 3.3 9.71984-85 18.8 20.1 2.8 10.41985-86 19.5 21.7 3.2 10.81986-87 18.9 21.0 2.7 11.21987-88 20.6 22.5 2.2 9.51988-89 20.9 23.8 2.1 9.51989-90 22.0 24.5 1.7 9.51990-91 23.1 26.3 1.1 9.31991-92 22.0 22.6 2.0 8.81992-93 21.8 23.6 1.6 8.61993-94 22.5 23.1 0.6 8.21994-95 24.8 26.0 1.7 8.71995-96 25.1 26.9 2.0 7.71996-97 23.2 24.5 1.7 7.01997-98 23.1 24.6 1.3 6.61998-99 21.5 22.6 -1.0 6.61999-00 24.9 26.0 -0.9 7.52000-01 23.5 24.2 -1.8 6.92001-02 23.6 23.0 -2.0 6.92002-03 26.5 25.3 -0.7 6.22003-04 28.9 27.2 1.0 6.52004-05 29.1 30.1 2.2 7.2Source: National Accounts Statistics, Central Statistical Organisation9Fiscal performance has still some way to go.  The gross fiscal deficithas come down from 7 per cent in 1993-94 to 4.1 per cent in 2005-06.However, this needs to go to 3 per cent by 2009.  Tax Revenue has justrecovered to 10 per cent of GDP, about the 1991-92 level, and needs muchgreater growth (Table 5).  Inflation is down from the 45 year average of 7 - 8per cent to 4.5 - 5.0 per cent. So we have achieved some major macro andmonetary improvements. However, growth needs investment and savings.Although the growth process stuttered somewhat in the late 1990s and earlypart of this decade, it has clearly recovered now and we seem to be on asustainable path of annual GDP growth in excess of 8 per cent.  After theaward of the Pay Commission in 1997, public finances had come under strainand hence public savings had become negative.  This was also accompaniedby a business cycle slowdown and low profitability in the private corporatesector and low corporate savings.  Both recoveries have now taken place:public sector savings are now again positive; and corporate profitability is alsovery healthy.  With continuing growth in household savings, gross domesticsavings are now 30 per cent plus and hence sustained investment rates inexcess of 32 per cent are feasible.  The sustenance of a higher growth nowneeds improvement in public investment and delivery of public services.Table 5: Select Fiscal Indicators of the Central Government (As percentage to GDP) Gross Revenu Direc Indirec Gros Interest SubsidieFiscal e Deficit t t s payment sDeficit Taxe Taxes Tax ss1991-92 5.6 2.5 2.3 8.0 10.3 4.1 1.91992-93 5.4 2.5 2.4 7.5 10.0 4.2 1.41993-94 7.0 3.8 2.4 6.5 8.8 4.3 1.41994-95 5.7 3.1 2.7 6.5 9.1 4.4 1.21995-96 5.1 2.5 2.8 6.5 9.4 4.2 1.11996-97 4.9 2.4 2.8 6.6 9.4 4.3 1.11997-98 5.8 3.1 3.2 6.0 9.1 4.3 1.21998-99 6.5 3.8 2.7 5.6 8.3 4.5 1.41999-00 5.3 3.5 3.0 5.8 8.8 4.6 1.32000-01 5.6 4.0 3.2 5.7 8.9 4.7 1.32001-02 6.2 4.4 3.0 5.2 8.2 4.7 1.42002-03 5.9 4.4 3.4 5.4 8.8 4.8 1.82003-04 4.5 3.6 3.8 5.4 9.2 4.5 1.62004-05 4.0 2.5 4.3 5.5 9.8 4.1 1.42005-06 4.1 2.7 4.7 5.7 10.4 3.7 1.42006-07 3.8 2.1 5.3 5.9 11.2 3.5 1.2(BE)10BE: Budget EstimateFinancial sector reforms in general and banking reforms in particular1have been a key ingredient of the Indian reforms process. As a result ofthese reforms, statutory pre-emptions of banks (in the form of high cashreserve and statutory liquidity ratio) got reduced to a great extent - so was theextent of financial repression. Interestingly the asset quality of the Indianbanks has improved to a great extent with a distinct improvement in capital-to-risk adjusted assets ratio (CRAR) of banks which is much above thestipulated level (9 per cent), and drastic reduction in NPA levels,notwithstanding the transition to 90-day delinquency norm in 2004 (Table 6).The initial recapitalization by government in the public sector banks has beenrather meagre (about 1 per cent of GDP) which was supported by equityissuance by the public sector banks. With public listing the public sector banksin India are now more subject to market discipline. Furthermore, there hasbeen a distinct improvement in post-reform productivity as reflected in variousindicators such as, business per employee, profit per employee and branchproductivity. These productivity gains can be attributed to both technologicalimprovement as well as peer pressure or catching up effect.Table 6: Indicators of Indian Banking Reforms(Per cent)Extent of Competition(Percentage share in Total BankQuality of Assets Assets)Private PublicGross NPL Net NPL Foreign Sector Sector/ Assets / Assets Banks Banks Banks1996-97 7.0 3.3 7.9 7.7 84.42000-01 4.9 2.5 7.9 12.6 79.52002-03 4.0 1.8 6.9 17.5 75.72003-04 3.3 1.2 6.9 18.6 74.52004-05 2.5 0.9 6.5 18.2 75.32005-06 1.9 0.7 7.2 20.4 72.3Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaLet me briefly touch on the external sector now. The measures taken inrespect of the external sector have clearly been very successful.Merchandise exports have increased from 6 to 13 per cent of GDP between1990-91 and 2005-06; imports have also increased from 10 to 24 per cent ofGDP over the same period; foreign exchange reserves increased from $ 1.5billion to $ 165 billion.                                                1 I have discussed the contours of Indian financial sector elsewhere; see Mohan, Rakesh (2004):"Financial Sector Reforms and Monetary Policy: The Indian Experience", RBI Bulletin, October 2004.11Industrial growth was very high during the 1992-97 period in theimmediate exuberance of industrial policy reforms.  However, there was asignificant slowdown during 1997-2002. As tariffs were reduced, importcontrols were lifted, and domestic competitive threats emerged at the sametime, the initial protective effects of the ex ante real devaluation of 1991 woreoff and the Indian corporate sector, particularly in manufacturing, found itselfin difficulty.  The Indian corporate sector was therefore in the throes ofsignificant technical restructuring, business process restructuring and financialrestructuring, all at the same time.  It can be said in retrospect that, thoughthis process resulted in an industrial slowdown then, it has contributed to theindustrial competitive resurgence that is now observed.  There is a revival ofmanufacturing. A competitive company can be found in almost every sectorindustrial sector now. As indicators of this competitiveness, exports aregrowing more than 20 per cent; and the balance of payments with referenceto China is almost even (Table 7).12Table 7: Some Indicators of India's Openness(Per cent of GDP) Exp Imp Expo Impor Recei Paym Curre Curre Curreort ort rts of t of pts of ents nt nt ntof of Servi Servi Transf of Recei Paym AccoGoo Goo ces ces ers & Transf pts ents untds ds Incom ers & Balanes Incom cees1990 5.8 8.8 1.4 1.1 0.9 1.3 8.2 11.2 -3.1-911991 6.9 7.9 1.9 1.4 1.7 1.5 10.5 10.8 -0.3-921992 7.3 9.6 1.8 1.5 1.8 1.5 10.9 12.6 -1.7-931993 8.3 9.8 1.9 1.7 2.2 1.3 12.4 12.8 -0.4-941994 8.3 11.1 1.9 1.7 2.9 1.3 13.1 14.2 -1.0-951995 9.1 12.3 2.1 2.1 2.9 1.3 14.1 15.8 -1.7-961996 8.9 12.7 1.9 1.8 3.6 1.2 14.4 15.6 -1.2-971997 8.7 12.5 2.3 2.0 3.4 1.3 14.4 15.8 -1.4-981998 8.3 11.5 3.2 2.7 3.0 1.3 14.5 15.5 -1.0-991999 8.3 12.3 3.5 2.6 3.2 1.2 15.0 16.1 -1.0-002000 9.9 12.6 3.5 3.2 3.5 1.7 16.9 17.4 -0.6-012001 9.4 11.8 3.6 2.9 4.1 1.7 17.0 16.3 0.7-022002 10.6 12.7 4.1 3.4 4.2 1.5 18.9 17.6 1.3-032003 11.0 13.3 4.5 2.8 4.4 1.5 19.9 17.6 2.3-042004 12.2 17.1 6.2 4.0 3.8 1.5 22.2 22.6 -0.4-052005 13.1 19.6 7.6 4.8 3.9 1.5 24.6 26.0 -1.3-06Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaThe performance of the Indian corporate sector has been highlyencouraging in the last three years. The previous occasion, when such ahealthy performance was demonstrated by the corporate sector was in theearly 1990s, i.e., during the initial period of exuberance immediately after the13economic reforms programme was initiated in India. But during the latter partof the 1990s, around 1997, the momentum in the corporate sector sloweddown in sync with the general economic slowdown. The recovery since then isremarkable in all important parameters: sales, gross profit, profit after tax, allhave recorded robust growth rates during 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05implying that economic activity in the corporate sector has taken a full circleafter three years of dull performance during 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02(Table 8).The current exuberant run of corporate sector performance hascontinued well into its fourth year as evidenced by the corporate sector resultsfor the first quarter of 2006-07. The strong sales performance has resulted inan improved bottom-line for the corporate sector as a whole. Powered by astrong top-line performance, gross profits of the Indian corporate sector grewat a sturdy rate of 34 per cent in the quarter ending in June 2006 on top of a20 per cent growth recorded in the full fiscal year of 2005-06. The interestcosts have been plummeting in the recent years due to an overall softening ofinterest rates and lower debt equity ratios, which is an outcome of consciouspolicy-driven measures.Table 8: Select Indicators of Corporate Performance(Per cent)Sales Growth PAT Growth Working Capital / Debt / Sales(Year-on-Year) (Year-on-Year) Sales1995-95 29.9 55.4 52.2 50.81995-96 19.4 22.7 53.2 47.71996-97 19.3 -0.5 54.8 47.81997-98 6.1 13.5 51.9 49.61998-99 13.8 -2.8 50.0 43.81999-2000 21.6 9.2 47.6 37.82000-01 22.9 23.6 42.2 31.82001-02 3.7 0.2 41.1 31.32002-03 16.2 51.8 43.2 27.12003-04 13.0 30.7 39.5 25.02004-05 18.5 28.4 24.7 52.6Source: Prowess, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.There is in fact a new confidence in the air. Let me give some randomillustrations - TISCO is the lowest cost steel producer, Hindalco / Sterlite /NALCO are competitive aluminum producer, Reliance is a majorpetrochemical producer. We now have world class producers in most sectorsand there are many more success stories. Moser Baer exports more thanRs.1000 crore; Hero Honda with 1.7 million motor cycles is the largestproducer of motor cycles; one now gets a wide range of automobiles in Indiasuch as Maruti, Tata, Hyundai, Toyota, GM, Ford; in Pharma there areRanbaxy and Dr Reddy’s among others; Bharat Forge exports castings and14forgings to all main auto producers; Sundaram Clayton has been adjudged asBest GM supplier.Let me sum up the broad contours of success of the overall economicreform programme.  In general, the reform programme has achievedremarkable success.  Annual GDP growth has averaged 6 to 6.5 per centduring the whole 15 year period since reforms began, and is now ascendingto a higher trajectory of 8 per cent plus sustained growth.  The external sectoris comfortable: gone are the days of perpetual “shortage” of foreign exchange.In contrast, some observers view India’s foreign exchange as reserves as aproblem of plenty.  Industrial growth has been restored and the manufacturingsector has found a new level of competitiveness, quality and efficiency.  Thereis a transformation in the external impression of the Indian economy: it is nowviewed with a sense of some awe and confidence in its potential ofsustainable high growth.  Finally, measured poverty has been reducedsignificantly.But we still have miles to go.  The poverty ratio of 23-26 per cent is stilltoo high, about a quarter billion people living in poverty are too many.Employment growth is inadequate and we have an expanding young labourforce, which will demand quality jobs.  Public service delivery continues to bepoor, with little sign of improvement.Let me now turn to a menu of things that we need to do.III. Where Do We Go?We have now had 15 years of economic reforms spanning fivegovernments.  What have these reforms achieved?  We have ascended ahigher growth path; poverty has been reduced; the external sector is morethan comfortable; industrial growth has been restored; and all this has beenachieved with financial stability in the country.  As a consequence of all thesemomentous changes there is a new respect for India in the world and, evenmore important, Indians in all walks of life have found a new level of selfconfidence.But we still have miles to go.  We need to move to the next level ofsustained growth so that per capita income growth can exceed seven per centper annum (or over 8.5 per cent per GDP growth per annum on a sustainedbasis) and thereby see at least a doubling every decade.  Although povertyhas been reduced considerably to less than 25 per cent, this level is still toohigh with 250 million living under the defined poverty line, which itself is at avery low level.The main organizing principle of most reforms carried out so far hasbeen that of freeing the private sector from the myriad government controlsthat had existed for a long time.  Whereas this process itself still has somedistance to go, the consequence of this widespread deregulation andintroduction of competition in most segments of the economic sphere hasbeen the very visible unleashing of entrepreneurial energies at all levels andin most parts of the country.  We have been reasonably successful in what we15set out to do so far, with the benefits of increased competition and efficiencymanifesting themselves in the higher recorded growth, particularly in thepresent decade.The issue that arises now is whether we have reached the limit ofprivate sector led acceleration in investment and output growth?  Will this nowbe increasingly constrained by the lack of public investment, both physicaland social? An underlying theme encompassing most constraints now is thelack of adequate delivery of public services in both quality and quantity. Thepublic service system is simply not functioning.Further acceleration in economic growth and reduction of poverty willneed greater investment and employment growth along with enhancement ofproductivity.  For such acceleration to take place we will need a significantenhancement of growth in capacity building and in the availability of publicservices that the private sector cannot provide.I, therefore, believe that just as the first generation of reformsempowered the private sector to perform as it can to the limits of its abilities,the second generation of economic reforms must focus on a similarempowerment of the public sector to deliver public goods and services for thebenefit of all segments of the private sector, corporate entities and the publicalike.  Lest this proposition be misunderstood, it should be made clear that Iam not advocating greater empowerment of the public sector to increase itscontrol over the economy as was the case in the past.  The “public sector”needs to be seen in its widest definition to encompass all levels ofgovernments from the local, state to national, and their entities, which deliverpublic goods and services.I would like to take up four areas, by way of illustration, where we needto give focused attention and which I believe can mainly be done by the publicsector, even if some of it is to be delivered through public private partnership.The four areas that I propose to address are: agricultural development,urban development, human resource development, management of publicservices.What is commo0n among these sectors is the lack of competence inpublic systems that govern these areas. There are other areas of broadergovernance that could also be taken up, particularly the maintenance of lawand order, but that would take me too far a field from my area of competencerelated to the economy.AgricultureOne of the most disturbing features of the recent growth experiencehas been that of the deceleration in agriculture growth (Table 9).16Table 9: Growth in Agricultural Production and Value Added(Per cent)Period GDP in GDP in Agriculture Index of AgricultureAgriculture and Allied Activities Production1950s 3.0 2.7 3.71950s 2.5 2.5 2.91970s 1.4 1.3 1.41980s 4.7 4.4 5.21990s 3.1 3.0 2.32000s 2.0 @ 2.3 $ -1.6 #@:For 2000-01 to 2004-05 as per the new series (Base: 1999-2000=100).$: For 2000-01 to 2005-06.#: Index of Agriculture Production (Base: Triennium Ending 1981-82=100)covers the period 2000-01 to 2004-05.Source: 1) National Accounts Statistics.             2) Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India.With about 60 per cent of the population still largely dependent onagriculture, this deceleration has clearly had a significant impact on slowerreduction in poverty levels than otherwise would have been the case.Moreover, for aggregate annual GDP growth to exceed 8.5 per cent on asustainable basis it will be difficult if agricultural growth itself does not exceed4 per cent annual growth.  The fast growing economies of East and South-East Asia all exhibited elevated levels of agriculture growth along withindustrial and service sector growth during their fast growth periods.   Higheragriculture growth will also lead to faster increases in rural household incomesgiving rise to greater demand for goods and services in rural and urban areasalike, which would be employment promoting.In order to understand where the potential for higher agriculture growthmay lie, it is useful to briefly examine the pattern of growth in both the demandfor and supply of agricultural commodities.Let us take the supply side first.  After the prolonged drought of the mid1960s, and the severe difficulties experienced in food security during thatperiod, the government launched a crash emergency programme toaccelerate the production of basic foodgrain cereals.  This was fortunatelyaccompanied by the discovery of high yield rice and wheat varietiesinternationally, which made the green revolution possible.  Thus, growth inrice and wheat production took place in a sustained fashion through bothsignificant productivity gains and through expansion in the area devoted tocereal production.  The successful evolution of the Green Revolution gave thecountry both agriculture growth and food security over a period of more thantwo and a half decades.  In recent years, however, production growth incereals has stagnated significantly, and further productivity gains areincreasingly difficult to achieve.Equally significant change can be observed on the demand side.  Asmay be expected, with increasing incomes, there has been a progressivediversification of the Indian diet in both rural and urban areas involving a shift17away from cereals to non-cereals.  For the poorest, of course, the initialincrease in incomes leads to enhanced demand for food and a shift fromlower quality cereals to higher quality cereals like wheat and rice.  As incomesincrease further, greater growth takes place in the demand for non-cerealfoods such as milk, fruits and vegetables, and for fish, poultry and meat forthose who are not vegetarians.  Consequently, it needs to be understood that,whereas there may be technological limitations to the continued growth ofcereal production from the supply side, there are also limitations to thecontinued growth of cereals from the demand side.  Admittedly, the shift todemand for certain kinds of meat will lead to acceleration in the demand forcertain kinds of feed stocks for animal production.  Nonetheless, the key pointfor policy is that the acceleration in agriculture production cannot come fromthat of cereals, keeping both demand and supply constraints in mind.  Thatbeing said it still needs to be emphasized that the serious stagnation incereals production that has taken place in the last ten years or so needs to beaddressed with urgency.What then needs to be done?  We can learn from the approach takenmore than thirty years ago, which still dominates our policy thinking.  Thesuccess of the green revolution was achieved by the adoption of acoordinated policy package that addressed the needs of production on anational scale.  Simultaneous provision was made for the supply of neededtechnology inputs, infrastructure, input supplies and the delivery of credit in atimely fashion.  Technology inputs were provided by the setting up of a chainof agricultural universities across the country, which, moreover, were alsoconnected with the international agricultural research system and foreigncounterpart agricultural universities, particularly the land grant colleges anduniversities of the United States.  For the transfer of technology from thelaboratory to the farm, agricultural extension systems were organized, firstunder the Intensive Agriculture Districts Programme (IADP) and later theIntensive Agriculture Area Programme (IAAP).  For a considerable period oftime both the research and extension systems proved to be quite effective,but deteriorated later.  Infrastructure provision was essentially needed for theexpansion of irrigation from ground water sources, which required the greateravailability of electric power to energize pump sets.  Consequently a largerural electrification programme was initiated along with the provision of powerfor agriculture at subsidized rates.  The main new inputs needed were seeds,fertilizers, pump-sets, and tractors.  Apart from the arrangement of supply ofthese inputs, corresponding arrangements were made for appropriate creditdelivery to farmers to enable them to buy these inputs.  The nationalization ofbanks, the creation of regional rural banks, and the creation of National Bankfor Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to govern the ruralcooperative banks were all directed towards this massive change in thedelivery of credit to fuel the green revolution.  Most of these activities weredone on a national basis with appropriate coordination with state governmentsand other public sector agencies.  Given the highest priority that was attachedto this programme, it delivered.18Need for a Second Green RevolutionThe need now is for a corresponding second agricultural revolution, butone that will have to be much more heterogeneous.  With the increasingdiversification of the Indian diet, there is great potential for acceleration ofgrowth in the production of all non cereal foods, though in varying degrees.There is need for a new agricultural revolution in all areas such as: dairying,horticulture (covering both fruits and vegetables), aquaculture and pisci-culture, poultry, meat, and even wineries. There is also similar potential foracceleration in growth in non-food agriculture. The potential in all these areasis massive for income and employment generation on a well distributed basis;for generation of a host of new activities; and for widespread innovation.How can this be achieved?  A key common feature behind the successof the national programme related to both the green revolution and the whiterevolution (milk production) was the relatively homogeneous nature of cerealproduction and of milk.  It was thus possible to design national programmesthat were broadly applicable country wide with relatively easy regionalvariations.  The difficulty in designing programmes for the new agriculturalactivities is that these products are very heterogeneous and which, moreover,exhibit great regional differences.Even for each activity, say poultry production, it will be difficult todesign the kind of national programmes that helped the green and whiterevolutions.  The need is now for decentralized packages for the manydifferent activities that will have to be regionally disaggregated.  The broadapproach can be similar. Each package will need to make simultaneousprovision for technology inputs, infrastructure, supply of inputs and associatedcredit delivery.  Whereas the packages will need to be diverse anddecentralized,   it is unlikely that they will be developed without the initiation ofa nationwide coordinated programme on a mission basis.  Such a programmecould form expert teams for each activity and location.  It will be essential tobring together high level expertise, both domestic and international, along withlocal practitioners.  Each team would prepare a package for their respectiveactivities and locations.  There is now much more expertise available acrossthe country relative to the situation 35 years ago.Along with such a disaggregated but coordinated programmes, there isneed for a major new initiative for the rejuvenation of agricultural research thatis also regionally distributed.  A crash programme is required for the urgentrenovation of agricultural universities, which will need to be supportedinternationally as well.  A beginning has already been made by the PrimeMinister’s initiative to renew association with the US research system.  Theseuniversities need to be made respectable again.  They will also need tospecialize in the activities specific to their locations.  The transfer oftechnology from these rejuvenated universities and from other sources willalso have to be specific to each activity and new forms of extension activitywill need to be explored to achieve the maximum effectiveness.  There isincreasing expertise in the private sector and in the cooperative sector so newforms of public private partnerships will have to be explored, just as theNational Dairy Development Board innovated in respect of milk.19The banking system will also have to explore ways and means ofachieving efficient credit delivery to these new agricultural activities along withall their associated activities.  As the system develops, the supply chain fromfarm to market will need to be financed: warehouses, cold storages, ruraltransportation, refrigerated trucks, along with all the service intermediaries.The efficient delivery of credit in a dispersed manner in rural areas will need togive special attention to the minimization of transaction costs throughreduction in layering of intermediaries, much greater use of informationtechnology in information collection, risk assessment and risk monitoring.Clearly, a great degree of innovation is called for now with out of the boxthinking, away from the past paradigm of directed credit.Finally, agricultural diversification and growth is not possible withoutthe provision of rural infrastructure: roads, storage facilities, transportation,telecommunication and power.  All of these activities have very high economicreturns but, those that have public good characteristics have low financialreturns.  They are therefore difficult to finance.  User charges will have to beused where feasible, but other financing means will need to explored.  Stateslike Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Goa built rural roads early andfinanced them through the imposition of local cesses like the Mandi cess.Hence there is clear need for the search for new financing mechanisms.Investment in and the financing of rural infrastructure is therefore a keychallenge.  The government has clearly recognized this through the initiationof Bharat Nirman and PURA.I have digressed at some length on the need for acceleratingagricultural growth and how it could possibly be done because of its obviousimportance and its relative neglect over the past 15 years.  The key point thatI would like to emphasize here is that without the organizing and coordinatinginitiative of the government and its agencies at various levels, such aprogramme cannot be implemented.  It is in this context that I have talkedabout the empowerment of the public sector in all its aspects, but particularlyrelated to competence.Urbanisation and Urban DevelopmentLet me now move to issues related to urbanization and urbandevelopment.  It may be ironic but, just as agricultural growth has stagnated inrecent years, the astonishing fact is that urban population growth also sloweddown in India during the 1980s and 1990s (Table 9).  The normal expectationis, and the historical experience is that urban growth normally accelerates witheconomic growth.  So the slowing of Indian urbanization is unexpected,perhaps anomalous, and worrisome. At the same time, the magnitude ofIndia’s urban population is large, about 300 million people, similar inmagnitude to the total population of the United States.  Even with low growth itwill probably double by 2030 or so.  According to most projections done in the1980s the urban population in 2001 was expected to be about 30 to 35 millionhigher than the estimated 285 million.  Contrary to popular impression, therehas been a significant slowdown in net rural urban migration: people are notflowing into cities and there is no “urban explosion”.  During the whole decadeof 1981 to 1991, total net rural-urban migration was only 12.7 million people20and 14.4 million in the following decade of 1991-2001. In both decades, netrural urban migration accounted for only 21 per cent of total urban populationgrowth.Why is this worrisome and why has this strange occurrence takenplace in India?In the light of low growth in agricultural production and productivity, hadthere been a greater rural/urban transformation, outward migration from ruralto urban areas would have relieved some of the economic pressure in ruralareas.  Ironically, this in itself is also related to the inadequate increase inrural productivity.  Had there been greater increases in rural productivity, ruralincomes would have increased faster, leading to higher growth in the demandfor non-food goods, leading to higher industrialization and urbanization.  Withhigher productivity, more food could also have been produced by fewerpeople and hence more people would have been released off the land.  Thesecond issue relates to the atypically low growth in manufacturingemployment: during the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, output growth inindustry far exceeded that in employment.  This experience is also quitedifferent from that of the East and South-East Asian countries.  Thus, therehave been neither demand pressures for labour in urban areas, nor supply ofexcess labour from rural areas.  Both are related to failures in both publicpolicy and public administration and public management.  Just as we have notresponded to the changing contours of agriculture, the low absorption oflabour in urban areas is related to inappropriate industrial and urban policies.Table 9: Urban Population in India, 1901-2001Census Number Total Rural Urban Average UrbanYear of Populatio Populatio Populatio AnnualPopulation asUAs/ n n n Growth inpercentage ofTowns (in (in (in Urban totalmillions) millions) millions) Population Population1901 1,830 238 213 26 .. 10.81911 1,815 252 226 26 0.00 10.31921 1,944 251 223 28 0.77 11.21931 2,066 279 246 34 2.14 12.01941 2,253 319 275 44 2.94 13.91951 2,822 361 299 62 4.09 17.31961 2,334 439 360 79 2.74 18.01971 2,567 548 439 109 3.80 19.91981 3,347 683 524 160 4.68 23.31991 3,769 846 629 218 3.63 25.72001 4,378 1,027 742 285 3.07 27.8Note:1.

The total population and urban population of India for the year 1981includes interpolated population of Assam where the census could not beconductedSource: Census of India, 2001The persistence of industrial policies, such as restrictions in manylabour using manufacturing sectors being reserved for small scale industries,and rigidities in labour legislations, have contributed to the bias against labourusing industrialization. Such policies were further compounded byinappropriate industrial location policies that have restricted location ofindustries in cities and urban areas since the 1970s.  Such restrictions haveled to the loss of agglomeration economies, thereby raising the cost ofindustrialization and hence inhibiting expansion.  Moreover, the role of citiesas incubators for manufacturing entrepreneurship was not also allowed toflourish; and finally it is labour using industries that need to be located in citiesand urban areas.  The necessity to locate in distant locations, where labour isnot easily available, also inhibited labour using industrialization, and henceurbanization.Another set of reasons why urban growth slowed in the 1980s and1990s is connected with the extant rigidities in urban land policy.  Theexistence of rent control laws since the 1940s, urban land ceiling laws sincethe 1970s, inappropriate zoning and building bye-laws, have all contributed tothe inflexibility in transformation of land use in urban areas, thereby slowingurban growth.  These rigidities also implied excessive government control ofurban land development, which was handicapped further by lack of resourcesand expertise.  Thus land assembly and land development in Indian cities hasbeen handicapped generally and has also led to excessive increase in urbanland prices, making shelter unaffordable for a large proportion of the people.These policy rigidities have been further compounded by inadequateurban infrastructure investment and severe problems in urban governance:urban local bodies have not been effective; they suffer both from lack ofexpertise and of financial resources.  Local taxes are typically not buoyantand poorly administered, and user charges are low and ineffective.The consequence is that most urban environments are inhospitable,particularly to the less well off.  This is indicated by the fact that about half ofurban households do not have access to drinking water within their house;and about a quarter of urban households do not have access to any latrine,private or public.  These messages have obviously gone back to the villageand it is no wonder that urban growth has slowed down.What is to be done? This is another case where the public sector hasto be empowered to make appropriate knowledge based policy that is city and22people friendly; and also to build capacity to manage cities in a progressiveframework. Overall industrial policy and industrial location policy both have tobe rid of their anti-labour using bias; and industrial location policy has toprovide for the conscious development of urban industrial parks.  Many Asiancities, for example, including a high income city state like Singapore, have aprofusion of flatted multi-storied factories that house a host of non-pollutinglabour using manufacturing facilities.   There has to be a recognition of thevirtue of industrial clusters and facilitation of associated facilities such asindustrial training institutions, educational and health facilities.  Many suchactivities can be supplied by the private sector but it is enlightened publicmanagement that can bring them about.We now have 35 million plus cities and about 400 cities with more than100,000 population. Thus, the management problem of these cities areimmense in terms of financial management, in the provision of public services,and overall city management.  The budgets of the largest cities are larger thanthose of some states.  Yet there are almost no programmes for the training ofcity managers, there is little expertise available, and the prestige of municipalemployees is low.  Once again there is a massive failure to provide for publicmanagement of cities in India in all its various manifestations.Hence strengthening of city management is a key requirement for thehealthy growth of Indian cities.  This needs a massive programme for financialstrengthening of local bodies including revamping of their local tax systems sothat they become buoyant.  Ways and means will also have to be found forcredit enhancement of urban local bodies so that they become credit worthyand can then raise the resources necessary for urban infrastructureinvestment.  Overall, cities are huge public management systems that havebeen largely neglected.With the opening of the Indian economy, Indian industry and enterpriseof all kinds have to be competitive with the best in the world.  They will behandicapped if the cities that they inhabit are themselves not as efficient astheir counterparts elsewhere.  Hence, the acceleration in growth of Indianenterprise will be constrained without adequate empowerment of the publicsector in terms of management of Indian cities.  This is a job that the privatesector clearly cannot do.Human Resource DevelopmentLet me now turn to human resource development.  It is ironic that wehave achieved great international recognition because of our achievements ininformation technology, which is often termed as the knowledge economy.We often believe that our comparative advantage is in knowledge intensivesectors.  In fact, given the basic indicators of health and education, it isdifficult to sustain the notion that we are a knowledge intensive country,notwithstanding the fact that we do have islands of excellence in variousareas (Table 10).Table 10: Select Parameters in Human Development Indices23 GDP Life Adult Infant Crude Access Improvper Expect Literac Mortali Birth to edcapita ancy y Rate ty Rate Clean Sanitat(PPP at (Perce (Per (per Water ionUS$) Birth ntage) 1000 1000 (per (per2003 (years) (Age births) people cent of cent of2003 15 and 2003 ) 2003 Popula Populaabove) tion) tion)2003 2002 20021.

Ifproductivity in agriculture is to improve, the basic education levels of the rurallabour force, both male and female will need to improve considerably.Similarly, if labour using Indian industry is to compete in the world, its labourforce also will have to be better educated and technically trained.  The futurewill essentially need a skilled labour force.Primary and Secondary EducationThat there is increasing appreciation of the education deficit in India isshown by the new programmes launched by the government for providing anew thrust to primary education: the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for AllProgramme).  There are also a host of non governmental and otherphilanthropic organizations now concentrating on the rapid expansion of24primary education in India.  However, it is now well known that there has beennoted deterioration in the public education systems in most parts of India.The performance of public primary schools has been widely brought intoquestion.  There is also increasing evidence of a shift from public to privateschools, even by the poor, and often their quality is no better.  What isencouraging is that with even poor parents spending a lot of money onprimary education, which should really be provided for by the state, there is aclear demand for it and recognition of its utility for upward mobility.  Theexpansion of government programmes will certainly expand the quantity ofeducation being offered.What needs equal attention, however, is the quality of education, whichwould emerge if there is greater local accountability of the school system andgreater local involvement in general.  Teachers themselves need to beincentivised and better trained; and teaching materials have to be providedand improved.  Clearly, these problems are the most pronounced in thepoorest parts of the country that are also underserved in terms of basicinfrastructure like power, rural roads and communications.  A great deal ofinnovation and experimentation is going on but much remains to be done.Whereas there should be no doubt that the state retains primary responsibilityfor ensuring primary education to all, there can be many different ways ofdelivering it, including the involvement of non government schools of differentdescriptions.As some success is achieved in the expansion of primary educationand reduction in drop out rates after primary schooling, the next thrust will bethe burgeoning demand for secondary education.  As we progress, incomesincrease and production processes need greater and greater skills to becompetitive, primary education will no longer be adequate for performinglower skill tasks.  Whereas there is considerable thinking going on withrespect to primary education, we haven’t even begun to think about theresources and strategy needed for the large consequent expansion ofsecondary schools.  We will need to expand the supply of secondary schoolteachers very significantly, invest large resources in school buildings and inthe preparation and distribution of education materials.  It is difficult to locatesecondary schools in each village: issues will also arise on how to make theseschools accessible to children in widely dispersed rural habitations.  Onceagain, great innovation is needed in thinking about how all this is to be done,and how the large resources needed will be generated and invested efficientlyand responsibly.Vocational TrainingWhat will these schools teach? Every educational system has had todeal with the tension between the need for basic secondary education andvocational training, and the difficulties involved in guiding childrenappropriately to the different streams.  Here again, there has been littleorganized thinking in India.  Technical training has essentially been providedby Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) but they are not many, and often do not25turn out students with the relevant skills.  It is interesting that in India there are175 defined trades that can be subject to organised training; in Germany thereare 2500 such defined trades and occupations, each with its organizedtraining syllabi, training certification, and availability of training institutions.The famed German vocational training system involves a very complex web ofinteraction between the federal government, state governments, localchambers of commerce, and firms that fund and take on the trainees.Whereas it would not be appropriate to suggest that India adopt the Germanmodel, which is itself undergoing change and modernization, I only mention itto suggest that it is possible to evolve an organized approach that makesvocational training respectable, demand oriented and with great localinvolvement and accountability.  A beginning has been made in seeking theupgradation of 500 ITIs with industry participation, but much more needs to bedone to ensure regular skill upgradation in all vocations.The effort will have to involve extensive industry participation at thelocal level so that the training imparted is seen as relevant by prospectiveemployers. As with the new requirements for agricultural extension systems,the systems for vocational training will need to have great heterogeneity inboth the kind of training to be imparted but also how the training to beorganised, accordingly to the different needs in the widely disparate regions ofIndia. We also need to recognise that service occupations need organisedtraining as well. One can illustrate this by the longtime recognition of trainingneeds in the hotel industry and how the private sector itself has set up a largenumber of excellent training institutions. Similar has been the case ininformation technology where many private sector training institutionsemerged as demand started rising. Hence this is clearly an area that is mostwell suited for public private partnerships. Once again, however, theorganisation of public private partnerships also involves a great deal oforganizational capacity in the public sector, which designs delivery systems in- a way that they spawn efficiency, productivity and innovation.Higher EducationLet me now move to issues related to higher education. There hasclearly been a huge increase in quantity since independence and in theproliferation of private sector technical institutions in recent years, particularlyin the Western and Southern regions of the country. However, the success ofa few elite institutions such as the Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institutesof Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), the NationalInstitute of Design, the more recent National Law Schools, have masked thegeneral lack of quality in Indian higher education. Even among the eliteinstitutions, only three were included in the top 500 higher educationinstitutions in the world as ranked on objective criteria by a group of Chineseresearchers. Because of the good quality of Indian secondary schooling on arelatively wider scale, competitive processes lead to the emergence of a largenumber of very bright Indian students who can then excel despite the poorquality of instruction and environment in higher educational institutions.Meanwhile, there has been an explosion of colleges and universities inEast and South East Asia, in China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and26Thailand in both quality and quantity. We must recognise urgently that there isgreat need to both improve the quality of our colleges and universities interms of facilities, laboratories, libraries, and most importantly, faculty - alongwith significant expansion of quantity. What should be clear is that the currentsystem will not do. Although a whole host of private technical institutions havemushroomed in recent years, most of the higher education system remainsgovernment controlled and run. This was originally modeled on the Britishpublic university system but which has, over the years, become ossified insuch a fashion that creativity and quality are at a premium.There is a severe shortage of resources: tuition fees are extremely lowand the government is strapped for resources. Moreover, there are legitimatecompeting claims for scarce resources for primary and secondary education,not to mention vocational education.Here also we need to search for new systems of governance that canallow for diversity in delivery. While providing appropriate incentives for theachievement of excellence with the great increase in compensation levels inthe private corporate sector, and the lack of even basic facilities in collegesand universities, attracting brighter students to take up teaching careers hasbecome even more difficult than it was hitherto.There is, to my mind, some needless debate on private versus publiceducation. No good higher educational institutions in the world are profitoriented. Even in the U.S., where there is perhaps the greatest prevalence of"private" colleges and universities, the proportion of students in state runinstitutions form the majority. Even those institutions that are labeled asprivate are essentially autonomous non-profit institutions. They are private inthe sense that their management is autonomous of government controls, butmost receive significant government grants in different ways. What isinteresting about these institutions is their system of governance that attemptsto ensure quality, excellence and competitiveness.Once again, I would not advocate the transplantation of any foreignsystem into India, since each system is rooted in its own peculiar history.What I would argue for is the generation of a new excitement for highereducation in the country and for a search for new resources and new forms ofgovernance that ensure quality and aim at achieving excellence.Overall, there is no way that we can sustain growth of the kind that weenvisage, 8 per cent plus annual growth, unless the whole education system,primary, secondary, vocational and higher is revamped. The State must bearthe responsibility for ensuring that this happens, but must organise it in such away that the best entrepreneurial energies that are now manifesting in thecountry are also harnessed towards the cause of education.HealthBefore I close on the subject of human resources, I should mention theissue of health. This is in itself a vast and complex subject which I am notcompetent to even touch. The key point that has to be made, however, is that27economic efficiency can only be achieved at different levels if people arehealthy. Whereas, a good deal of success has been achieved in almosteliminating a number of infectious diseases of the past, morbidity in Indiaremains high. There are significant issues related to the delivery of publichealth, particularly the availability of clean water and sanitation but there areequally important issues to do with the delivery of curative health. Here onceagain, there is widespread evidence of the deterioration of public medicalsystems which are being replaced by private providers. Given the availabilityof new techniques, new drugs, and diagnostics, the less well off areincreasingly finding it difficult to access these services at any semblance ofaffordable cost, and health insurance is in its infancy.If our young and expanding population is to look forward to a healthyand rewarding life, this is another vital area crying out for innovative,affordable systems of public private partnerships that are reliable andtrustworthy. Once again the public sector has to gain competence fororganising such a system.Public Sector ManagementThe common theme that runs through the three areas that I havechosen to illustrate the need for the next generation of reforms is that ofcompetent and innovative public management:  I have not spent any time onthe physical areas infrastructure since they have been discussed otherwisemuch more often. All the areas of physical infrastructure involve themanagement of large systems: airports, ports, railways, telecommunicationsand the like. All of them also have in common the possibility of at least partdelivery of the private sector.  As discussed, cities, education systems, healthsystems, hospitals, are also all large public service systems that are in direneed of efficient and innovative management. The key issue is that of efficientdelivery of public services, and in India particularly, at affordable prices.In most of these areas a large public sector presence is unavoidable.Urban water supply systems, sewerage systems, public lighting and publictransportation are typically organised by some form of governmental authority,and even if there is some element of private delivery.  Being essentialservices, there has to be some form of public regulation.  In the railways also,whereas some private delivery is possible, international experience suggeststhat basic infrastructure ownership has to be with the government, along withregulation and allocation. Similar is the case with ports and airports:  typicallyownership is usually with the government or public authority, while deliverycan often be prioritised.All such public management systems are typically very large andcomplex.  Hence they need excellence in public management.  One wouldimagine that the biggest management challenges would lie in themanagement of these large complex systems which, in principle, shouldattract the brightest managers. The irony, however, is that there is littlegeneration of expertise for such management functioning and there are fewprestigious schools of management that consciously impart training formanaging these systems.  All these systems need complex financial28management of huge budgets; all of them involve sensitive customer delivery;and all involve complex logistics. In other words, all such systems have all theelements that should attract the brightest people who like to deal withchallenges. It is ironic that there is a proliferation of management schoolsimparting complex training for small challenges, but none for these complextasks.What do we need to do? We need to make public service prestigiousagain: not for the exercise of power and authority, but for tackling challengesfor efficient public service delivery. Most public service delivery operations,including those run by the civil service, need the injection of outside expertiseat different levels. Each of our public authorities discourages lateral entry andtherefore tends to become inward looking and suspicious of new ideas.Lateral entry of outside experts would do much to inject new energy and evenpublic entrepreneurships.A theme running across the different sectors that have been discussedis the exploration and development of new forms of public privatepartnerships. It must be understood that these are not easy to foster. Theyusually involve the tension between of two different organising principles: onenon-profit and the other profit seeking.  The challenge is to design appropriateincentive systems so that the ultimate objective gets aligned. Different sectorswill need different forms of partnerships. In education, for example, thepartners could well be non-profit non-governmental organizations. In portsand airports, the partners could clearly be profit seeking private companies.Overall there has to be a search for innovative forms of public servicedelivery. This would also involve realignment of compensation levels. Ifindividuals of high levels of competence are sought to do the most complextasks they will need to be compensated adequately.We thus need a nationally generated focused programme to improvepublic administration and management at all levels of government and publicauthorities so that the delivery of public services becomes efficient. Thiscannot be done by the private sector and if it is not done the private sector willitself suffer from the emerging inadequacies of health, education, rural andurban infrastructure, and all other physical infrastructure.Concluding RemarksThe economic reforms process carried out in India over the last 15years has brought forth a burst of new entrepreneurial energies across theboard in almost all sectors. As a consequence, the country is now recordingsubstantial economic growth in excess of 8 per cent. This growth couldpossibly be constrained by the lack of both quality and quantity of publicservices supplied by the Government and its various authorities. Hence therehas to be all-round improvement in investment in and delivery of publicservices.The new focus of economic reforms has to be the empowerment of the publicsector to do what it is supposed to do: public services.29
