1On the Sources of Central Banker’s Influence over the Economy: CommentsChairman Mario Bleijer, Professor Stephen G. Cecchetti, Professor William H.Buiter, Dr Guillermo A. Calvo and fellow Governors,It is my pleasure to join the symposium and as desired by you, Mr. Chairman,offer initial informal comments on Professor Cecchetti’s paper on ‘Sources ofCentral Banker’s Influence over the Economy’.  Professor Cecchetti first succinctlybrings out the convergence of developments regarding application of monetarytheory to the practice of central banking and second, poses three challenges to bothacademics and practitioners.  I will make some general observations on theconvergence issue and later comment upon the challenges.  Of course, I shall drawupon India’s experience as appropriate.In terms of objectives, it is true that there is a convergence in the thinking ofall central bankers towards a primary objective such as price stability. It is useful tonote that, more recently, a strong trade-off between volatility in growth and inflationmasks or understates the equally important consideration of financial stability.  InIndia, along with price stability, growth objective is demonstrably subsumed in theobjective of meeting genuine credit demand and in communications and policymeasures, a clear focus on financial stability has assumed added significance inrecent years.Secondly, I agree with the point that the central banks have a better designthan before and also gained a distinct identity in the last two decades.  But withoutsatisfactory fiscal rules, implementation of any monetary rule becomes difficult asalso the autonomy or independence of central banks and its accountability.  It ismainly for political economy reasons that the central banks in general attempt tofocus sharply on a ‘single objective’ or mandate.  This is an arrangement forconvenience and merely gives a distinct identity to a central bank and serves as abasis for autonomy.  In India the fiscal dominance over monetary policy has comedown with elimination of automatic monetization of fiscal deficits in 1997 and                                                1 Prepared informal comments by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, initiating adiscussion at the Central Bank Governors’ Symposium, organised by the Bank of England at Londonon June 23, 2006.effective this year, withdrawal from participation in primary issuances of governmentsecurities.  In fact, Reserve Bank played an active and interactive role in designingfiscal rules in view of their criticality for monetary policy.  We provided technicalinputs and assistance to Government of India as well as States while consideringFiscal Responsibility Legislations.  The point of harmony between fisc and monetarypolicy is, therefore, well taken and I would stress, on the basis of our experience inIndia, the value of coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities in matters ofstructural transformation, specially legislations relating to the economy.Thirdly, on the emphasis placed upon the tool of short-term interest rate, thereal interest rate is, in some ways, an outcome of policy implementation incontaining inflation expectations.  Shifts in inflation expectations are indeed theproximate cause of the changes in the mean level of inflation and the policy makersdo, therefore, focus on maintaining credibility by carefully monitoring inflationexpectations for any indications that they are rising.  This forward-looking approachhas helped India in bringing down inflation rates from over eight per cent to aboutfour to five per cent in recent years.There is also a need to recognise the importance of inflation perceptions.  Inother words, if the prices of commodities, which are purchased frequently, rise, theperception of inflation would be different from say, a rise in the price of televisionset.  While recognizing the overlap, the distinction between inflationary expectationsand inflation perceptions in the context of inflation policy is worth bearing in mind.For example, inflation perceptions tend to harden if prices of frequently purchasedgoods increase.There is an interesting issue here on delicate distinction between monitoringand influencing inflation expectations on the one hand and giving forward indicationon the other.  In practice, it is a delicate task to make such distinction but it is criticalto bear such a distinction in policy-making and communication.  As GovernorMervyn King eloquently argued in his speech yesterday at the Lord Mayor’s banquetin the City, there are dangers of a central bank trying to give forward guidance inthis highly uncertain world.  Governor King said, “The Monetary Policy Committee(MPC) reaches a new judgment each month, made afresh in the light of all the newinformation about the prospects for inflation.  We don’t decide in advance.  So tryingto give direct hints on the path of interest rates over the next few months risksdeceiving financial markets into believing there are definite plans for the next fewmonths when no such plans exist”. In fact, the Fed announced a few days ago that Chairman Ben Bernanke hadestablished a sub-committee to examine a number of communications issues.  Moregenerally, the appropriateness of a central bank doing the thinking on course ofmarkets for the market-participants rather than allowing them to do it, isquestionable and this was articulated by Mr. Schioppa of European Central Bank acouple of years ago.  It is not surprising that almost all central bankers prefer toinform and to fall short of guiding.  The notable exception to this practice was theformer Chairman Alan Greenspan though his successor Mr. Ben Bernanke is clearlyrevisiting the approach, perhaps for very valid reasons.  Guidance on future coursebecomes far more difficult when the policy rates of monetary authorities get closer towhat appears to be the relevant range of neutral interest rates. This is because thetrade offs get more acute, judgmental and contextual relative to a state wheninterest rates are clearly farther from the range of possible neutral rates and thedirection of movement is fairly obvious to all.  The challenge of communication getsmore daunting, if simultaneously, the inflation expectations are also under stress.We, in India, prefer to provide detailed information and share relevantanalysis fully to influence expectations but are hesitant to give firm inferences fromanalysis or forward guidance.Fourthly, though the focus of central banks is on short-term interest rate andthe considerations weighing in a decision on this instrument require in practice,monitoring and analysis of a host of indicators, both external and domestic includingexpectations, perhaps even in the inflation-targeting countries.  We in India haveswitched to multiple indicators approach.  There are two issues that need to benoted here.  Where administered interest rates prevail, there are complications.There are also often inexplicable disconnects between the short and the long terminterest rates – what Chairman Greenspan had referred to as ‘conundrum’.Fifthly, financial stability considerations may, in our view, require the use ofinterest rate tool, in conjunction with other prudential measures.  Some times, therecould be even a trade-off between raising the short-term interest rate and tighteningof prudential norms if risks are perceived to originate from certain segments of themarket.  The highly leveraged lending operations in the backdrop of asset pricebubbles, might require adjustments in margins and risk-based capital requirements.In India, noticing the unusual movements in several asset prices in recent years, wehave been enhancing risk weights and provisioning requirements by banks forcertain categories of assets.Coming to the specific issues, since the focus of monetary policy is oninfluencing the ‘aggregate demand’, at the macro level, the aggregates represent anamalgamation of different forces in operation at the micro level, sometimes movingin different directions.  For instance, when the general price level increases, therecould be sectors where prices are coming down; the same is the case withemployment, consumption, production and investment.  Therefore, the microfoundations of macroeconomic analysis would not mean a one-to-onecorrespondence between the two.  This relationship is somewhat nebulous but veryimportant and should be viewed seriously with its significance as well as inherentlimitations in mind.Secondly, excessive leveraging in any conditions of financial markets is asource of potential instability. Since leveraging is influenced by the cost of financing,the decisions affecting the cost and availability of credit do influence aggregatedemand conditions.  Even if the source of financing is not bank funding, the interestrate conditions in the market definitely influence the opportunity cost of even internalresources of firms.  The effectiveness of interest rate and exchange rate channels,no doubt, depends upon the depth and vibrancy of the debt and foreign exchangemarkets.  In India, special efforts have, therefore, been made to develop thesemarkets so that the efficacy of the transmission channel improves.  In general, itmay be held that in less developed financial markets, by using direct monetaryinstruments in conjunction with market-based instruments, the overall policyeffectiveness can be improved.Nominal rigidities arise in different segments of the market due to a variety offactors: the existence of organised and unorganised markets in parallel, tax regime,labour and income policies and trade union strength, level of competition or marketimperfections, etc.  For example, since nominal rigidities are high in less developedand relatively imperfect and underdeveloped markets, it should not lead to aconclusion that monetary policy is more effective under these conditions.  Of course,in India recent events in equity markets are not easily explicable and so we canappreciate the comment that equity markets have a mind of their own.As a group, the central bankers could take some credit for little explicitindexation in recent periods.  However, the Indian conditions on indexations areworth noting.  The indexation is available only to workforce in the organised sector,which accounts for less than ten per cent of the total workforce, and within that,mainly to those in the public sector.  Having secured the principle of indexation, it isnot given up by the organised work force, whatever be the level of inflation.  Nodoubt, at the margin or incrementally, there could be less pressure for indexation,but existing privileges are not easy to be eliminated.On the policy actions, under relatively more stable economic environment,the need, the extent and the duration of the policy interventions becomes less andless.  Central banks are now taking baby steps – sometimes more frequent stepsand at other times after a long gap, and in both directions – to respond to, whatappear to be, ripples rather than huge waves in the sea of economic activity.  Forinstance, what is considered as a ‘neutral rate’ of interest in the present periodappears to be much lower compared to several years before.The issue of significance here is whether the neutral rate in respect ofemerging market economies, which has been coming down in tandem with globalrates, will tend to be distinctly higher than in developed economies.  If so, how muchhigher would be appropriate?Thank you.
