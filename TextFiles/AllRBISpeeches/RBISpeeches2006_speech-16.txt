1Changing Paradigms in Risk ManagementThe world of finance has always had an intuitive understanding of risk. The risksthat emerge from the increased variety and complexities of banking business, aswell as from the various new drivers of growth has pushed the contours of riskmanagement in banks much beyond what would probably have existed in themore traditional forms of banking activity of accepting deposits and lending inrelatively stable environments. Internationally, the last two decades or so havewitnessed significant changes in the profile of the banking sector, as well thenature of risk management in banks.  What perhaps has changed the nature ofrisk management, particularly are, inter-alia, advances in technology that haveaided quantitative approaches to risk management, like models etc., and theincreasing volumes of transactions in derivatives and other structured productsthat are so complex that they are often labeled “exotic”. India too has respondedto this change, tempered with a gradualist, non disruptive approach, that hasstood us in good stead over the years.In my brief remarks today, I intend to first, highlight few of the broader and moregeneral issues currently engaging the financial risk management fraternity andthen, move to the Indian context in this regard.I.  Some  general perspectives on risk managementQuantification of risk and model risk: As mentioned earlier, significantdevelopments in the area of quantification of risk, has shifted focus to statisticalaspects of risk management, especially to risk modeling and other computationaltechniques of risk measurement.  During the last decade there has been aproliferation of academic research on the use of VaR for market risk assessment.Such models have to be used with some care and serious examination of thedata used, especially the use of historical data for forecasting future scenarios,                                           1 Special Address by Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor at the FICCI-IBA Conferenceon "Global Banking: Paradigm Shift", September 27, 2006, Mumbai.1the assumptions behind the models, estimation errors etc. Further, if intradaypositions are not captured it would expose banks to such risks.Similarly in respect of Credit Risk, there is no single ‘‘best practice’’ model forcredit risk capital assessment, although the Basel 2 ‘‘Internal Rating Based’’methodology provides a portfolio model. Bank managements will have to focuson the determinants of credit risk factors, the dependency between risk factors,the integration of credit risk to market risk, data integrity issues like consistencyof data over long periods, accuracy and so on.Institutions are already mapping events to operational loss categories andbuilding warehouses of operational risk data for implementation of AdvancedMeasurement Approaches. Many data availability and reliability issues still needresolving. An internal loss experience for the important (low frequency, highseverity) operational risk types is rare and any relevant data are likely to be in theform of risk self-assessments and/or external loss experiences.Extreme events and stress testing: One of the key roles of the risk managementprocess is to manage extreme events, such as those associated with the tails ofstatistical distributions and could have probability of occurrence as low as onepercent. These are low probability but high loss instances associated withextreme operational events such as rogue trading or accounting fraud. Theimportance of stress testing to assess the impact of not only these events butalso the impact of various scenarios is engaging the attention of riskmanagement personnel, academicians and bankers alikeRisk based capital and back-testing: An important reason as to why thequantitative techniques have received so much attention, is not because of theintellectual satisfaction it can give to the academician but a rather mundanereason that it can be used to convince the regulator that given the risks asmeasured by these techniques the amount of capital required could be far lessthan that may be stipulated under broad brush, standardized techniques. Animmediate linkage between the risk models, the quantum of risk that is measured2by use of these models and the capital that is required to support these risksimmediately emerge. Estimates of capital being sufficient to meet the risk can beonly as good as the models are and the credibility of the models would ultimatelydepend upon their actual performance. Back testing the models to gauge andreduce the variance between the deviations of the actual numbers from thoseprojected are largely relied upon to give a degree of comfort to both managementof banks and supervisors alike.II. Indian PerspectiveInternationally, there has been a continuous coordinated effort under the aegis ofinstitutions like the BIS to evolve best practices in risk management in banks andthese have gradually come to be accepted as some sort of internationalstandards for banks across the world to benchmark themselves to. At theregulatory and supervisory level also, there has been an effort to achieveconvergence to the best practices set out by the BCBS after duly allowing fornational characteristics and feasibility. Banks have responded to this initiativewith varying levels of effectiveness.It was in October 1999, that the Reserve Bank issued guidelines on RiskManagement in banks setting out its expectations from banks; the guidelinesadopted an integrated approach to risk management. Even earlier, in February1999, banks were advised to set up an asset liability management framework tomanage liquidity and interest rate risk. In this context, I would like to makefollowing observations:a) The need to accelerate the speed at which banks have been movingtowards establishment of risk management systemsb) The need to achieve convergence with regulatory and supervisoryexpectations/requirements while deciding on the sophistication of methodsto be adopted.c)  Developing appropriate risk management architecture, MIS and skillenhancement3d) The need to integrate risk management process with capital planningstrategiesThe current business environment, with its pointed emphasis on corporategovernance, is making it critical for banks to explain their risk profiles publiclywith greater clarity and detail than ever before. Risk is still a complex andtechnical subject, so achieving transparency will not be easy. Internalconstituents, analysts, ratings agencies, investors, and regulators all havevarying levels of understanding of advanced risk measurement techniques. Allwill require continuing education before the market as a whole reaches acommon understanding of risk. In particulars, direct stakeholders in anytransaction need to be aware of the risks involved. For the third pillar of Basle II(Market Discipline) to be efficacious, it is important that the stakeholders areaware of the risks involved in the banks’ transactions and the systems in place tomanage the risks. In this context, the importance of an appropriateness policy forbanks offering various products to the corporate clients can't be over-emphasised.The risk management systems developed by banks would include a lot ofattention of top management to the suitability of IT structure including issues ofconnectivity, designing an MIS format that is risk focused, setting up anorganization to manage risk that ensures segregation of risk assessment fromoperations, frequent review of risk management systems to ensure there is noslippage and last but not the least, to develop appropriate skills within theorganization. In this context, it must be kept in view that risk management is notthe sole concern of the risk management department but rather a culture thatpervades the whole organization with specific support from the top management.III. Recent initiatives in risk managementIn India, over the years various steps have been taken to strengthen the RiskManagement Architecture, both at the bank specific level as well as a broadersystemic level.4ALM Guidelines: Most banks have put in place an ALM framework. Howeverthere is lot to be done to internalize this framework as a part of the overall riskperceptions of the bank and the capital planning strategy of the bank. Issues indata infirmity still remain to some extent. In many cases, the ALCO’s roleremains confined to deciding on interest rates of the bank. This is partly due tolack of decision support system available to the ALCO.  Availability of impact andscenario analysis of changes in yield structures would be a significant enablingfactor.The Reserve Bank has recently issued draft guidelines to banks with theobjective of graduating from the current maturity ladder approach prevalent inmost banks to a duration gap approach.  The later approach makes it possible forbanks to calculate the modified duration of assets and liabilities, the duration gapand duration of equity.  The concept of duration of equity gives banks, subject tocertain limitations, a single number indicating the impact of a one per centchange of interest rate on its capital, captures the interest rate risk and therebyhelps move a step forward towards assessment of risk based capital/economiccapital.Credit risk: Another important issue is that bank resources and supervisoryresources have concentrated on credit risk modeling of commercial and industrialportfolios, with relatively fewer resources devoted to risk quantification in the2retail credit area . The possible reasons could be (i) from a systemic perspective,it makes economic sense to devote more resources to evaluating the risk factorsof larger loans (ii)  there is a  long history of ratings agency evaluations forpublicly traded firms which , along with the extensive data available for publiclytraded firms, provided an extremely useful benchmark for the development ofquantification methods for commercial portfolios.However, despite this commercial side emphasis, retail credit is asubstantial part of the risk borne by the banking industry, and can not be ignored.                                           2 "Credit Risk Modeling: The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Perspective" Anthony M. Santomero, President, FederalReserve Bank of Philadelphia5Recognizing this, over the last decade or so, the industry and academia havedevoted significant resources to developing more sophisticated credit-scoringmodels for measuring this risk. Like their counterparts on the commercial side,these models also rely heavily on quantitative analysis.Derivatives: There has been a spurt of derivatives exposures in the off balancesheet exposures. The composition of derivatives portfolio of the banking systemhas also undergone a significant transformation. Forward foreign exchangecontracts which accounted for around 80% of total derivatives in March 2002declined steadily and stood at almost 43% in March 2006 while the share ofinterest rate contracts went up from 19% to 54% during the same period. Foreigncurrency options have recorded noticeable increase during the last year. Theshare of single currency interest rate swaps in total derivatives of the bankingsystem has risen sharply from 15% in March 2002 to 53% in March 2006.The risks arising on account of OBS activities of banks are controlledthrough a combination of both banks’ internal risk management and controlpolicies and risk mitigation mechanism imposed by the regulators. The boardapproved internal control policies covering various aspects of management ofrisks arising both on and off balance sheet exposures constitute the first line ofdefence to the bank. Holding of minimum defined regulatory capital for all OBSexposures, collection of periodic supervisory data and incorporating transparencyand disclosure requirements in bank balance sheet are some of the majorregulatory initiatives undertaken to control and monitor OBS exposures of thebanking system.The rapid proliferation of derivatives exposures inevitably poses achallenge on account of the downside risks associated with them, if not managedproperly. There are issues relating to use of structured products, valuation,counterparty related issues, risk management and reporting issues and last butnot the least, training and skill development. While derivatives facilitate riskhedging and risk transfer to institutions more willing to bear the risks, the6tendency of participants to use derivatives to assume excessive leverage, andlack of prudential accounting guidelines are matters of concern.One of the features of in the Indian derivative market relates toconcentration risk in respect of both the market makers (banks) and thecorporates. The combined share of top 15 banks has steadily grown from around74% in March 2002 to 82% of total OBS exposures of the banking system inMarch 2006, of which 62% is accounted for by foreign banks. Concentration ofknowledge is another risk which results in the concentration of derivative activityamong few players.RBI has been stressing on the need to carry out due diligence regardingcustomer appropriateness and suitability of products before offering derivativeproducts to their customers. There is need to use risk mitigation techniques suchas collaterals and netting to reduce systemic risks and evolve appropriateaccounting guidelines.RBI has also issued two separate draft guidelines, one forvaluation/accounting of investment portfolio in general and the second relating toderivatives. The proposed guidelines attempt to put in place fair value accountingnorms for derivatives broadly in line with IAS 39, the international accountingstandard for valuation and accounting for financial instruments.  For investments,the proposed framework envisages a symmetrical treatment for unrealized gainsand losses, with gains for  HFT being reflected in the Profit and loss account. ForAFS, however, a gain or loss on subsequent measurement shall be reflected in‘Unrealised gain/ loss on AFS portfolio’. Similarly for derivatives, all valuationgains and losses are proposed to be routed either through the P&L (for less than90 days) and or through a new account titled ' Unrealised gains/losses onderivatives' (90 days and more), somewhat similar to AFS portfolio. The idea is tobring all derivative transactions 'on-balance sheet' as against 'off-balance sheet'as is being done currently.Further, in order to address all issues related to derivatives in acomprehensive manner, we are now in the process of harmonizing the regulatoryprescriptions based on generic principles rather than approving specific products.7Stress Testing: The Governor in his Monetary Policy for 2006-07 had stressedthe need for banks to have robust stress testing process for assessment ofcapital adequacy given various possible events like economic downturns,industrial downturns, market risk events and sudden shifts in liquidity conditions.Similarly exposures to sensitive sectors and high risk category of assets wouldhave to be subjected to more frequent stress tests based. Stress tests wouldenable banks to assess the risk more accurately and, thereby, facilitate planningfor appropriate capital requirements.Subsequently RBI has issued draft guidelines on stress testing. Theseguidelines cover all major risk areas viz. market risks, credit risks, operationalrisks and liquidity funding risk. Banks are required to identify an appropriaterange of realistic adverse circumstances and events in which the identified riskcrystallises and estimate the financial resources needed by it under each of thecircumstances to : a) meet the risk as it arises and for mitigating the impact ofmanifestation of that risk; b) meet the liabilities as they fall due; and c) meet theminimum CRAR requirements. It may be pertinent to note that the banks havebeen advised to apply stress tests at varying frequencies dictated by theirrespective business requirements, relevance and cost.Financial Conglomerates: There is increasingly a need to extend the frameworkof risk management  to the group wide level, particularly among financialconglomerates. The rapid expansion of financial services, both in terms ofvolumes and variety have, as it is, posed a challenge for financial stability. This ismade all the more difficult by the organisational dimension which perhapsprovides scope for regulatory arbitrage. While this could appear beneficial to theorganisation in the short run, it only hightens systemic risk that in turn exposesthe institution to externalities which have a cost. There has been entry of somebanks into other financial segments like merchant banking, insurance andseveral new players have emerged who have a diversified presence acrossmajor segments of financial sector. Some of the non-banking institutions in the8financial sector can acquire proportions large enough to have a systemic impact.It has, therefore, become necessary not only for the supervisor to have a“conglomerate” approach to regulation and supervision but also for banksthemselves to put in place risk management systems at global levels i.e for thewhole organizational as a whole, rather than only the bank level. The risksassociated with conglomeration may include:1. The moral hazard associated with the ‘Too-Big-To-Fail’ position of manyfinancial conglomerates;2. Contagion or reputation effects on account of the 'holding out'phenomenon; 3. Concerns about regulatory arbitrage, non-arm’s length dealings, etc.arising out of Intra-group Transactions and Exposures (ITEs) bothfinancial and non-financialIt is in this context that the issue of integrated risk management, at the enterprisewide as well as group wide level, acquires significance. RBI has put in place aframework for oversight of financial conglomerates, along with SEBI and IRDA.Half-yearly discussions have also been initiated with the Chief Executive Officersof the designated entities of the conglomerates to address outstanding issues/supervisory concerns.IV. To conclude, at the systemic level, efforts have been made to create anenabling environment for all market participants in terms of regulation,infrastructure and instruments.  In this context, let me mention about two recentlegislative developments that may have far reaching impact on the financialmarkets in India.  One is the promulgation of the RBI (Amendment) Act, 2006. Amajor issue of concern in the OTC derivatives market in India was the issue oflegality. While the Securities Contract Regulation Act, 1956 gave specific legalrecognition to derivative instruments traded in the exchanges, there was noexplicit legal recognition of OTC derivatives in India. As legal clarity is a basicrequirement for the healthy development of any market, legality of OTC9derivatives was provided by an appropriate amendment to the RBI Act, withretrospective effect. RBI has also been now empowered to regulate the interestrate and forex OTC derivatives market.  The second legislative developmentpertains to the enactment of Government Securities Bill. The substantivechanges brought about in the Government Securities Act are that it provides forhypothecation, pledge and lien of government securities, maintenance of recordsin electronic form and most importantly, enables STRIPing of Governmentsecurities.Further, during the last few months, few liberalization measures have beenintroduced in securities market, that would surely have a bearing on the riskmanagement practices in the market, the most important being introduction of'when issued' trading and short selling in the G-Sec markets in a limited way.Currently the when issued trading is limited to reissuances only. We areexamining extending this to new issuances also, as requested by marketparticipants.What has developed incrementally over the years is now being consolidated andonce the regulations, infrastructure and appropriate accounting standardsstabilize, several other initiatives like credit derivatives could be considered.10
