Development of Financial Markets in India  * Rakesh Mohan  I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on the issue of development of financial markets along  with Mr. Christian Noyer, Governor of the Banque de France.  He has displayed a deep commitment to  the development of financial markets over the years and we heard a very thoughtful speech from him on  this subject at the Reserve Bank just two days ago.  His approach to financial markets is marked by a  great degree of pragmatism: as we develop financial markets we need to make sure that they serve our  needs, and we have to be equally conscious of the risks that they can generate if not managed well.  I welcome this opportunity to document the development of financial markets in India over the past  decade and a half.  With acceleration in economic growth in the country, the step up in savings and  investments, and expanded horizons of market participants, along with renewed thinking on fuller capital  account convertibility, discussion on financial market development has assumed a new urgency.  What are the key objectives of financial market development?  From our point of view, the basic aim of  financial market development must be to aid economic growth and development.  The primary role of  financial markets, broadly interpreted, is to intermediate resources from savers to investors, and allocate  them in an efficient manner among competing uses in the economy, thereby contributing to growth both  through increased investment and through enhanced efficiency in resource use.  The Reserve Bank has taken a proactive role in the development of financial markets, particularly over  the past decade and a half of overall economic policy reforms.  There has been a complete  transformation of the money market, the government securities market, and the foreign exchange market  over this period.  Development of these markets has been done in a calibrated, sequenced and careful  manner in step with those in other markets in the real economy.  The sequencing has also been informed  by the need to develop market infrastructure, technology and capabilities of market participants and  financial institutions in a consistent manner.  In a low income economy like ours, the cost of downside risk  is very high, so the objective of maintaining financial stability has to be constantly kept in view as we  develop financial markets.  What I would like to do today is to briefly recount the measures taken to  develop various financial markets in India, document the outcomes and broadly sketch out the direction of  the way forward.  From the point of view of the central bank, developed financial markets are critical for effective  transmission of monetary policy impulses to the rest of the economy. Monetary transmission cannot take  place without efficient price discovery, particularly with respect to interest rates and exchange rates. Deep  and liquid financial markets contribute to efficient price discovery in various segments of the financial  market. Well-integrated markets improve efficacy of policy impulses by enabling quick transmission of  changes in the central banks short-term policy rate to the entire spectrum of market rates, both short and  long-term, in the money, the credit and the bond markets. However, various benefits emanating from the  functioning of the financial markets depend critically upon the resilience of various segments of the  market to withstand shocks and the strength of the risk management systems in place. In view of the  critical role played by the financial markets in financing the growing needs of various sectors of the  economy, it is important that financial markets are developed further and well-integrated.   In recognition of the critical role of the financial markets, the initiation of the structural reforms in the early  1990s in India also encompassed a process of phased and coordinated deregulation and liberalisation of  financial markets. Financial markets in India in the period before the early 1990s were marked by  administered interest rates, quantitative ceilings, statutory pre-emptions, captive market for government  securities, excessive reliance on central bank financing, pegged exchange rate, and current and capital  account restrictions. As a result of various reforms, the financial markets have transited to a regime  characterised by market-determined interest and exchange rates, price-based instruments of monetary                                                    *  Address by Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the First Indian-French Financial Forum in Mumbai on  May 16, 2007.

Excessive fluctuations and volatility in financial markets can mask the underlying value and give rise to  confusing signals, thereby hindering efficient price discovery. Accordingly, policy efforts have also aimed  at ensuring orderly conditions in financial markets.  Furthermore, deregulation, liberalisation,  and  globalisation of financial markets pose several risks to financial stability. Financial markets are often  governed by herd behaviour and contagion and excessive competition among financial institutions can  also lead to a race to the bottom. The East Asian crisis of the 1990s suggested that global financial  markets can exacerbate domestic vulnerabilities. Notwithstanding the conventional wisdom that financial  markets punish deviations from prudent policies, financial markets, at times, seem to tolerate imprudent  behaviour for a remarkable stretch of time, while reacting pre-maturely at other times (Lipschitz, 2007). In  recognition of these possible destabilising factors, while liberalising domestic financial markets in India,  appropriate prudential safeguards have also been put in place. Enhancing efficiency, while at the same  time avoiding instability in the system, has been the challenge for the regulators in India (Reddy, 2004).  This approach to development and regulation of financial markets has imparted resilience to the financial  markets.  From the point of view of the economy as a whole, while developing financial markets it is essential to  keep in view how such development helps overall growth and development.  The price discovery of  interest rates and exchange rates, and the integration of such prices across markets helps in the efficient  allocation of resources in the real sectors of the economy.  Financial intermediaries like banks also gain  from better determination of interest rates in financial markets so that they can price their own products  better.  Moreover, their own risk management can also improve through the availability of different  varieties of financial instruments.  The access of real sector entities to finance is also assisted by the  appropriate development of the financial market and the availability of transparent information on  benchmark interest rates and prevailing exchange rates.  The approach of the Reserve Bank in the  development of financial markets has been guided by these considerations, while also keeping in view  the availability of appropriate skills and capacities for participation in financial markets both among  financial market participants and real sector entities and individuals.  The Reserve Bank's approach has therefore been one of consistent development of markets while  exercising caution in favour of maintaining financial stability in the system.  Money Market   The Reserve Bank has accorded prime attention to the development of the money market as it is the key  link in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to financial markets and finally, to the real  economy (Annex I). In the past, development of the money market was hindered by a system of  administered interest rates and lack of proper accounting and risk management systems. With the  initiation of reforms and the transition to indirect, market-based instruments of monetary policy in the  1990s, the Reserve Bank made conscious efforts to develop an efficient, stable and liquid money market  by creating a favourable policy environment through appropriate institutional changes, instruments,  technologies and market practices. Accordingly, the call money market was developed into primarily an  inter-bank market, while encouraging other market participants to migrate towards collateralised  segments of the market, thereby increasing overall market integrity.    In line with the objective of widening and deepening of the money market and imparting greater  liquidity to the market for facilitating efficient price discovery, new instruments, such as collateralised  lending and borrowing obligations (CBLO), have been introduced. Money market instruments such as  market repo and CBLO have provided avenues for non-banks to manage their short-term liquidity  mismatches and facilitated the transformation of the call money market into a pure inter-bank market.  Furthermore, issuance norms and maturity profiles of other money market instruments such as  commercial paper (CP) and certificate of deposits (CDs) have been modified over time to encourage  wider participation while strengthening the transmission of policy signals across the various market  segments. The abolition of ad hoc Treasury Bills and introduction of regular auctions of Treasury Bills  paved the way for the emergence of a risk free rate, which has become a benchmark for pricing the other  money market instruments. Concomitantly, with the increased market orientation of monetary policy along   2with greater global integration of domestic markets, the Reserve Banks emphasis has been on setting  prudential limits on borrowing and lending in the call money market, encouraging migration towards the  collateralised segments and developing derivative instruments for hedging market risks. This has been  complemented by the institutionalisation of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) as a central  counterparty. The upgradation of payment system technologies has also enabled market participants to  improve their asset liability management. All these measures have widened and deepened the money  market in terms of instruments and participants, enhanced transparency and improved the signalling  mechanism of monetary policy while ensuring financial stability.   These policy initiatives over time have led to the development of a relatively deep, liquid and vibrant  money market in the country. Activity in all the segments has increased significantly, especially during the  last three years. With the development of market repo and CBLO segments, the call money market has  been transformed into a pure inter-bank market from August 2005. A recent noteworthy development is  the substantial migration of money market activity from the uncollateralised call money segment to the  collateralised market repo and CBLO markets. Thus, uncollateralised overnight transactions are now  limited to banks and primary dealers in the interest of financial stability (Table 1).   Volatility in call rates has declined over the years, especially after the introduction of the Liquidity  Adjustment Facility (LAF). Under the LAF, the Reserve Bank sets its policy rates, i.e., repo and reverse  repo rates and carries out repo/reverse repo operations, thereby providing a corridor for overnight money  market rates. The weighted average overnight rate has largely moved within the corridor set by LAF  rates, barring some occasions, especially in recent months (Chart 1).

The operating framework of monetary policy has been the maintenance of overnight market rates within  an interest rate corridor defined by the floor of the reverse repo (absorption) rate and ceiling of the repo  (injection) rate.  During periods of system wide excess liquidity, overnight rates tend to hug the bottom of  the corridor, while touching the ceiling during other periods of liquidity shortage, as might be expected.   Increased volatility in capital flows, tending to inject excess liquidity into the system, and in government  cash balances resulting from bunching of tax payments that suck liquidity out of the system, have made  the task of liquidity management somewhat more difficult over the past year.  Consequently, volatility in  overnight rates has increased in recent months relative to previous years, with overnight rates breaching  both ends of the corridor.  After the adoption of the full-fledged LAF in June 2000, call rates, in general, witnessed a declining trend  up to 2004-05. The institution of LAF has also enabled the Reserve Bank to manage liquidity more  efficiently and reduce volatility in call rates. Volatility, measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of call  rates, has declined significantly in the current decade as compared with that in the 1990s (Chart 2), with  some increase in 2006-07, as already noted.    4Chart 2: Variation in Call Money Rates  1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0   The reduction in bid-ask spread in the overnight rates indicates that the Indian money market has  become reasonably deep, vibrant and liquid. During April 2004 ?February 2007, the bid-ask spread has  varied within a range of -0.37 to +1.32 basis points with an average of 16 basis points and standard  deviation (SD) of 11 basis points (coefficient of variation being 68.8). Despite a higher degree of variation,  however, the bid-ask spread remained within the 2-SD band around the average during most of the  period (Chart 3).

In line with the shifts in policy emphasis, various segments of the money market  have acquired greater depth and liquidity. The price discovery  process has also improved. The call  money market has been transformed into a pure inter-bank market, while other money market  instruments such as market repo and CBLO have developed to provide avenues to non-banks for  managing their short-term liquidity mismatches. The money market has also become more efficient as is  reflected in the narrowing of the bid-ask spread in overnight rates. The abolition of ad hoc Treasury Bills  and introduction of Treasury Bills auction have led to the emergence of a risk free rate, which acts as a  benchmark for the pricing of other money market instruments.    5 Per cent Coefficient of variation 4/1/2004 5/20/2004 1993-94 7/2/2004 8/13/2004 1994-95 9/27/2004 11/6/2004 1995-96 12/15/2004 1/19/2005 1996-97 2/25/2005 1997-98 4/6/2005 5/16/2005 1998-99 6/21/2005 7/29/2005 1999-00 9/5/2005 10/11/2005 2000-01 11/19/2005 12/24/2005 2001-02 1/31/2006 3/8/2006 2002-03 4/18/2006 5/25/2006 2003-04 6/29/2006 8/3/2006 2004-05 9/8/2006 10/16/2006 2005-06 11/23/2006 12/29/2006 2006-07 2/7/07Government Securities Market  The Reserve Bank has actively pursued the development of the government securities market since the  early 1990s for a variety of reasons (Annex II). First, with the Reserve Bank acting as the debt manager  to the Government, a well-developed and liquid government securities market is essential to ensure the  smooth passage of Governments market borrowings to finance its deficit. Second, the development of  the government securities market is also necessary to facilitate the emergence of a risk free rupee yield  curve to serve as a benchmark for pricing other debt instruments. Finally, the government securities  market plays a key role in the effective transmission of monetary policy impulses in a deregulated  environment.   In order to foster the development of the government securities market, it was imperative to migrate from  a regime of administered interest rates to a market-oriented system. Accordingly, in the early 1990s, the  Reserve Bank initiated several measures. First, it introduced the auction system for issuance of  government securities. While initially only yield-based multiple price auctions were conducted, uniform  price-based auctions were also employed during uncertain market conditions and while issuing new  instruments. Second, as the captive investor base was viewed as constraining the development of the  market, the statutory prescription for banks investments in government and other approved securities  was scaled down from the peak level in February 1992 to the statutory minimum level of 25 per cent by  April 1997. As a result, the focus shifted towards the widening of the investor base. A network of  intermediaries in the form of primary dealers was developed for this purpose. Retail participation has  been promoted in the primary market (through a system of non-competitive bidding in the auctions) as  well as in the secondary market (by allowing retail trading in stock exchanges). Simultaneously, the  Reserve Bank also introduced new instruments with innovative features to cater to diverse market  preferences, although the experience in this regard has not been encouraging.   Third, with the discontinuance of the process of unconstrained recourse by the Government to the  Reserve Bank through automatic monetisation of deficit and conversion of non-marketable securities to  marketable securities, the Reserve Bank gained more operational freedom. Fourth, in an effort to  increase liquidity, the Reserve Bank has, since the late 1990s, pursued a strategy of passive  consolidation of debt by raising progressively higher share of market borrowings through re-issuances.  This has resulted in critical mass in key maturities, and is facilitating the emergence of market  benchmarks. Fifth, improvement in overall macroeconomic and monetary management that has resulted  in lower inflation, lower inflation expectations, and price stability has enabled the elongation of the yield  curve to maturities upto 30 years.  Finally, the Reserve Bank has also undertaken measures to  strengthen the technological infrastructure for trading and settlement. A screen-based anonymous trading  and reporting platform has been introduced in the form of NDS-OM, which enables electronic bidding in  primary auctions and disseminates trading information with a minimum time lag. Furthermore, with the  setting up of CCIL, an efficient settlement mechanism has also been institutionalised, which has imparted  considerable stability to the government securities market.   With the withdrawal from the primary market from April 1, 2006 in accordance with the FRBM (Fiscal  Responsibility and Budget Management Act) stipulations, the Reserve Bank introduced various  institutional changes in the form of revamping and widening of the coverage of the Primary Dealer (PD)  system to meet the emerging challenges. Other measures taken to deepen the market and promote  liquidity include introduction of when issued trading, short selling of government securities and active  consolidation of government debt through buy backs.  Various policy initiatives taken by the Reserve  Bank over the years to widen and deepen the government securities market in terms of instruments as  well as participants have enabled successful completion of market borrowing programmes of the  Government under varied circumstances. In particular, a smooth transition to the post-FRBM phase has  been ensured.   The system of automatic monetisation through ad hoc Treasury Bills was replaced with Ways and Means  Advances in 1997, because of which the Government resorted to increased market borrowings to finance  its deficit. Accordingly, the size of the government securities market has increased significantly over the  years (Chart 4).     6Chart 4: Outstanding Stock of Central and State Government Securities (End-March)  40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007   The investor base for government securities, which was largely determined by mandated investment  requirements before reforms, has expanded with the voluntary holding of government securities.  Accordingly, the share of commercial banks has declined from 2004-05 (Chart 5).    Chart 5 : Ownership Pattern of Government Securities (End-March) 100 80 60 40 20 0 RBI Commercial Banks Other Financial Ins titutions Others   The PD system was essentially conceived for institutions whose basic interest is not to hold securities but  to participate in the primary auctions with the intent to act as market makers in the secondary market.   PDs are responsible for ensuring the success of primary auctions. The presence of PDs in the  government securities market has brought about an element of dynamism, both in the primary and the  secondary segments. PDs have been actively participating in the auctions of government securities. By  providing continuous two-way quotes, PDs act as market makers in the secondary market. The liquidity in  the secondary market, in turn, lends support to the success of primary market operations. The PD system  has facilitated better distribution of primary auctioned stock while providing better liquidity in the  secondary market (Table 2).  The decline in the share of PDs in the primary issuances in the recent  period needs to be seen in the context of increased bidding interest by insurance companies, particularly  in the long dated securities.    7 Per cent of total Per cent of GDP 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005  Table 2 : Role of Primary Dealers in the Government Securities Market     (Per cent) Share of  Government  Share in securities in   Year Primary Share in Turnover Total Assets of PDs*  Subscription  (Outright)  1 2 3 4 2001-02 65.0 27.7 79.8 2002-03 58.5 27.0 83.9 2003-04 51.5 23.9 82.2 2004-05 52.9 28.2 71.5 2005-06 40.4 31.1 60.9 2006-07 (P) 40.0 26.4 61.0 * At end-March.   Note: Data exclude devolvement but include MSS and Non-Competitive Bids.    One of the key issues in the development of the market for a better price discovery is liquidity of  securities. It was observed that, of the universe of a large number of outstanding securities, only a few  securities are actively traded in the secondary market. The Reserve Bank has been following a policy of  passive consolidation through re-issuance of existing securities with a view to enhancing liquidity in the  secondary segment of the government securities market. The share of re-issuances in the total securities  issued was 97.7 per cent during 2005-06. Active consolidation of government securities has also been  attempted under the debt buyback scheme introduced in July 2003, which is expected to be more actively  pursued now.    As a result of the developmental measures undertaken, the volume of transactions has increased  manifold over the past decade (Chart 6).

The decline could also be  attributed to the asymmetric response of investors to the interest rate cycle.  In the absence of a facility of   8short selling in government securities, participants generally refrained from taking positions which  resulted in volumes drying up in a falling market (Chart 7).

Subsequently, the short positions were permitted to be carried beyond intra-day  for a period of five trading days, effective January 31, 2007. To further improve the liquidity in the  government securities market, guidelines for trading in when issued WI market were issued by the  Reserve Bank in May, 2006.  Trading in WI segment, which commenced in August 2006, was initially  permitted in reissued securities. It takes place from the date of announcement of auction till one day prior  to allotment of auctioned securities. The revised guidelines extending WI trading to new issuances of  Central Government securities on a selective basis were issued in November 2006.   The Reserve Bank has followed a strategy of elongating the yield curve by issuing a fine blend of long- term securities along with the short-term to suit the preference of both the issuer and the investor. With  the issuance of longer term securities, the yield curve on government securities has emerged over a  spectrum of 30 years, although the yield curve is not liquid at the longer end of the maturity (Chart 8).

The primary market has attained a greater resilience, benefiting from  measures taken for the development of institutions and instruments. The functioning of the government  securities market since the mid-1990s indicates consistent increase in its size in tandem with the growth  in market borrowings of both the Central and the State Governments. Introduction of the auction based  system has improved the price discovery process. Reflecting the effectiveness of various measures to  develop the market, the turnover in the secondary market has increased manifold over the years. The  establishment of settlement and trading infrastructure has also led to increased activity in the secondary  market. The holding pattern of government debt shows some shift from banks to non-banks, reflecting a  progressive diversification of the investor base.  The yield curve on government securities has emerged  even as it is yet to become liquid at the longer end of the  maturity. Thus, the government securities  market in India has witnessed a transition to an increasingly broad-based market, characterised by an  efficient auction process, an active secondary market and a liquid yield curve.  These developments have  aided the smooth financing of government debt, of both the central government and state governments,  even when their fiscal deficits were high and rising.  This experience has enabled the greater recourse of  state governments to market borrowing as mandated by the Twelfth Finance Commission.   Foreign Exchange Market  The Indian foreign exchange market has witnessed far reaching changes since the early 1990s following  the phased transition from a pegged exchange rate regime to a market determined exchange rate regime  in 1993 and the subsequent adoption of current account convertibility in 1994 and substantial  liberalisation of capital account transactions (Annex III). Market participants have also been provided with  greater flexibility to undertake foreign exchange operations and manage their risks. This has been  facilitated through simplification of procedures and availability of several new instruments. There has also  been significant improvement in market infrastructure in terms of trading platform and settlement  mechanisms. As a result of various reform measures, liquidity in the foreign exchange market increased  by more than five times between 1997-98 and 2006-07 (Table 3).   In relative terms, turnover in the foreign exchange market was 6.6 times the size of India's balance of  payments during 2005-06 as compared with 5.4 times in 2000-01 (Table 4). With the deepening of the  foreign exchange market and increased turnover, income of commercial banks through such transactions  increased significantly. Profit from foreign exchange transactions accounted for more than 20 per cent of  total profit of scheduled commercial banks in the last 2 years.

Efficiency in the foreign exchange market has also improved as reflected in the decline in bid-ask  spreads. The bid-ask spread of Rupee/US$ market has almost converged with that of other major  currencies in the international market. On some occasions, in fact, the bid-ask spread of Rupee/US$  market was lower than that of some major currencies (Chart 9).  Chart 9 : Bid-Ask Spread of Select Currencies against US Dollar 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 INR GBP EUR JPY   The EMEs experience, in general, in the 1990s has highlighted the growing importance of capital flows in  determining the exchange rate movements as against trade flows and economic growth in the 1980s and  before. In the case of most developing countries, which specialise in labour-intensive and low and  intermediate technology products, profit margins in the highly competitive markets are very thin and  vulnerable to pricing power by large retail chains. Consequently, exchange rate volatility has significant  employment, output and distributional consequences. Foreign exchange market conditions have  remained orderly in the post-1993 period, barring occasional periods of volatility (Chart 10). The Indian  approach to exchange rate management has been to avoid excessive volatility. Intervention by the  Reserve Bank in the foreign exchange market, however, has been relatively small compared to total  turnover in the market.      11 per cent 1/3/00 5/3/00 9/3/00 1/3/01 5/3/01 9/3/01 1/3/02 5/3/02 9/3/02 1/3/03 5/3/03 9/3/03 1/3/04 5/3/04 9/3/04 1/3/05 5/3/05 9/3/05 1/3/06 5/3/06 9/3/06 1/3/07Chart 10 : Volatility in the Foreign Exchange Market 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0     The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring  and management of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a pre-announced target or a  band, coupled with the ability to intervene, if and when necessary. The overall approach to the  management of India's foreign exchange reserves takes into account the changing composition of the  balance of payments and endeavours to reflect the 'liquidity risks' associated with different types of flows  and other requirements. Illustratively, the Indian rupee exhibited two-way movements during 2006-07  moving in a range of Rs.43.1446.97 per US dollar. The rupee initially depreciated against the US dollar  during the year, reaching Rs.46.97 on July 19, 2006, reflecting higher crude oil prices, FII outflows and  geo-political risks in the Middle East region. The rupee, however, strengthened thereafter on the back of  moderation in crude oil prices, revival of FII inflows and weakness of the US dollar in the international  markets. The rupee appreciated further to reach  Rs. 40.59  per US dollar on May 7, 2007 due to  increased supply of dollars in the market. Thereafter, however, the rupee depreciated to Rs. 40.85 per US  dollar on May 16, 2007. At this level, the rupee appreciated by 6.7 per cent over end-March 2007 and 9.2  per cent over end-March 2006. Against the Euro, the rupee appreciated by 4.7 per cent over end-March  2007, but depreciated by 2.4 per cent over end-March 2006. The real effective exchange rate (REER) of  the Indian rupee (six-currency trade-based weights) at 112.2 as on April 18, 2007 appreciated by 12.2 per  cent over the base 1993-94; over 2000-01 the appreciation is by 9.6 per cent (Chart 11).

The typical forward contract is for one month, three months, or six months,  with three months being the most common. Forward contracts for longer periods are not as common  because of the great uncertainties involved. A swap transaction in the foreign exchange market is a  combination of a spot and a forward in the opposite direction.  Foreign exchange swaps account for the  largest share of the total derivatives turnover in India, followed by forwards and options (Table 5). Options  have remained insignificant despite being in existence for three years. With restrictions on the issue of  foreign exchange swaps and options by corporates in India, turnover in these segments (swap and  options) essentially reflects inter-bank transactions.

Note: Options denote foreign currency Indian rupee options. Turnover is calculated by taking the  difference between notional outstanding over the previous year.  With greater opening of the capital account, the forward premia is getting gradually aligned with the  interest rate differential reflecting growing market efficiency. In the post-liberalisation phase, forward  premia of the Indian rupee vis--vis dollar has generally remained high indicating that rupee was at a  discount to the US dollar. In recent times, however, reflecting the build-up of foreign exchange reserves,  the strong capital flows and the confidence in the Indian economy, forward premia have come down  sharply from the peak reached in 1995-96 (Chart 12).   Chart 12 : Movement of Forward Premia and  USD 40 60 30 50 20 40 10 30 0 -10 20 1-month 3-month 6-month Rs./USD (right scale)     As a result of various measures, the Indian foreign exchange market has evolved into a relatively mature  market over a period of time with increase in depth and liquidity. The turnover in the market has increased  over the years. With the gradual opening up of the capital account, the forward premia are getting  increasingly aligned with the interest rate differential. There is also evidence of enhanced efficiency in the  foreign exchange market as is reflected in low bid-ask spreads.    13 Mar- 93 Jan- 94 Nov- 94 Sep- 95 Jul-96 May- 97 Mar- 98 Jan- 99 Nov- 99 Sep- 00 Jul-01 May- 02 Mar- 03 Jan- 04 Nov- 04 Sep- 05 Jul-06The gradual development of the foreign exchange market has helped in smooth implementation of current  account convertibility and the phased and gradual opening of the capital account. The availability of  derivatives is also helping domestic entities and foreign investors in their risk management. This  approach has helped India in being able to maintain financial stability right through the period of economic  reforms and liberalisation leading to continuing opening of the economy, despite a great degree of  volatility in international markets, particularly during the 1990s.    Financial Market Integration  The success of a monetary policy transmission framework, which relies on indirect instruments of  monetary management such as interest rates, is contingent upon the extent and speed with which  changes in the central banks policy rate are transmitted to the spectrum of market interest rates and  exchange rate in the economy and onwards to the real sector. Changes in the central banks policy rates  can, through variations in domestic money market interest rates, impact the exchange rates, which, in  turn, impact the real economy. Similarly, movement in policy interest rates can influence other asset  markets such as equity and property prices, further strengthening monetary transmission. If markets are  weakly integrated, the central banks interest rate signals will not have the desired impact on other short  and long-term interest rates, the exchange rate and other asset prices. In such a scenario, the central  bank would need to act in various segments of the market to achieve the desired objectives. In brief, the  greater the degree of integration across market segments, the stronger is the transmission of monetary  policy to the spectrum of financial markets and on to the real economy. By enabling dispersion of shocks  and risks to a particular segment across all markets, well-integrated markets also contribute to financial  stability.   Financial market reforms in India have enabled a greater integration of various segments of the financial  market, reducing arbitrage opportunities, achieving higher level of efficiency in market operation of  intermediaries and increasing efficacy of monetary policy in the economy. Growing integration of financial  markets beginning 2000 could be gauged from cross correlation among various market interest rates. The  correlation structure of interest rates reveals several notable features of integration of specific market  segments (Table 6).    14Table  6: Correlation Among Major Financial Markets      RREO Call TB91 TB364 Yield10 CDs CPs FR1 FR3 FR6 EXCH LBSES  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  (April 1993 to March 2000)  RREPO 1.00             Call 0.35 1.00            TB91 0.44 0.61 1.00           TB364 0.32 0.40 0.90 1.00          Yield10 0.04 0.46 0.57 0.49 1.00         CDs 0.30 0.32 0.45 0.41 0.38 1.00        CPs 0.39 0.54 0.81 0.75 0.57 0.71 1.00       FR1 0.27 0.80 0.45 0.33 0.46 0.47 0.63 1.00      FR3 0.28 0.68 0.47 0.32 0.56 0.58 0.65 0.97 1.00     FR6 0.30 0.61 0.48 0.36 0.60 0.62 0.68 0.91 0.98 1.00    EXCH 0.03 -0.04 -0.23 -0.38 -0.06 -0.19 -0.31 -0.25 0.12 0.13 1.00   LBSES -0.37 -0.10 -0.24 -0.34 -0.05 -0.40 -0.28 -0.32 -0.28 -0.30 0.35 1.00  (April 2000 to December 2006)  RREPO 1.00             Call 0.86 1.00            TB91 0.86 0.95 1.00           TB364 0.84 0.92 0.99 1.00          Yield10 0.78 0.88 0.96 0.98 1.00         CDs 0.78 0.90 0.94 0.93 0.93 1.00        CPs 0.81 0.90 0.96 0.94 0.92 0.95 1.00       FR1 0.58 0.62 0.57 0.52 0.50 0.60 0.67 1.00      FR3 0.60 0.61 0.60 0.54 0.52 0.63 0.71 0.98 1.00     FR6 0.61 0.62 0.61 0.55 0.54 0.66 0.74 0.95 0.99 1.00    EXCH 0.29 0.20 0.14 0.08 0.04 0.24 0.28 0.60 0.66 0.70 1.00   LBSES -0.26 -0.23 -0.20 -0.15 -0.11 -0.27 -0.31 -0.57 -0.64 -0.68 -0.69 1.00  TB91 : 91-day Treasury Bills rate.

First, in the money market segment, there is evidence of stronger correlation among interest rates in the  more recent period 2000-06 than the earlier period 1993-2000, suggesting the impact of policy initiatives  undertaken for financial deepening. The enhanced correlation among interest rates also indicates  improvement in efficiency in the operations of financial intermediaries trading in different instruments.  Second, the high correlation between risk free and liquid instruments such as Treasury Bills, which serve  as benchmark instruments, and other market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and  commercial papers (CPs) and forward exchange premia, underlines the efficiency of the price discovery  process. Third, the sharp improvement in correlation between the reverse repo rate and money market  rates in the recent period implies enhanced effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. Fourth, the   15high degree of correlation between long-term government bond yield and short-term Treasury Bills rate  indicates the significance of term-structure of interest rates in financial markets. Fifth, the correlation  between interest rates in money markets and three-month forward premia was significantly high,  indicating relatively high horizontal integration.  Integration of the foreign exchange market with the  money market and the government securities market has facilitated closer co-ordination of monetary and  external sector management.  The impact of foreign exchange market intervention can be carefully  coordinated with monetary management encompassing constant monitoring of the supply of banking  system liquidity and an active use of open market operations to adjust liquidity conditions. Sixth, the  equity market appears to be segmented with relatively low and negative correlation with money market  segments.  A growing integration between the money, the gilt and the foreign exchange market segments was also  discernible in the convergence of financial prices, within and among various segments and co-movement  in interest rates (Chart 13).   Chart 13: Interest Rates and Exchange Rate in India 50 35 40 25 30 15 20 5 10 -5 0 CALL 91-TBills FR3 CP CD 10-Year G-Sec RREPO EXCH     The degree of integration of the foreign exchange market with other markets is largely determined by the  degree of openness. One of the indicators of foreign market integration is the differential in covered  1 interest rates .  In the Indian context, the forward price of the rupee is not essentially determined by the  interest rate differentials, but it is also significantly influenced by: (a) supply and demand of forward US  dollars; (b) interest differentials and expectations of future interest rates; and (c) expectations of future US  dollar-rupee exchange rate. Empirical evidence supports this view, as the three month forward premia  (FP3) has less than perfect co-movement with interest rate differential (between 91-day treasury bill rate  and three-month LIBOR), indicative of the time varying nature of the risk premium. The inter-linkage  becomes stronger when the interest rate differential is based on the monthly average call money rate and  one-month LIBOR (Chart 14). The relationship improves still further, when the difference between the  commercial paper (CP) rate in India and the 3-month US dollar LIBOR rate is considered for interest  parity assessments. The deviation of the forward premia from the interest parity condition appears to  increase during volatile conditions in the spot segment of the foreign exchange market.                                                    1  The Covered Interest Parity (CIP) implies that the rates of return on homogenous financial instruments that are  denominated in same currency, but traded domestically as well as offshore must be equal under efficient market  conditions, provided exchange controls do not exist and country risk premium is similar in two markets. The CIP  implies that yield on foreign investment that is covered in forward markets equals the yield on domestic investment.  The interest differential is offset by premium or discount on the forward rate. The absence of covered interest  differential indicates that there are some impediments to financial integration, attributable to some element of  market imperfection, transaction costs, market liquidity conditions, margin requirements, taxation and market entry- exit conditions.   16 Interest Rates and  Forward Premia (Per  cent) Apr-93 Feb-94 Dec-94 Oct-95 Aug-96 Jun-97 Apr-98 Feb-99 Dec-99 Oct-00 Aug-01 Jun-02 Apr-03 Feb-04 Dec-04 Oct-05 Aug-06 Exchange Rate  (Rs./US $)Chart 14 : Covered Interest Parity 25 15 5 -5 FP3 Spread from CP Spread from 91-day T-Bills   From the monetary policy perspective, there has been convergence among market segments, with a  significant decline in the spread of market interest rates over the reverse repo rate (Table 7). The spread  was the lowest for the inter-bank call money rate followed by rates on Treasury Bills, certificates of  deposit, commercial paper and 10-year government bond yield. The benefit of financial market  development percolating to the real sector is also evident from the moderation in spread of commercial  paper over the policy rate. The narrowing of the spread between the policy rate and other market rates  suggests the increasing efficiency of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.     Table 7: Interest Rate Spread over the Reverse Repo Rate   Item    April 1993 - Sept April 1993 - March April 2000 - Sept  2006 2000 2006 1  2 3 4 Call money Rate  1.75 2.98 0.43 Certificate of Deposits Rate  3.33 5.43 1.07 Commercial Paper Rate  4.01 6.09 1.78 91-day Treasury Bill Rate  1.71 2.90 0.42 364-day Treasury Bill Rate  2.13 4.18 0.75 10-year Yield on G-SEC  3.50 6.21 1.84   Thus, integration among various market segments has grown, especially in the recent period. This is  reflected in an increase in the depth of the markets and higher correlation among interest rates in various  market segments. Growing integration among various financial market segments was accompanied by  lower volatility of interest rates. The narrowing of the interest rate spread over the reverse repo rate  reflects an improvement in the monetary policy transmission channel and greater financial market  integration.   We can also note the gradual increase in depth of all financial markets in India over the years, including in  the equity market, though the average daily transaction volumes are the highest in the forex and money  markets (Table 8).     17 Per cent Apr- 93 Oct- 94 Apr- 96 Oct- 97 Apr- 99 Oct- 00 Apr- 02 Oct- 03 Apr- 05 Oct- 06Table 8: Depth of Financial Markets in India  Average Daily Turnover  (Rs.crore)  Year Money  Government Foreign Equity Market** Equity Market* Securities Exchange (cash segment) Derivatives Market Market # at NSE 1 2 3 4 5 6 1991-92@ 6,579 391 - 469 - 2000-01 42,657 2,802 21,198 9,308 11 2001-02 65,500 6,252 23,173 3,310 410 2002-03 76,752 7,067 24,207 3,711 1,752 2003-04 28,660 8,445 30,714 6,309 8,388 2004-05 38,528 4,826 39,952 6,556 10,107 2005-06 60,034 3,643 56,391 9,504 19,220 2006-07 88,803 4,863 83,984 11,760 29,803 *: Includes the call money, the notice money, the term money, the CBLO and the repo markets.  ** : Includes both BSE and NSE turnover.                    # : Inter-bank turnover only.  @: Data for G-Sec and equity market relate to 1995-96.  -: not available                                            Source: Reserve Bank of India; The Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai; and National Stock Exchange of  India Limited.    Summing up  The Reserve Bank has taken a keen interest in the development of the money, the government securities  and the foreign exchange markets in view of their critical role in overall growth and development of the  economy and particularly in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The approach has been one  of simultaneous movement on several fronts, graduated and calibrated, with an emphasis on institutional  and infrastructural development and improvements in market microstructure. The pace of reforms was  contingent upon putting in place appropriate systems and procedures, technologies and market practices.  Initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank have brought about a significant transformation of various  segments of the financial market.  These developments, by improving the depth and liquidity in domestic  financial markets, have contributed to better price discovery of interest rates and exchange rates, which,  in turn, have led to greater efficiency in resource allocation in the economy. The increase in size and  depth of financial markets has paved the way for flexible use of indirect instruments. Greater depth and  liquidity and freedom to market participants have also strengthened the integration of various segments of  the financial market. Increased integration not only leads to more efficient dispersal of risks across the  spectrum but also increases the efficacy of monetary policy impulses. Evidence suggests that growing  integration of various financial market segments in India has been accompanied by lower volatility of  interest rates.  While financial markets have certainly become more developed over the years, we are quite conscious of  the fact that development of financial markets is an ongoing process and there is still some way to go  before the markets are fully developed and integrated. Initiatives to further deepen and widen the various  segments of the financial market will, therefore, need to be pursued in the months and years ahead.   Financial markets will have to play an even more important role in future to sustain the current growth  momentum being experienced by the Indian economy but their development will need to continue to be in  step with corresponding real sector developments. Further development and integration of various  segments is also important in the context of envisaged move towards fuller capital account convertibility.  Accordingly, in the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2007-08 released on April 24, 2007, several  measures are being initiated to further develop the financial markets.   18 A number of initiatives have been announced for further development of the government securities  market.  With a view to helping investors to plan their investments in advance and, in turn, to avoid undue  liquidity pressure in the system, the operational modalities for introduction of an indicative calendar for  state government borrowing are being finalised. A Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme in the auctions of  State Development loans (SDLs) would be introduced in the financial year 2007-08. The modalities for  operationalisation of the scheme are being finalised.  Reissuance of SDLs has been favoured with a view  to building up a critical mass and thereby improving the secondary market liquidity of such securities. The  Reserve Bank  is in consultation with the State Governments to introduce a system of reissuances.  With a view to simplifying the methodology for pricing of floating rate bonds (FRBs) in the secondary  market, it is proposed to use the average cut-off yield on 182-day Treasury Bills, instead of the yield on  364-day Treasury Bills as a benchmark rate for the FRBs to be issued in future. The modalities for  undertaking active consolidation of Central Government securities have already been finalised in  consultation with the Government of India.  As the economy develops and financial markets become more sophisticated, market participants need  better access to risk management mechanisms.  Thus, interest rate derivatives need to be developed  further.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has recently issued comprehensive guidelines in respect of  interest rate derivatives, incorporating the broad regulatory framework for undertaking derivative  transactions. In respect of OTC derivative transactions, it has become necessary to have a mechanism  for transparent capture and dissemination of trade information as well as an efficient post-trade  processing infrastructure to address some of the attendant risks. To begin with, the CCIL is being advised  to start a trade reporting platform for Rupee Interest Rate Swaps (IRS). This reporting module would be  functional by August 31, 2007 and will thereafter be available to all market participants.  An anonymous order driven system for trading in Interest Rate Derivatives (IRDs) was introduced on  exchanges in 2003. Banks were allowed to hedge the risk in their underlying investment portfolio while  Primary Dealers (PDs) were also permitted as market-makers. Since then, the Government securities  market has undergone numerous developmental changes, including the introduction of short selling and  when-issued markets. Recognising the need for a robust interest rate futures market as an effective  instrument for management of interest rate risk, a Working Group is being set up to go into all the relevant  issues and to suggest measures to facilitate the development of the interest rate futures market.  As the capital account is gradually opened further the Reserve Bank has taken several initiatives to  provide a more conducive environment for the conduct of foreign exchange business. The prime concern  has been to provide prompt and efficient customer service by progressively liberalising foreign exchange  related transactions, removing restrictions and simplifying procedures. Concomitantly, powers have been  delegated to authorised dealers with a view to improving ease of transactions for the common person.  Keeping in view the recommendations of the Committee on Fuller Capital Account Convertibility  (CFCAC), several measures have been proposed in the Annual Policy Statement towards liberalisation of  foreign exchange facilities.    In order to provide greater flexibility to Indian companies for investments abroad and to rationalise the  existing facilities, it is proposed  (a) to enhance the overseas investment limit (total financial  commitments) for Indian companies from the existing limit of 200 per cent of their net worth to 300 per  cent of their net worth, as per the last audited balance sheet; and (b) to reckon the amount of guarantee  at 100 per cent of the amount instead of the current conversion factor of 50 per cent for determining the  total financial commitments.   At present, listed Indian companies have a separate limit of 25 per cent of net worth for portfolio  investment abroad in listed overseas companies. It has been decided to enhance this limit to 35 per cent  of net worth.  At present, the aggregate ceiling on overseas investment by mutual funds is US $ 3 billion.  With a view to providing greater opportunity to mutual funds for investment overseas, it is proposed to  increase the ceiling to US $ 4 billion.   In order to further liberalise the remittance scheme for individuals, the present limit of US$ 50,000 is  being enhanced to US$ 100,000 per financial year for any permitted current or capital account transaction  or a combination of both.   19The basic principle for accessing domestic foreign exchange markets is hedging of underlying foreign  exchange exposures. In keeping with the evolution of the foreign exchange market and the increase in  depth and volumes, a range of hedging instruments have been permitted to market participants including  foreign exchange forwards, swaps and options, but mainly against crystallised foreign currency  exposures. However, it has now been decided to expand the range of hedging tools available to the  market participants as also to facilitate dynamic hedging by the residents in respect of other economic  exposures.  This will include hedging of price risk faced by domestic producers of non-ferrous metals,  users of aviation turbine fuel, and others facing similar systemic international price risk.  In order to  facilitate dynamic hedging of foreign exchange exposures of exporters and importers of goods and  services, it is proposed to enhance this limit to 75 per cent from 50 per cent earlier.  Similarly, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are being permitted to hedge their foreign exchange  exposures.  They will be allowed to book forward contracts without underlying exposures or past records  of exports and imports. Furthermore, resident individuals are being enabled to manage/hedge their  foreign exchange exposures, including anticipated exposures up to an annual limit of US $ 100,000,  which can be freely cancelled and rebooked.  In view of the increasing exposure of Indian entities to foreign currency risk, it has also been decided to  set up a Working Group on Currency Futures to study the international experience and suggest a suitable  framework to operationalise the proposal, in line with the current legal and regulatory framework.  These initiatives can be seen within the overall context of the financial sector development in the country,  particularly, in the money market, government securities market and the foreign exchange market. As we  gain experience, with the implementation of these initiatives, we can expect a continuing process of  financial market development that aids the overall development process. Similar efforts are being  undertaken by the Government and the securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India  along with the Reserve Bank in activating the corporate debt market. As has been experienced  elsewhere, among the various financial markets, the corporate debt market is indeed the most difficult to  develop for a variety of reasons. Our experience with development of the government securities market  suggests that a great deal of detailed work will need to be undertaken over a period of time to put in place  an appropriate market micro infrastructure, trading platforms, technology and clearing and settlement  systems, along with further development of both issuers and buyers. The expansion of the pension fund  and insurance industries will progressively result in the presence of a larger financial investor base, which  will help in the overall expansion of financial markets and in particular the corporate debt market.      20Annex I: Money Market Instruments for Liquidity Management    The Reserve Bank has been making efforts to develop a repo market outside the LAF for bank and  nonbank participants, so as to provide a stable collateralised funding alternative with a view to promoting  smooth transformation of the call/notice money market into a pure inter-bank market and for deepening  the underlying Government securities market. Thus, the following new instruments have been introduced.    Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO)   Developed by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) and introduced on January 20, 2003, it  is a discounted instrument available in electronic book entry form for the maturity period ranging from one  day to ninety days (can be made available up to one year as per RBI guidelines).   In order to enable the market participants to borrow and lend funds, CCIL provides the Dealing  System through Indian Financial Network (INFINET), a closed user group to the Members of the  Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) who maintain Current account with RBI and through Internet for other  entities who do not maintain Current account with RBI.   Membership (including Associate Membership) of CBLO segment is extended to banks, financial  institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, primary dealers, NBFCs, non-Government Provident  Funds, Corporates, etc.   Eligible securities are Central Government securities including Treasury Bills.   Borrowing limits for members is fixed by CCIL at the beginning of the day taking into account the  securities deposited by borrowers in their CSGL account with CCIL. The securities are subjected to  necessary hair-cut after marking them to market.   Auction market is available only to NDS Members for overnight borrowing and settlement on T+0  basis. At the end of the Auction market session, CCIL initiates auction matching process based on  Uniform Yield principle.   CCIL assumes the role of the central counter party through the process of novation and guarantees  settlement of transactions in CBLO.   Automated value-free transfer of securities between market participants and the CCIL was introduced  during 2004-05.   Members can reckon unencumbered securities for SLR calculations.   The operations in CBLO are exempted from cash reserve requirement (CRR).    Market Repo   To broaden the repo market, the Reserve Bank enabled non-banking financial companies, mutual  funds, housing finance companies and insurance companies not holding SGL accounts to undertake repo  transactions with effect from March 3, 2003. These entities were permitted to access the repo market  through their gilt accounts maintained with the custodians.   Subsequently, non-scheduled urban co-operative banks and listed companies with gilt accounts with  scheduled commercial banks were allowed to participate.   Necessary precautions were built into the system to ensure delivery versus payment (DvP) and  transparency, while restricting the repos to Government securities only.   Rollover of repo transactions in Government securities was facilitated with the enabling of DvP III  mode of settlement in Government securities which involves settlement of  securities and funds on a net  basis, effective April 2, 2004. This provided significant flexibility to market participants in managing their  collateral.    Some Assessments   CBLO and market repo helped in aligning short-term money market rates to the LAF corridor.    Mutual funds and insurance companies are generally the main supplier of funds while banks, primary  dealers and corporates are the major borrowers in the repo market outside the LAF.

Automatic monetisation of fiscal deficit through the issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills was phased out.   Primary Dealers (PD) were introduced as market makers in the government securities market.   For ensuring transparency in the trading of government securities, Delivery versus Payment (DvP)  settlement system was introduced.   Repurchase agreement (repo) was introduced as a tool of short-term liquidity adjustment.  Subsequently, the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was introduced.   LAF operates through repo and reverse repo auctions and provide a corridor for short-term interest  rate. LAF has emerged as the tool for both liquidity management and also signalling device for interest  rates in the overnight market. The Second LAF (SLAF) was introduced in November 2005.   Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) has been introduced, which has expanded the instruments  available to the Reserve Bank for managing the enduring surplus liquidity in the system.   Effective April 1, 2006, RBI has withdrawn from participating in primary market auctions of  Government paper.   Banks have been permitted to undertake primary dealer business while primary dealers are being  allowed to diversify their business.   Short sales in Government securities is being permitted in a calibrated manner while guidelines for  when issued market have been issued recently.   The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 has been amended recently whereby the floor rate of 25 per  cent for SLR has been removed.
