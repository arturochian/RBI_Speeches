Central Banks and Risk Management: Pursuing Financial Stability*Rakesh MohanI have chosen to speak on “Financial Stability” for a number of reasons.  Althoughfinancial stability has always been of concern to central banks, it is a relatively new conceptin terms of the widespread attention being given to it in recent years.  I thought it would beuseful to discuss why it has become so important to central banks.  Achieving thisunderstanding would also help in explaining some of the behaviour of central banks.  I willalso try to explain why it is important for us.Financial Stability: What Is It?What is financial stability? Despite widespread usage of the term, there is nowidespread agreement on a useful working definition of the term.   Some define financialstability in terms of what it is not – the absence of financial instability.  Others take a moremacro-prudential view and specify financial stability in terms of limitation of risks ofsignificant real output losses in the presence of episodes of system wide financial distress.In the absence of a widely accepted definition it is useful to discuss what we expect afinancial system to do. The primary function of the financial system is to smoothly and efficiently facilitateinter-temporal allocation of resources from savers to the ultimate users. This process ofintermediation of funds enables the utilisation of available resources to their most productiveuses. Such a process implies management of financial risk on an inter-temporal basis. Indoing so however, the financial system is expected to absorb real economic surprises andshocks. If for some reason this is not done well, it could impair the efficient functioning of thefinancial system as a whole and engender financial instability.But we need to be careful in thinking about financial instability.  Disturbances infinancial markets or at individual financial institutions need not constitute financial instabilityif they do not impair overall economic functioning. Illustratively, a closure of a smallfinancial institution, or for that matter, movement in asset prices within certain limits or evenminor corrections in financial markets need not necessarily hamper stability. On the contrary,fluctuations in asset and other prices in financial markets may actually be good for overallfinancial stability as adjustment mechanisms.  Such market adjustments also help to keepauthorities alert and sensitive to incipient developments and can enable them to identify and                                                * th Address of Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at the 4 Annual Conference on Cash, Treasuryand Risk Management in India on November 21, 2006 at New Delhi.

What are important from the macroeconomic standpoint are issuesrelated to contagion and systemic risk, which can lead to economy-wide upheavals andwould, therefore, need to be monitored on an on-going basis.The point of making these observations is that unlike price stability, which can beeasily quantified, financial stability cannot be easily summarised into a single measure. As aconsequence, monitoring financial stability needs to encompass not only financial institutionsand markets, but also the state of financial infrastructure: a stable financial system depends asmuch on the health of financial institutions as it does on the complex inter-linkages betweenthose institutions and the interplay between the financial system, the financial markets and theassociated financial infrastructure. The integrity of the payment system is at the core of thefinancial system, and confidence in the use of money as a unit of account is essential tomaintenance of financial stability.  While central bankers have always been concerned withaddressing these aforesaid aspects, the issue therefore remains: why is there an overt concernwith financial stability in modern-day financial systems?Historical BackgroundTo understand the current outbreak of concerns, let us review a little bit of history. Itwould be useful to start of with salient developments in the world economy since the early1900s in order to understand the relevance of financial stability in modern day financialsystems.Until World War I, the international experience had broadly been of long run priceand monetary stability.  A great degree of turbulence followed after the conclusion of WorldWar I: the German hyper-inflation, the Great Depression, World War II itself, the Koreanwar, and later the Vietnam war.  It is not surprising that in the presence of such economic andpolitical dislocation, price and financial stability also suffered during this period.  Thefinancing of wars led to fiscal expansionism usually financed by money creation.  Thus aperiod of relatively high inflation ensued in the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in double digitinflation in the US and Western Europe in the late 1970s, spiked by severe oil shocks of the1970s.  Thus, after this long tumultuous period of fluctuating inflation during the 1960s and1970s, aggressive disinflationary policies of the early 1980s brought international inflationdown to tolerable levels.Prior to World War I, the gold standard was, in some sense, the anchor of monetary,price and financial stability.  Central Banks’ commitment to ensuring the convertibility oftheir currency into gold at fixed prices did much to engender confidence in the system.  Therewas also a significant degree of cooperation among the central banks and governments ofmajor economies, which helped to lubricate the system in its functions in times of financialimbalances (Eichengreen, 1992).  The gold standard, however, came under severe strain afterWorld War I in the wake of the breakdown in cooperation between countries.  Theconsequence was the depression, competitive devaluations, beggar thy neighbour policies,3decline in world trade and high unemployment, at different times in different countries duringthe inter war period.  Overall, there was a great degree of instability during this period.The quest for a new international economic order that would restore economic andfinancial stability in the world gave rise to the Bretton Woods institutions and the BrettonWoods Currency System.  It was not until 1958 that most European currencies becameconvertible and many currency adjustments took place after the end of World War II.  Theanchor now was essentially the US dollar as the reserve currency and the commitment to itsconvertibility to gold.  The International Monetary Fund was to act as the lender of last resortin case of balance of payment crises.  But even this fixed exchange rate system lasted only till1971.  The over-financing of exports, the economic pick up in hitherto war torn countries ledto the glut of the dollar; and the American inflation of the 1960s; all contributed to thecessation of dollar convertibility to gold.  The fixed exchange rate system got abandoned afterthe Smithsonian agreement.  The floating exchange rates that then followed meant that theworld was left without an easily understood, credible monetary anchor.  Hence the increasingquest for methodologies promoting financial stability.The other major feature of global financial markets has been the trends in capitalflows. A major surge in capital flows started around the 1870s and continued till World War I.This era, which coincided with the operation of the gold standard, has been regarded untilrecently as the golden era of capital mobility. Open trade and open labour markets alsocharacterized this period.  In retrospect, there was an effective system shut down after WorldWar I, almost until the 1970s.  During the inter war period, the world economic system gotcharacterized by increasing trade restrictions, high tariffs, curbs on capital flows, fixedexchange rates and other rigidities.  Post World War II it has taken a long time to open upinternational trade through the Successive GATT Rounds and now through the WTO.The period after 1973 has been characterized by floating exchange rates and graduallyincreasing international capital flows, along with increasing volumes of international trade.The geographical demarcation of national borders gradually became less of a constraint forboth trade and capital flows.  By the 1990s, open trade and open capital accounts led to aphenomenal growth cross border flows, including to developing countries and the emergingeconomies in Eastern Europe.All this entailed a phenomenal expansion of financial activity. This was partly inresponse to the demographically-driven increase in the amount of investible wealth, but alsoreflected the increased need for markets and institutions to channel funds between anincreasingly active and diverse range of borrowers and lenders.At the same time, domestic financial liberalization led to the removal of constraintson the activities of financial institutions of different kinds within a given national market inmany countries. The liberalization of cross-border capital movements and rights of marketaccess meant that a broader range of domestic and foreign institutions were able to providebanking and other financial services in a given market. The range of services on offer also4expanded; and an increasing number of both markets and institutions became active acrossnational boundaries. While this entailed lower costs of products and services for consumers,this also entailed the possibility of contagion with ramifications extending well beyondnational borders particularly in the context of inadequate development of financial markets insome countries.On the flip side, however, this transformation of the financial marketplace extendedand tightened linkages across markets and institutions, increasing the uniformity of theinformation sets available to economic agents and encouraging greater similarity in theassessment of information, driven to a large extent by advances in information technology andcommunications networking. This, in effect, meant that weaknesses in the financial systemcould engender serious and far more disruptive economic consequences than was previouslythe case, and could increasingly engender contagion effects extending well beyond nationalboundaries. The Mexican crisis of 1994-95, the East Asian crises of 1997-98 and the morerecent crises in Argentina and Turkey are ample testimony to this fact. At the national level,the banking crises in Nordic countries in the 1980s and 1990s, the problems in the Philippinesand Korean banking systems in the 1990s (and the near panic at the time of the LTCM affair),and the financial bubble in Japan whose costs are felt even at present, deserve mention.During the 1980s and 1990s, nearly one hundred national banking systems collapsed,many more than in any comparable previous period.  The range of movements in exchangerates and the extent of deviations in market exchange rates from real exchange rates – themagnitude of undershooting and overshooting – were larger than in any previous period.There were also massive asset price bubbles in some countries:  Japan, Sweden, Thailand,South East Asian Countries like, Malaysia and finally in the United States.All this meant that the sources of crises, which were earlier traced primarily toweaknesses in banking systems, became manifold, and could emanate from any segment ofthe financial sector with possibilities of spillovers to other sectors and countries. Moreimportantly, as the Asian crises amply demonstrated, such crises could even affect economieswith sound real sector fundamentals. The deficiencies in the international financialarchitecture meant that the IMF was no longer large enough to take care of the crises. Theearlier concerns on banking stability therefore become much larger in scope and content, toassume the term ‘financial stability’. These developments have had several consequences for the institutional and systemicstructure. Among the most important of these from the point of view of systemic significancehas been disintermediation. Credit-worthy firms are relying increasingly on capital markets,rather than bank loans, to finance investment projects. This has led to the deepening of capitalmarkets of various kinds, as well as to a more important role for the institutions that deal intraded securities.A second important structural change is the emergence of markets for risks ofdifferent kinds, in which exposures to specific market or credit risk can be bought and sold5separately from financial assets. This has provided economic agents the leeway to reduce orincrease their exposure to specific categories of risk.A third key trend has been changes in the business profile of financial institutions. Inmany countries, services traditionally associated with “banking” are now offered byinstitutions not legally characterized as banks, while banks are increasingly engaged in para-banking activities.These fundamental changes – deregulation, liberalization and disintermediation –have, not surprisingly, made financial systems far more interconnected, with possibleramifications for contagion in the event of an exigency in any country. As a consequence,central banks, which were traditionally focused on monetary and banking stability, haveincreasingly come to focus on financial stability as a key concern in the conduct of monetarypolicy.How are Central Banks Responding to this Development?Avoiding crises becomes ultimately a national responsibility. The impact ofinstability in times of crisis typically tends to be borne by domestic taxpayers rather than theglobal private entities. The burden of such an asymmetric adjustment means that there is aneed to institute domestic mechanisms that could focus on the aspect of financial stability onan on-going basis. As institutions traditionally mandated with the task of price stability,central banks became the natural choice for Governments to be entrusted with oversight offinancial stability.Given that financial stability has become a paramount focus of central banks, the keyquestion therefore arises is: how are central banks responding to the challenge? Interestingly,new legislations explicitly provide mandates for financial stability; illustratively, Hungarypassed such legislation in 2001, the Netherlands in 1993, Spain in 1994 and the UK in 1997.So, the question is why have the central banks become interested in financialstability? Central banks are clearly responsible for issue of currency, maintaining its value asa means of exchange and unit of account.  They are also responsible for maintaining theefficiency and integrity of payment systems.   Ultimately, they are the lenders of last resort.Notwithstanding the complexity involved, evidence suggests that involvement in financialstability can be broadly categorised into five types of activities. Being a key fulcrum of thepolicy apparatus responsible for financial stability, central banks might be involved in severalof these tasks.First, oversight of the financial infrastructure: This involves the operation as well asoversight of the payments and settlement systems and securities clearing system. It might alsoinvolve oversight of financial disclosures, market conduct and the like. It is important to notethat all at the markets need the payment system, including the capital market.6Second, regulation and supervision of financial entities: This involves theformulation of prudential guidelines (capital adequacy and reserve requirements, provisioningnorms, risk management standards), the monitoring of compliance with those rules (on-siteinspection and off-site surveillance) and the imposition of sanctions in case of non-compliance.Third, safety net provisions: This involves decisions to restructure troubled banks aswell as ‘honest brokering’. It also involves the operation of financial safety net in the form ofdeposit insurance.Fourth, Liquidity: The response to a crisis may necessitate judicious use of theemergency liquidity assistance facilities in order to avoid disruptions from disorderly failuresand to contain contagious strain.  Only central banks can inject liquidity.Fifth, market surveillance: central banks are often involved in the regulation andsurveillance of markets. The three markets that are primarily the focus of surveillance bycentral banks are the money, bond and foreign exchange markets.In addition, central banks are typically concerned with macro financial stability. Thisencompasses monitoring the behaviour of all important players in the financial sector, thehealth of non-financial sector balance sheets as well as assessment of systemic vulnerabilities.This analysis is accompanied by communication policy on financial stability issues, eitherthrough dedicated financial stability reports or disclosure of information on financial stabilityas part of regular reports (Annex 1). The basic motive behind such reports is to communicateto the markets and the public at large and thereby express the commitment of the central bankfor achieving its objectives. This is accompanied by a process of structured communicationamong the various bodies involved in the pursuit of financial stability.In their quest for financial stability, central banks worldwide have exhibited a varietyof responses. On the one hand, several central banks have been given an explicit mandate topromote financial stability (Annex 2). Another broad category of response has been theconstitution of independent departments to oversee financial stability. Illustratively, at theReserve Bank of New Zealand, the supervisory and financial market departments weremerged into a Financial Stability Department. At the ECB, the area concerned with financialstability matters (Prudential Supervision Division) was upgraded to a Directorate (FinancialStability and Supervision), which reports to a member of the Executive Board, and plays acoordination role for euro area/ EU financial stability monitoring. Finally, the Bank ofEngland has also constituted a dedicated Financial Stability Department for oversight offinancial stability matters, headed by a Deputy Governor. The transfer of supervisoryresponsibilities outside the central bank in several countries has also led central banks to focustheir attention on systemic issues as reflected in a reorientation of organisationalarrangements.The crux of these observations is that financial stability has been a prime locus ofchange in central banks and increasingly, central banks are taking a pro-active stance to7address the threats posed by financial instability. For instance, the Financial Stability Forum,for instance, was created in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, comprising members asmajor countries, international financial institutions such as BIS and IMF and the internationalstandard setters such as International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) andInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).Having traced the broad contours of the growing importance of financial stabilityworldwide and the role played by central banks in the process, let me turn to how the ReserveBank has been responding to the challenge.Indian Experience on Financial Stability – An OverviewTill the onset of reforms in the early 1990s, India was a relatively closed economy,being largely insulated from the vicissitudes of global markets.  It was not, of course, totallyinsulated from exogenous shocks.  The severe drought of 1965 to 1967, the oil shocks of1973, 1979 and 1989, and wars all had significant effects including the emergence of externalpayments crises.  However, the financial system was effectively controlled, particularly in the1970s and 1980s and the risk of financial contagion was therefore not high.The gradual opening up of the economy since the 1990s raised several importantchallenges for central bankers. The opening of the external sector meant that developments inIndia came to be increasingly influenced by developments abroad. It is interesting to look atsome numbers. Contrary to various perceptions, the Indian economy is now substantivelyopen.  As the Finance Minister observed in a lecture at Yale University, whereas India’s GDPin 2004-05 was roughly US $700 billion, the gross flows on the current account and the1capital account, put together, came to US $500 billion.  This is despite the fact that tradetariffs are still higher than in most other countries in the world, and that capital accountcontrols still exist. The large capital inflows, despite the cautious approach to liberalization,meant that such flows can engender volatility in exchange rate movements. The speed ofcapital flows, both inward and outward, is much higher than current account flows and cantherefore destabilize the exchange rate, and operation of financial and capital markets,possibly in response to external events unconnected with the domestic economy (Jalan, 2003).Consequently we have to be concerned with exchange rate instability, as distinguished frommere fluctuation, for its potential to affect other markets, both goods and capital markets.Exchange rate instability arising from external events can give rise to domestic instability inthe operation of the stock market, government securities markets, and the money markets,along with their attendant effects.  For emerging economies such as India, it thereforebecomes necessary to institute special defenses for ensuring financial stability. Furthermore,with the interest rate emerging as a key channel of monetary policy signals, the efficacy ofmonetary transmission is predicated on the health of the financial sector.  The gradual                                                1 Chidambaram, P (2005): "India, the US and the Evolving World Economy", Lecture Delivered atYale University, September 2005.8liberalization of the financial sector has also witnessed the emergence of conglomerates, withattendant systemic implications.More broadly however, the period since the 1990s has been testimony to severalshocks impinging on the economy. Illustratively, nuclear sanctions and the border tensions inthe late 1990s, the monsoon vagaries in the recent past, most recently in 2003, the crises inEast Asia in 1997 and 1998, the upheaval in domestic stock markets in May 2004 coupledwith the recurrent oil price fluctuations, has meant that the economy has been susceptible tointermittent shocks. And unlike the shocks of earlier decades, the economy has been able towithstand these disruptions with limited impact on the financial sector. The role of centralbanks in such a milieu is not hard to foresee.  The response of the Reserve Bank in May, 20042is a case in point. Judged thus, the role of Reserve Bank in its task of monitoring financialstability can hardly be over-emphasized.Financial stability has, therefore, emerged as a key consideration in the conduct ofmonetary policy. In this process, the Reserve Bank has adopted a two-track approach in thepursuit of financial stability. First, by ensuring monetary stability through lowering ofinflation, it has lowered inflationary expectations, thereby fostering financial stability.Second, the Reserve Bank has adopted a multi-pronged strategy, with suitable country-specific adaptations, to promote stability of financial institutions, financial markets and thefinancial infrastructure. The stable economic regime combined with the macro financialoversight of the financial system has imparted confidence to market players to conduct theirbusiness in an orderly manner.In general, it is possible to discern two broad sets of instruments by which theReserve Bank has been addressing the financial stability concerns: preventive instruments,comprising micro and macro prudential measure and reactive instruments, comprisingliquidity support measures and public intervention tools aimed at safeguarding depositors’interests.With regard to institutions, the Reserve Bank founded the Board of FinancialSupervision in 1994 to upgrade its practice of financial supervision.  A set of prudentialnorms for the commercial banking sector had been instituted as early as 1994 with regard to                                                2 On May 17, 2004, the stock market witnessed turbulent conditions, caused mainly by politicaluncertainty after the general elections. External factors such as rising oil prices and apprehensions ofrise in international interest rates also contributed to the sudden reversal of market sentiment. Inresponse, the Reserve Bank initially intervened in the forex market and once it was realized that therewere no spillovers to other markets, maintaining the integrity of the payment and settlement systemassumed prominence. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank operated at three different levels. First,settlement banks were informed that in case of liquidity problems, they could access the ‘backstopfacility’ under LAF from the Reserve Bank. Second, a statement was made informing marketparticipants that there was no shortage of liquidity in the system, either in domestic or foreign currency.Finally, this was followed by a statement that carried credibility for the system at large. A Task Forcewas constituted for providing clarifications and liquidity assistance. Certain prudential relaxations wereprovided for a temporary period to market players in the light of market conditions and the same wassubsequently restored to normal levels once markets returned to normal functioning. The idea inherentin this process was to ensure no transmission of panic from equity to other markets.9capital adequacy, income recognition and asset classification (IRAC), provisioning, exposurenorms and more recently, in respect of their investment portfolio. The approach adopted herewas one of gradual convergence with international best practices, while internalizing it to suitcountry-specific requirements. In tandem with the gradual opening up of the economy, theregulatory and supervisory framework was spruced up comprising of a three-pronged strategyof regular on-site inspections, technology-driven off-site surveillance and extensive use ofexternal auditors. As a result of improvements in the regulatory and supervisory framework,the degree of compliance with the Basel Core Principles has gradually improved. Thesupervisory framework has been further upgraded with the institution of a framework of Risk-based Supervision (RBS) for intensified monitoring of vulnerabilities. A scheme of PromptCorrective Action (PCA) was effected in December 2002 to undertake mandatory anddiscretionary intervention against troubled banks based on well-defined financial/prudentialparameters. In view of the growing emergence of financial conglomerates and the possibilityof systemic risks arising therefrom, a system of consolidated accounting has been instituted.A half-yearly review based on financial soundness indicators is being undertaken to assess thehealth of individual institutions and macro-prudential indicators associated with financialsystem soundness. The findings arising thereof are disseminated to the public through itsvarious Reports. In fact, in 2003 that the Reserve Bank published a chapter titled ‘FinancialStability’ in its Report on Currency and Finance in that year, highlighting its challenges andproblems in the pursuit of stability. Subsequently, with effect from 2004, the annual statutoryReport of Trend and Progress of Banking in India has began to publish a dedicated chapter onfinancial stability. This is in addition to the Monetary and Credit Policy Review where theGovernor highlights the threats and challenges to the financial environment beforeannouncing policy measures.Given the multi-faceted nature of financial stability, no one body might be in aposition to monitor it in its entirety. Keeping this in view, the Ministry of Finance hasconstituted a High-Level Coordination Committee on Financial and Capital Markets with theGovernor, RBI, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Chairman,Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) along with the Finance Secretary,Government of India as members to address policy gaps and overlaps.An important aspect of the financial stability process has been the growing emphasison the role of market discipline. As part of the process, the Reserve Bank has laid strongemphasis on the levels of transparency and standards of disclosure in banks’ balance sheets.These disclosures, presently supplemented as ‘Notes on Accounts’ not only encompassesprudential ratio pertaining to capital adequacy (tier-I and tier-II separately) ratio, non-performing loans, exposure to sensitive sectors (capital market, real estate and commodities),but also financial ratios such as interest and non-interest income as percentage of workingfunds, return on average assets and net profit per employee. These disclosures have beengradually expanded over time and presently include maturity pattern of assets and liabilities(both Rupee and FC), movements in non-performing loans, issuer composition of non-SLRinvestment, assets subject to corporate debt restructuring as well as details of assets sold toSecuritisation / Reconstruction company.10You would also appreciate that the performance of the non-financial sector has animportant bearing on financial stability. Keeping this in view, the Reserve Bank has also beenclosely monitoring the stability ratios of the non-financial sector. In the corporate sector forinstance, the reduction in debt liabilities following corporate restructuring and reducedinterest expenses in an environment of low interest rates has improved the financial stabilityindicators in manufacturing. Available indications are that both consumption and investmentdemand are currently buoyant. Business surveys also point to high levels of both businessconfidence and capacity utilisation. The improved investment sentiment and businessconfidence, as reflected in the increasing number of firms incurring capital expenditure,suggests the prospects for buoyant manufacturing growth in 2005-06.You would all be aware that issues of governance in banks has assumed relevanceworldwide in the wake of accounting irregularities in the US and elsewhere. Problems ingovernance can derail even the best efforts on the part of regulators to ensure financialstability. To address this aspect, the Reserve Bank issued guidelines on ownership andgovernance based on well-defined principles, viz., a well-diversified ownership and control;important shareholders being ‘fit and proper’; directors and CEO being ‘fit and proper’ andobservation of sound corporate governance principles.An important hallmark of the pursuit of financial stability in India has been theadoption of a consultative approach to policy formulation, taking on board the variousstakeholders in the financial system. Such an approach has had the merit of providing usefullead time to market participants to adjust their behavior in conformity to the regulatoryguidelines.Evidence suggests that no two crises are exactly alike. As a result, in addition topreventative instruments just discussed, the Reserve Bank had also resorted to reactiveinstruments.One such instrument is emergency liquidity support. Thus, in very rate and unusualcircumstances, when a bank faces a sudden and unforeseen liquidity problem, the ReserveBank has, on an earlier occasion, at its discretion, extended liquidity support to the bank.A second such instrument is the provision of safety net in the form of depositinsurance (DI). In India, DI is mandatory and covers all banks (commercial / cooperative /3RRBs / LABs). All deposits except (a) deposits of foreign governments, (b) deposits ofCentral/State governments, (c) inter-bank deposits and (d) deposits held abroad are coveredby DICGC. The amount of coverage is presently Rs.1 lakh (Rs.100,000), and is provided todeposits held in the same right and in the same capacity. Given the present limit, as much as95 per cent of deposit accounts and 66 per cent of assessable deposits are fully protected.                                                3 Deposit insurance is not applicable to cooperatives where the Cooperative Societies Act under whichthey are registered do not comply with the provisions of Section 2 (gg) of the DICGC Act, 1961. DIhas also not been extended to cooperative banks in certain North-Eastern states (Meghalaya, Mizoram,Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland) and union territories (Lakshadweep, Chandigarh and Dadra andNagar Haveli) which do not have the legal framework in place.11Given the level of per capita GDP at constant prices (Rs.15017 in 2004), this implies that thecoverage limit is roughly 6 times the per capita GDP (Annex 3). The premium is charged on aflat rate basis, which is presently 8 paise per Rs.100 of assessable deposits for the year 2004-05 and 10 paise from 2005-06 (earlier it was 5 paise per Rs.100 of assessable deposits).A third instrument is treatment of insolvent banks (winding down). The ReserveBank, rather than closing them down, has shown a preference for merging such banks withhealthy banks. The rationale behind such an approach has been dictated by twoconsiderations. First, given the dominance of commercial banks, their closure can raisesystemic concerns. Second, given that a significant portion of bank depositors in India aresmall, it is imperative to safeguard their interests, while dealing with insolvent banks (Mohan,2004).The second broad element of strategy has been the development of financial markets.Ensuring orderly conditions in financial markets has been an important component of theReserve Bank’s approach towards financial stability. The cornerstone of the process has beento widen, deepen and integrate various segments of financial markets to enable the pricediscovery process, lower transactions costs and enhance market liquidity. Accordingly, theoperating procedures of monetary policy have been continuously fine-tuned to attune it to therealities of market dynamics.In the money market, the focus has been on developing a deep and liquid moneymarket, supplanted by a wide array of instruments to modulate monetary conditions with arelative emphasis on indirect policy instruments to enable swift responses to changing marketconditions. In the face of large capital flows, a new facility in the form of Market StabilisationScheme (MSS) was instituted in April 2004. The MSS essentially seeks to differentiate theliquidity absorption of a more enduring nature by way of sterilisation from the day-to-daynormal liquidity management operations.In the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate policy adopted by India has beenone of managing volatility with no fixed target, while allowing the underlying demand andsupply conditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way.Market players are also enabled to manage risk through various designated hedginginstruments. Prudent management of the external sector coupled with a calibrated approach tocapital account liberalization has been an important component of macroeconomic policy toensure financial stability.In the government bond market, the major objectives of reforms were to impartliquidity and depth to the market by broadening the investor base and ensuring market-clearing interest rate mechanism. The important initiatives introduced included a market-related government borrowing and consequently, a phased elimination of automaticmonetisation of Central Government budget deficits. This, in turn, enabled the shift fromdirect to indirect tools of monetary regulation -activating open market operations and thedevelopment of secondary market. The entire range of changes necessitated developments in12(a) instruments, (b) institutions and (c) technology, along with concomitant improvements in(d) transparency and (e) the legal framework.  As of April 1, 2006 the FRBM Act nowprohibits the Reserve Bank from subscribing to government securities in the primary market.This has necessitated the further development of techniques and instruments to ensurestability in the G-securities market.Developing a robust and secure financial infrastructure has been a key component offinancial stability. Towards this end, the Reserve Bank undertook several initiatives toupgrade the payment and settlement system in the country. Salient among these includedElectronic Clearing Service, Electronic Funds Transfer, establishment of a secured privatenetwork which serves as a private gateway to the financial system. Based on the frameworkprevalent in developed financial markets, a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system hasbeen operationalised. The RTGS provides for an electronic-based settlement of inter-bank andcustomer-based transactions with intra-day collateralised liquidity support from the ReserveBank. Side by side, in its quest for benchmarking with international best practices, theReserve Bank has benchmarked its conformity with the Core Principles for SystematicallyImportant Payment System (CPSS). The degree of compliance with these Principles ispresently on par with those prevailing internationally.Challenges to Financial StabilityGiven the inherent dynamic nature of financial stability, its operationalization raisesseveral challenges.First, the changing structure of the financial system with the blurring of boundariesbetween financial institutions and markets raises significant policy challenges. As I remarkedearlier, services traditionally associated with ‘banking’ are presently being offered byinstitutions not legally characterized as banks, while banks are increasingly engaged in para-banking activities. Such ‘conglomerisation’ of financial activity raises the possibility ofsystemic risk with attendant implications for financial contagion, which lies at the very root offinancial instability.Second, in this context coordination between the regulators assumes paramountimportance. In recognition of these concerns, the Reserve Bank has taken a structuredapproach to their surveillance by instituting a coordinated monitoring mechanism with otherdomestic regulators (SEBI and IRDA) on matters of supervision of financial conglomerates.In addition, the Reserve Bank has been holding half-yearly discussions with the ChiefExecutive Officers of the conglomerate in association with other principal regulators toaddress outstanding issues and supervisory concerns. This process is working well at present.However, as financial development takes place in India we can expect further blurring ofdistinction between different types of financial intermediaries.  We can also expect greaterpresence of large financial conglomerates, including foreign ones.  Hence, we need toconsider the development of a more organized approach to the regulation and oversight of theemerging financial conglomerates as has been done in other countries.  In the United States,13for example, the Federal Reserve Board has been designed as the lead umbrella supervisor offinancial holding companies (FHCs).   Pending such developments, as a workable measure,there could be need to execute general/specific memoranda of understanding (MoU) as part ofthe process of supervisory co-ordination towards furtherance of financial stability.Third, another significant feature of the Indian economy post-reforms has been thegreater opening up of the economy. The size of merchandise, as well as services trade, hasbeen increasing steadily in recent years, reflecting greater integration of the economy with therest of the world. The recent experience also suggests subtle shifts in internationalcomparative advantage with software, business and commercial services gaining prominence.Overall capital flows have also been buoyant, given the positive outlook on the economy. Thelarge capital flows have, in turn, resulted in accumulation of reserves, rendering the reserveposition comfortable according to various indicators of reserve adequacy. While thesedevelopments have resulted in benefits, it has also made the economy much less quarantinedfrom global developments and the task of central bankers that much more difficult than in theerstwhile autarkic regime. As a result, central bankers have to be continuously alert andwatchful not only to domestic but also global developments because, as the Asian crisestestifies, developments abroad can have significant domestic ramifications even for aneconomy with perfectly sound fundamentals.Fourth, the spread of the financial system with growing liberalization of the economyand the increasing reach of formal finance has gradually expanded to cover larger segments ofthe population. The 'demographic dividend' of a larger and younger labour force has meantthat banks have been able to expand their loan portfolio quite rapidly, enabling consumers tosatisfy their lifestyle aspirations as a relatively young age with an optimal combination ofequity and debt to finance consumption and asset creation. On the other side, such opening uphas also meant that interest rates have become a much more potent tool of monetary policy,affecting consumption and investment decisions of the population in a fashion much morerapidly than was the case earlier. With a sizeable proportion of the population having limitedability to insure themselves against unforeseen contingencies, there is merit in considering theneed to devise ‘shock absorbers’ in order to insulate the economy from contagion effects.Continuous and pro-active efforts towards developing a robust financial system andinstituting appropriate market surveillance mechanisms that can throw up 'early warningsignals' of financial distress are important parameters of such resilience.The fifth challenge to the maintenance of financial stability lies in the increasinggrowth of the economy. The traditional measure of national accounting does not takecognizance of the knowledge flows that create value in the medium to long run. Thisphenomenal growth of the knowledge economy and its value-enhancing effect are onlyrecently being addressed for the US economy. Judged from this standpoint, it seems thatcentral banks would not only need to keep track of traditional measures of consumption andinvestment, but in addition, have a hang of the knowledge flows across borders in order toassess the impact of its decisions on the real economy. This is easier said than done andmoving ahead from the traditional accounting framework to a more 'realistic' one14incorporating 'knowledge flows' is a challenging task that central bankers will have to dealwith sometime sooner than later.Another challenge relates to the issue of coordination policy-making bodies.Instabilities can arise in any segment of the financial system and not necessarily in segmentswhich are under the domain of the Reserve Bank, although through contagion effects, theireffects are likely to be felt across the entire financial sector. This calls for closer andcontinuous coordination among the various policy-making bodies, including an even broaderset of players such as accounting standard setters, legislators and tax authorities. Themultiplicity of policy actors emphasizes the need for a cooperative organization of policyefforts in this regard.The opening of trade has meant the death of commodity inflation. The expectations offinancial market participants on financial variables are different from the market expectationsof commodity prices. The recent surge in the stock market is likely to engender the 'wealtheffect', which through multiplier process, is likely to spillover into prices and moreparticularly, into asset prices. Although such a phenomenon is widely acknowledged,attempting to precisely quantify the spillover from commodity to asset prices and themagnitude of such over-extension remains a challenge. There is a need in this context forserious analytical work that can explore the link in the movements between commodity pricesand asset prices.Concluding ThoughtsOver the last few years, the global financial system has been buffeted by a number ofpressures and some unprecedented shocks. Nonetheless, the system has continued to proveresilient and financial stability has been maintained. Potential fault lines that have emerged inthe process, viz., those pertaining to corporate governance, auditing and accounting standardsand prudential norms have been receiving close scrutiny from policy makers.The Indian financial system is not quarantined from global developments, but ourjudgment is that it remains robust, underpinned by the continued expansion of the Indianeconomy. The task for all of us is therefore to remain alert and proactive, identify and addressnewer risks, eschew harmful incentives and adjust the regulatory environment to address anyunforeseen contingency in the economic environment.15ReferencesEichengreen, Berry (1992): Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression,1919-1939.
