1India and the Global EconomyFriends,I am delighted to be here in the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy ofAdministration, Mussoorie.  You are among the few that have succeeded in perhapsone of the most competitive and fairest examinations in the world.  You have theadditional advantage of having spent some time in the rural and semi urban areas ofour country while in the districts.  I chose the subject `India and global economy’precisely because during the next three to four decades that you will be serving ournation, the biggest challenges and opportunities for our country would be in the ruraland semi-urban areas.  An important driver of  change in rural India would be theimpact of integration of the Indian economy with global economy.  It is a happycoincidence that the respected Chief Minister of Uttranchal, Shri N.D. Tiwari, whospoke to you in the preceding session today, urged you to closely follow thedevelopments in the global economy even while you work in sub-divisions, districtsand States. Mr. Mukesh Puri, your Course Director asked me whether the topic of mytalk today was, indeed, 'India and the global economy' and not 'India in the globaleconomy’. I clarified that it was ‘and’ and not “in” the global economy.  Simply stated,till recently the issue had been how India would manage its growing integration withthe global economy.  Of late, there is some discussion on how the global economywould adjust to the successful global integration of India.2. In the first part of the presentation, as a background, there will be a briefaccount of global economic integration and the role of public policy.  This will befollowed by a review of India’s policies in regard to the external sector.  The thirdsection will mention what appear to be the current challenges for the global economyas India integrates with it.  The fourth section would be in the nature of randomthoughts on the public policy challenges in our country to manage the integrationsmoothly.  The fifth section will elaborate on several issues in regard to financialintegration.  The issues include the special characteristics of financial integration andour policy in this regard including that for the banks.Global economic integration3. The concept of globalisation, in the sense in which it is used now, can betraced to the phenomenon of nation states.  In the distant past, there were just humancommunities.  For much of human history, most people remained confined to theircommunities, villages or local areas.  With developments in communication andeconomic activity, it has progressively become easier to move from the local to theregional and then from the regional to the national level, and finally across nations.Perhaps globalisation is a process that has been, in some sense, constrained by theauthority of the nation states, particularly in the twentieth century.  It may be useful totouch upon the role of the public policy of nation states, in the context of the conceptof globalisation.  After the emergence of the nation states, each nation stateperceived that it was in its collective self-interest to promote or restrict involvementwith citizens of other nation states.  While developments in technology enabled and                                                1 Address by Dr. Y V Reddy, Governor, RBI at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy ofAdministration, Mussoorie, Uttaranchal on July 17, 2004.2accelerated the movements of goods, people and services, the policies of manynations tended to impose restrictions.  A nation state is presumed to put restrictionson its citizens in their involvement with other nation states only in the collective self-interest of its citizens.  It is, however, not easy to define what is in the collective self-interest of all its citizens or of only a few at the expense of others.  In the context ofthe public policy relating to globalization, a critical issue is the trade-off betweenindividual freedom and the collective self-interest and also whether the onus of prooflies with the individual or the national authorities.  It is difficult to resolve these issuesbut they must be appreciated in the context of public policy.4. At a conceptual level, a distinction can be made between technology-enabled(or induced) globalization and public policy-induced restrictions or easing ofrestrictions. Globalization has several dimensions arising out of what may be calledenhanced connectivity among people across national borders.  Such enhancedconnectivity is determined by three fundamental factors viz., technology, individualtaste and public policy. Cross-border integration can have several aspects: cultural,social, political and economic. For the purpose of this presentation, however, onlyeconomic integration is considered. Broadly speaking, economic integration occursthrough three channels, viz., movement of people, of goods and, of finance or capital.5. Firstly, on the aspect of movement of people, the most notable achievement ofrecent globalization is the freedom granted to many, if not all, from the tyranny ofbeing restricted to a place and being denied the opportunity to move and connectfreely.  Secondly, in regard to trade in or movement of goods across the nationalboundaries, two types of barriers generally are described viz., natural barriers andartificial barriers. Of late, while the multilateral trade agreements are encouragingreduction in such artificial barriers, the developments in technology are also making itdifficult for national authorities to enforce artificial barriers.  The pace and nature ofglobalization will naturally depend on the combined effect of technology and thepublic policy, both at the national and the international level.  The third dimensionrelates to capital movements for which also, the interplay between technology and thepublic policy becomes relevant. There have been, however, some specialcharacteristics of capital flows in recent years mainly led by revolutionary changes intelecom and computing capabilities. These have highlighted the phenomenon of whatis described as "contagion", which implies the risk of a country being affected by thedevelopments totally outside of its policy ambit, though domestic policy may, to someextent, influence the degree of its vulnerability to the contagion. In any case, cross-border flows of capital have wider macroeconomic implications, particularly in termsof the exchange rate that directly affects the costs of movement of people as well asgoods and services and, also in terms of the conduct of monetary policy and theefficiency as well as stability of the financial system. Capital flows, by definition,generate further liabilities or assets and could involve inter-generational equity issues.In this regard, it is useful to distinguish the extent of globalisation in respect of threedifferent types of economic entities viz., individuals or households, corporate entitiesand financial intermediaries. It has been noticed that financial intermediaries impingeon the contagion effects impacting financial stability in the developing countries.Experience in Asia and Latin America has shown that the external liabilities of theprivate sector tend to devolve on national governments in the event of crises andhence, there is a role for the public policy in trying to prevent crises and creatingcapacities to meet crises, if and when they arise.36. In managing the process of economic integration that is driven by severalforces, developing countries face challenges from a world order that is particularlyburdensome on them. Yet, it is necessary for the public policy to manage the processwith a view to maximizing the benefits to its citizens while minimizing the risks; but thepath of optimal integration is highly country-specific and contextual.  On balance,there appears to be a greater advantage in achieving a well-managed andappropriate integration into the global process, which would imply more effective –but not necessarily intrusive or extensive – interventions by governments. In fact,while there are some infirmities in interventions by government, markets doexperience market-failures and cannot exist without some externally imposed rulesand prescriptions of the public policy. As the poor, the vulnerable and theunderprivileged continue to be the responsibility of the national governments, there isrelevance of national public policy – particularly as it relates to global economicintegration.External Sector Policies: A Review7. It is useful to outline the major developments in external sector policies sinceour independence as a background to enable an appreciation of the current andfuture challenges. During the first three decades of planned development, successiveplans emphasized the need for financing development largely from resourcesmobilized domestically.  Firstly, Indian planners shared the export pessimism thenpervading the developing world.  Secondly, the existence of a large domestic marketprovided scope for internalising forward and backward linkages. Thirdly, developmentstrategy hinged upon a programme of industrialization to break through the viciouscircle of backwardness. Fourthly, the availability of foreign exchange was a majorconstraint, especially after the running down of the Sterling balances during the1950s and 1960s. Export pessimism permeated the policy stance throughout theearly decades of our planning.  Accordingly, exports were regarded as a residual, avent-for-surplus on those occasions when such surpluses were available. Importsubstitution was the principal instrument of trade policy and was regarded in the earlyyears as not only the correct strategy but also inevitable in a continental economy likeIndia.8. It may be of interest to note that the objective of self-reliance did not find anexplicit commitment in the second and third five-year plans which were mainlyconcerned with generating the foreign exchange resources required for the plans.The third plan reflected the first signs of rethinking in the policy strategy by dedicatingitself to ‘self-sustaining growth’ which required ‘domestic savings to progressivelymeet the demand of investment and for the balance of payments gap to be bridgedover’. The fourth plan contained an articulated approach to achieving self-reliance.While an export growth of seven per cent per annum was considered an essentialelement of the strategy, it was envisaged that the dependence on foreign aid wouldbe halved during the course of the fourth plan (1969-74). It was in the fifth plan (1974-79) that self-reliance was recognised as an explicit objective.  The sixth plan (1980-85) emphasized the strengthening of the impulses of modernization for theachievement of both economic and technological self-reliance. The seventh plan(1985-90) noted the conditions under which the concept of self-reliance was definedearlier, particularly in the preceding plan. It conceptualized self-reliance not merely interms of reduced dependence on aid but also in terms of building up domesticcapabilities and reducing import dependence in strategic materials. The concept alsoencompassed the achievement of technological competence through liberal imports4of technology. The gulf crisis and its impact on India provided several lessons for us,and one of them was that a relatively closed economy does not provide immunityfrom a foreign exchange crisis. Incidentally, India excelled in managing the crisis andemerged as one of the very few countries in the world, amongst both the developedand the developing, to have never defaulted on its external obligations.9. In the aftermath of the Gulf crisis, policy actions were initiated as part of theoverall macroeconomic management well coordinated to simultaneously achievestabilization and structural change. External sector policies designed to progressivelyopen up the Indian economy formed an integral part of the strategy for structuralreforms. In this context, the Report of the High Level Committee on Balance ofPayments (Dr. Rangarajan Committee, 1993) recommended improvement in exports,both merchandise and invisibles; modulation of import demand on the basis of theavailability of current receipts to ensure a level of current account deficit consistentwith normal capital flows; enhancement of non-debt creating flows to limit the debtservice burden; adoption of market-determined exchange rate; building up the foreignexchange reserves to avoid liquidity crises and elimination of the dependence onshort-term debt.  It is evident that the external sector policies of the 1990s, based onthe Report, paid rich dividends in terms of growth and resilience to a series ofexternal and domestic shocks.10. In the new millennium, however, there has been a dramatic shift in ourapproach to external sector management in tune with the changing circumstances.First, with the emergence of marginal current account surplus, it appears that thesustainability of current account deficit may not be a problem though the deficit ontrade account persists and has been increasing.  Second, the main contributors to thepositive outcome in current account are workers' remittances and export of software,both being a result of process of global integration. Third, the exchange rate regimeas well as external debt management served us well, especially the avoidance ofsovereign debt through commercial borrowings.  The policy regime helped uswithstand several global crises while maintaining a respectable growth. Fourth, themanagement of capital account has acquired the primary focus rather than thecurrent account. Fifth, a judicious integration with the global trade regime hasimparted some competitive efficiency and confidence to the domestic industry andperhaps, even to commercial agriculture though to a limited extent.  Finally, it hasbecome evident that the management of the external sector is closely linked to thedomestic sector and the major thrust of public policy now has to be managing theintegration and not 'grumbling' as the Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen is reported tohave said a couple of days ago.  Integration of the Indian economy with the globaleconomy and policies aimed thereat have to address domestic and external sectorsin a holistic and harmonious way. In brief, we have moved from managing externalsector to implementing an optimal integration of domestic and external sectors, andthe global economy.Adjustments by the global economy11. The debate in India has customarily been on the contours of the public policyin the context of increasing global economic integration.  More recently, however, adebate in the rest of the world has been in evidence on the challenges likely to befaced by the global economy on account of progressively increasing global integrationof the Indian economy.  The emphasis is of course on successful integration whichwill no doubt depend on the appropriateness of our public policies and the private5sector responses. Hence, there is a need to have an ongoing appreciation of how theglobal economy is responding to the challenges of our integration while we moveforward with our own agenda of securing an optimal integration.12. Currently, the major issue in the global economy appears to be the significantbuild up of current account imbalances.  The current account deficit of U.S.A. hasbeen rising and is around 5% of GDP, while current account surpluses are noticed inAsia and to some extent in Latin America and Russia.  The external financing of theUS deficit moved away from equity in the late nineties to debt in the recent years,possibly reflecting a perception of productivity growth in the former period and fiscalstress in the latter.  The official reserves played a greater role than in the past infinancing the US current account deficit in recent years. There is a perception that theUS dollar is still relatively overvalued warranting a correction. Simultaneously, theunique combination of easy monetary policy and lax fiscal policy in majorindustrialised countries is set to end and the financial markets are already in a stateof uncertainty.  Even assuming that the transition of monetary policies to a moreneutral stance is managed well and that trade gets to be more evenly balanced,associated with some corrections in the USA, the simultaneous emergence of Chinaand India with significant competitive strengths in trade in goods as well as serviceswill have to be accommodated by the global economy. Thus, the issue for theimmediate future is that both, correcting current global imbalances and integrating thetwo Asian giants, may have to take place simultaneously in the global economy.13. It is evident that China and India will have to give a high priority to generatingemployment and are poised for substantial increases in productivity.  Consequently,the global economy will have to consider the implications of these developments onprices, exchange rates, wages and structures of employment in industrialisedcountries.  Over the medium term, it is felt that outsourcing will grow in geometricprogression, particularly to India, and may also cover high-end research anddevelopment.  In manufacturing, China has emerged as a leader and India is poisedto join the race.  Though agriculture is heavily subsidised in major industrialisedcountries, such subsidisation could be difficult to sustain from a fiscal point of view,since many of the countries concerned are poised to meet the mounting pensionliabilities not to speak of burgeoning health care costs of maintaining the changingdemographics. One sector where the industrialised economies continue to showconsiderable strength and dominance is the financial sector, partly attributable to theconfidence factor in financial markets that favours the industrialised economies andtraditional international financial centres.  It is essential for us to carefully monitor thedevelopments in both real and financial sectors, and to modulate our policies intandem with the global developments so that global integration continues to be apositive sum game for all the countries.Random thoughts on our policies14. As mentioned, global economic integration is technology induced and,simultaneously, policy constrained or policy restrained – in other words, policy-managed. While the economic integration of India with the global economy willcontinue to take place, a successful integration, with due regard to the interests of avast majority particularly, the poor in our country would be possible only throughsound public policies – evolved and redesigned from time to time.  The key phraseshere are "successful economic integration", and "sound public policies" – bothinvolving processes spread over time and also interaction with global economies.  If6one were to make an informed guess on the prospects of such a successfulintegration of India, it may be said that upside and downside risks are evenlybalanced with a short term bias towards upside risks –  which would give us sometime to work on mitigating the downside risks in the medium term.  Indeed, the well2publicised BRIC report reflects considerable confidence in the future of the Indianeconomy, though it is necessary to see the fine print to realise that while India wouldbe a super power in 2050, "if development proceeds successfully", the per capitaincome would still not be at a high end.  What is important to recognise is that thereport leans on the demographic strength that India derives from its huge workforce.In order to harness the demographic advantages, the quality of labour force, (in termsof relevant skills which need to be sustained, reoriented and upgraded in a globallycompetitive era) and the physical health of the workforce become crucial.  Educationand health, therefore, provide the link between supply and demand for labour throughincreases in productivity. In this background, here are some random thoughts on thepriorities for public policy to ensure successful economic integration of India withglobal economy.First, pragmatic policies in the external sector, particularly in the managementof capital account and exchange rate, have served us well by contributing to growth,resilience to shocks and an overall stability.  There is merit in continuing thepragmatic, cautious and, gradual approach in this regard, subject to improvements infiscal arena and the progress in strengthening the domestic financial sector.Second, the management of financial sector has been oriented towardsgradual rebalancing between efficiency and stability and the changing shares ofpublic and private ownership. Enhanced competition among diverse players,including from branches of foreign banks, has been encouraged. Considerableimprovements have taken place in prudential governance as also in moving awayfrom administrative measures to market-orientation.  Improvements in efficiency andstability are palpable and there is merit in continuing with such rebalancing whilerefocusing on consolidation, governance and moving towards Basel II - albeitgradually, as in the past.Third, on the fiscal front, the ratio of public-debt to GDP is high in our country,but the structure of public-debt displays characteristics that make us less vulnerablethan other countries with similar debt magnitudes.  There is advantage in continuingthe progress in public debt management keeping structural aspects in view. As weproceed with fiscal consolidation, clearly focussed in the latest Union Budget 2004-05, there will be greater flexibility in conduct of monetary policy and greaterconfidence for proceeding with financial sector reforms. Furthermore, an effective andqualitative fiscal adjustment would enhance the scope for a more successfulintegration with the global economy.Fourth, in matters relating to trade, significant liberalisation of external tradehas taken place smoothly, which has imparted competitive efficiency to the domesticsector.  The apprehensions that existed till a few years ago of the adverse impact ofsuch trade liberalisation, have abated and the business confidence in the country hasimproved.  While the gradual approach with a commitment to a liberalised traderegime has enabled productivity increases – almost up to the global best standards inmany of the sectors – there are signs of pick up in investment activity which couldcatalyse the needed demand for credit and create employment.  There is onesignificant incongruity, however, which should be corrected sooner than later, viz., thecontinuing trade restrictions within the country even as there has been progress in                                                2 Wilson, D., Rupa Purushottaman, October 2003, 'Dreaming with BRICS : The Path to 2050',  GlobalEconomics Paper No.99, Goldman Sachs, New York.7liberalising external trade. There is incontrovertible, though generalised, evidence toshow that persisting trade restrictions in a country are not in the public interest andhence, as many distinguished economists plead, most of the exceptions to Article 301of the Constitution permitted on 'public interest' grounds perhaps need to be doneaway with.  (Article 301 reads as `subject to other provisions of this part, trade,commerce, and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free’). This maywarrant repeal of several legislations that restrict trade domestically in the "publicinterest". To alleviate any adverse impact on vulnerable sections, a straight forwardsubsidy could be considered in favour of the poor.  There is another well recogniseddistortion, vestiges of which still continue, in the form of reservation for small scaleindustries. With liberalisation of external trade, it is anomalous to persist with suchdistortions, even if on a reduced scale.  Thus, there is still an unfinished agenda ontrade reforms especially in regard to domestic trade and a policy commitment toremove such distortions in a defined short time frame would be ideal.Fifth, it is interesting to note that the two sectors where India is globally mostcompetitive, namely, software and pharmaceuticals, are not power intensive and donot require bulky transportation. The competitiveness of the manufacturing industry isadmittedly a function of the availability of reliable power supply at reasonable cost.The budget of 2004-05 has rightly emphasised the importance of power, airports andseaports (apart from tourism, which has significant employment potential) but there isneed for implementation at a pace significantly faster than we have ever witnessed inany sector so far.Sixth, there is universal recognition of the need to improve both productivityand output in the agriculture and related activities to meet the objectives of growthand employment. Yet, despite the best of efforts and excellent results achieved in thatdirection, there will have to be a massive shift of the workforce from agriculture tonon-agricultural avocations.  While it is difficult to estimate at this stage, we should beprepared for a large-scale migration of the workforce to the tune of 10 million peryear, from rural to semi-urban and urban areas. The quality of urban infrastructureeven in the metropolitan cities is not conducive to globally competitive economicactivity. The inevitable large scale redeployment of the migrating workforce would,therefore, need institutional arrangements, be they in public or private sector, for skill-imparting and skill up gradation.  In these two matters relating to the workforce, somesupply-led approaches appear to be in order, rather than waiting for the demand to begenerated.Seventh, improvements in institutional infrastructure in matters relating toadministrative, judicial and other systems of governance are admittedly important.Needless to say, if we fail to record rapid progress in these critical areas, we will failin everything, especially in economic arena.Eighth, the quantity and quality of water, education and health careinfrastructure are far from adequate, and are not even at the minimum levelconsistent with a modern society.  These fall under the ambit of delivery of publicservices and the Prime Minister has already accorded a high priority to this issue.Any tangible reform in this area would require action on several fronts, i.e., legislative,executive and judicial and at several levels, Centre, State and local.Ninth, there are regional inequalities in growth and several analysts have triedto find the causes and suggest remedies.  Recognising that the next phase of reformsin most of the physical, social and institutional infrastructure, especially in the area ofdelivery of services, would fall within the realm of the States, one should hope thatthe demonstration effect of a few high-performing States will spur the other States, inthe medium term, to compete for better governance and economic performance.8Finally, enhanced investment activity, particularly in the infrastructure area,would necessitate higher domestic savings, especially in the public sector coupledwith efficient financial intermediation. In addition, foreign savings need to be attractedand absorbed with a strong preference to Foreign Direct Investment in all sectorsthough in some sectors like banking, a calibrated approach may be warranted. At thesame time, our enterprises should be enabled to attain a strong global presence in allsectors. In brief, our global integration has to be a two way process, encompassingmovement of people with some caveats, trade in a free and equitable manner andfinancial integration on a specially sequenced basis. Hence, it is necessary toelaborate on the financial integration.Financial Integration15. From a policy perspective, there are three fundamental issues in regard tofinancial integration namely, "how does financial globalization help growth ?"; "howdoes it impact macro-volatility ?"; and "how can developing countries harness thebenefits of globalization ?".  These three issues have been addressed3comprehensively, in an IMF Occasional Paper and the following extracts from thesummary of the Paper do provide some answers:“There is some evidence of a 'threshold effect' in the relationship betweenfinancial globalization and economic growth.  The beneficial effects of financialglobalization are more likely to be detected when the developing countrieshave a certain amount of absorptive capacity"……… "International financialintegration should, in principle, also help countries to reduce macroeconomicvolatility.  The available evidence suggests that developing countries have notfully attained this potential benefit”.……… "A type of threshold effect appearshere as well – reductions in volatility are observed only after countries haveattained a particular level of financial integration"……….. "The evidencepresented in this paper suggests that financial integration should beapproached cautiously, with good institutions and macroeconomic frameworksviewed as important.  The review of the available evidence does not, however,provide a clear road map for the optimal pace and sequencing of integration.Such questions can best be addressed only in the context of country-specificcircumstances and institutional feature”.The guidance for policy makers from the above is perhaps clear.  Unlike in the caseof trade integration where benefits to all countries are demonstrable, in case offinancial integration, a "threshold" is important for a country to get full benefits.  Ajudgmental view needs to be taken whether and when a country has reached the“threshold” and the financial integration should be approached cautiously with aplausible road map by answering questions in a country-specific context andinstitutional features.  Fortunately, we, in India, have been adhering to a cautious andcalibrated approach in our reforms so far and there is merit in adopting a 'road mapapproach' building on the strengths that we have already developed.16. One of the major concerns for developing countries in proceeding withfinancial integration appears to be the financial stability. Hence, the role of cross-border linkages in this regard should not be ignored.  It would be useful to draw upon                                                3 Prasad E., Kenneth Rogoff, Shang-Jin Wei, and M. Ayhan Kose, 2003, 'Effects of FinancialGlobalisation on Developing Countries: Some Empirical Evidence', IMF Occasional Paper, No.220,Washington DC.94the Introduction in an IMF Working Paper on the subject which identifies four majortrends in the financial economy of the past decades and mentions the following:“Although these trends reflect important advances in finance that havecontributed substantively to economic efficiency, they evidently haveimplications for the nature of financial risks and vulnerabilities and the waythese affect the real economy, as well as for the role of policymakers inpromoting financial stability.  For instance, risk management and diversificationtechniques have, in principle, bolstered the resilience of the financial system,but the expansion of cross-sector and cross-border linkages implies morescope for contagion”.17. It is also necessary to recognise that financial integration complicates theconduct of monetary management. The growing cross-border integration of financialmarkets enables massive movements of capital, which quickly arbitrage interest ratedifferentials across national boundaries.  This is reinforced by the ever-wideningimpact of the information technology revolution.  Real long-term interest rates inindustrialised countries have been converging since the late 1980s.  Financialintegration has also brought with it shocks common to several countries since the"confidence channel" transmits financial crises across countries swiftly.  In a world ofgeneralised uncertainty, monetary policy in several countries is faced with aprogressive loss of discretion.  For developing countries, in particular, considerationsrelating to maximising output and employment weigh equally upon monetaryauthorities as maintaining the price stability.  In considering the pace of financialintegration, the implications of a concurrent loss of a degree of autonomy in conductof monetary policy of a country and the country context should not be lost sight of.The analytics presented in the Report of the Committee on Capital AccountConvertibility (Tarapore Committee, 1997) are very relevant in this regard. Inparticular, they relate to what has been described as 'preconditions' such as fiscalconsolidation and strength of the financial sector, and meeting such preconditionsfacilitates the conduct of monetary policy in a more open capital account regime.18. It is also useful to recognise a close link between the extent of capital accountliberalisation and the presence of foreign financial enterprises in a country.  Thenature of the link is best articulated in the following extracts from a recent book by5Martin Wolf :"It is impossible for such tiny markets to support competition among self-standing national players with realistic aspirations to world-class performance”.(p.285)…………. "For all these reasons, a symbiosis exists between bothcurrent and capital account liberalization and the contribution made by thepresence of foreign financial enterprises in the economy.  This is a secondreason for aspiring to capital account liberalization”. (p.286)…………… "For allthese reasons, therefore, the elimination of controls on capital movement is adesirable objective.  But it is one that also carries substantial risks.  The rightanswer is not to avoid liberalizing for ever, but to carry it through in a carefullythought out and disciplined manner.  In that way, it may be possible to achievethe objectives of integration without the crises that have, so often punctuatedmovement in that direction”.(p.288).                                                4 Houben A., Jan Kakes, and Garry Schinasi, June 2004, 'Towards a Framework for SafeguardingFinancial Stability', IMF Working Paper, No.WP/04/101, Washington DC.5 Wolf M., 2004, Why Globalization Works, Yale University Press, New Haven and London.10Thus, one of the important considerations for encouraging the presence of foreignfinancial enterprises is to ensure adequate and healthy competition. The compulsionto expand foreign enterprises would thus depend on quality of competition that isalready existing in a country.  In any case, the consensus appears to be that processof liberalization in financial sector has to be carefully calibrated and sequenced.Banks and Financial Integration19. The major risks in financial integration that emerging economies face relate tofinancial stability and in this regard the criticality of banks is generally acknowledged,6but is worth reiterating in the words of Martin Wolf :“Banks are the epicentres of financial fragility.  The central role of banks ingenerating the financial feast and famine of the past three decades,particularly in relation to emerging market finance, is entirely predictable.  If weare to manage a financially integrated world better than we have done so far,banks must be more effectively caged in the countries at the core of thefinancial system and those at the periphery”. (p.298)……………….“The fadsand fancies of foolish bankers in the core countries have lain behind most ofthe financial crises of the past three decades.  When elephants stampede,they trample down everything in the way.  That is what happened to LatinAmerica in the 1970s and 1980s and then East Asia in the 1990s.  For thisreason, Dobson and Hubauer have rightly argued that making the world saferrequires changes at both the core and the periphery.  They argue that not onlythe behaviour of the banks but even that of hedge funds is directly related tothe frailty of banking”.  (p.299)It would not be appropriate to conclude from the above that capital market integrationshould not take place.  From a policy perspective, the concluding remarks of Mr.Martin Wolf are very pertinent, and the extract reads as follows:“But, for a host of reasons, emerging-market economies should ultimately planto integrate into the global capital markets, with emphasis on the words`ultimately’ and `plan’”.  (p.304).Foreign banks and financial integration20. It will be useful to narrate the pros and cons of licensing foreign banks in the7, 8emerging economies by drawing liberally from two recent publications .  The prosrelate to (a) increasing and diversifying available funds; (b) enhancing bankingcompetition and efficiency; (c) developing financial markets and market infrastructure;(d) helping with recapitalisation and wider diversification of banks; and (e) reducingsensitivity of the host country banking system to local business cycles and changingfinancial market conditions.  The arguments against foreign banks' entry encompass(i) weakening infant domestic banks; (ii) servicing only the ‘best’ customers andneglect of Small and Medium Enterprises; (iii) likelihood of bringing instability; (iv)concerns that majority of banking assets will become foreign owned; and above all (v)challenges to financial supervisors in the emerging markets.                                                6 Ibid.7 Committee on Global Financial System, 2004, 'Foreign Direct Investment in the Financial Sector ofEmerging Market Economies', Report of a Working Group established by the Committee on GlobalFinancial System, Bank for International Settlements, Basel.8 Song, Inwon, 2004, 'Foreign Bank Supervision and Challenges to Emerging Market Supervisors', IMFWorking Paper, No.WP/04/82, Washington DC.1121. The challenges to emerging market banking supervisors have come to the foreof research agenda now. The policy concerns in the recent years, with increasinglylarge proportion of banking assets accounted for by foreign banks, are welldocumented in the Report of the BIS and the Working Paper referred to above. Theissues relate to (a) licensing policy for foreign banks; (b) monitoring the localestablishments of large international banks; (c) sheer variety and  complexity of newfinancial products including derivatives; (d) familiarisation and understanding of whenand to what extent the overseas parent banking organisations will support their cross-border operations in times of difficulties or crises; (e) managing systemic risksassociated with cross-border banking; (f) the complications arising from theorganisational positioning of the foreign banks that are not necessarily stand-aloneinstitutions but are rather part of a holding company group, and the complexity offinancial institutions active in a number of jurisdictions; and (g) possibility ofincreased operational risks due to integrated operations of consolidated financialinstitutions. While narrating the complexities, the IMF paper makes a reference to thebroadening of supervisory concerns.  "This is a particular concern in the cases whereforeign commercial banks expand their operations rapidly in the area of non-bankfinancial services, such as insurance, portfolio management, and investmentbanking".(p.20).  Hence, in the regulation and supervision of foreign banks, whichhave cross-border operations, the regulators will have to take into account all thesefundamental realities.22. On the basis of anecdotal evidence, and perceptions of supervisors in theemerging countries, some of the practical concerns need to be considered. First,there are occasions when the policy imperatives of the regulators and supervisors donot fully align with the strategic business goals of the banking sector players.  In suchinstances of conflict, it is likely that the interest of domestic banks would be moreclosely aligned with the policy objectives than the interest of the foreign banks.Second, there may be instances when the relationship between a supervisor and thesupervised foreign bank become the subject matter of inter-governmental concernswhich often puts emerging economies in a disadvantageous position. Third, theintimate knowledge that a national supervisor possesses in respect of domesticownership of a domestic bank is normally not available in respect of all foreigninvestors in any bank – domestic bank or foreign bank with presence in the hostcountry.  Fourth, there are concerns about the affiliations between banks andcommercial firms in terms of conflicts of interest and misallocation of credit.  Similarconcerns arise regarding affiliations between non-banking financial companies andbanks as also between non financial companies and banks.  (For example, see TerryJ. Jorde “The future of banking - The Structure and Role of Commercial Affiliations” inthe Symposium hosted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, U.S.A., July,16, 2003).  Fifth, there are several policy issues with regard to liquidity managementthat may arise in the course of wider foreign participation in the financial market in9Asia, which have been well articulated by Eiji Hirano, Assistant Governor of Bank ofJapan.  Two extracts from his Paper would be appropriate to the current context :“The question occurred to me as to whether or not there is an optimal way ofaccepting foreign participation which prevents adverse element of foreignparticipation.  My tentative answer is probably not.  Foreign participationinevitably has double-edged-sword nature, namely a source of stability as wellas instability.  If you expect greater benefits from foreign participation, you                                                9 Hirano Eiji, 2004, 'Policy issues concerning financial sector FDI in Asia : A global financial systemperspective', CGFS Workshop, (mimeo), Seoul.12have to accept greater potential cost.   That is probably thereality"………………. "The corollary of this proposition is that prematureexposure of weak domestic banks to international competitors in domesticmarkets may run the risk of weakening overall systemic stability, which couldhave global implications”.23. There is a recent development which impacts the level playing field betweenforeign banks present in emerging market economies and the domestic banks.thDuring the annual meetings of Bank for International Settlements on 26 June 2004,a formal announcement was made regarding the publication of the revised frameworkfor capital adequacy, known as Basle II, as approved by Group of Ten (G-10)countries.  The studies on quantitative impact of Basel II seem to indicate that theforeign banks operating in emerging economies would require less regulatory capitaland by virtue of their lower capital servicing costs, could finely price their productsand services to the detriment of domestic banks. However, it is too early to assessthe advantage, if any.24. The policy-makers in emerging countries are fully aware of both the benefitsand risks arising out of the presence of foreign banks and indeed foreign capital inbanks, which leads them to impose a variety of forms of restrictions depending on thecircumstances of each country. There are several ways in which restrictions areimposed on foreign ownership in the banking sector, whether through limiting theforeign investment in the domestic banks or the presence of foreign banks.  Presenceof a foreign bank is usually in one of the three recognized forms (viz., a branch,subsidiary or a wholly owned subsidiary) and only a particular form of organisationmay be permitted usually with no choice to the foreign bank. There are somerestraints on the type of business permitted to a foreign bank (such as beingrestricted to foreign currency operations or non-acceptance of retail deposits or otherspecified operations) as also stipulations in regard to the minimum capitalrequirement for a branch or a subsidiary of a foreign bank.  There can also bepractices amongst countries in regard to the aggregate foreign investment permittedin a local bank as also on the maximum holdings by an individual or a corporate entityor an entity controlled by foreign financial institutions in a local bank. Similarly, theregulations in some countries, consistent with the overall plan of financial integration,place an absolute limitation on the size of the total assets or capital of a foreign bank(which would indirectly restrict its total assets).  It needs being borne in mind thatcertain policies in regard to the entry of foreign investors or a foreign bank in acountry may be triggered due to extraordinary circumstances such as a financialcrisis or as a part of a structured crisis management package. There are instanceswhere as a part of response to banking crises, a higher level of initial foreignownership have been permitted but with stipulations for dilution subsequently.Furthermore, certain countries which, ab initio, did not have any private sectorbanking might welcome the presence of foreign banks.  Similarly, expectations ofjoining a regional bloc, say European Union, might result in welcoming of a largerpresence of foreign banks.25. The extent of foreign investment, the nature of such investment, theappropriate form of presence and the profile of actual players in the banking sectorare usually prescribed by the supervisors taking into account the multiple challengesfaced in a given country context including the extent of financial integration sought tobe achieved.  In brief, each country picks up an appropriate package that isnecessitated by the circumstances, which ensures the presence of foreign investors13that fully satisfy the `fit and proper’ criteria, and that the presence of foreign banks isin the best national interest.  It is noteworthy that our policy in regard to foreign banksis a part of the planned strategy for rebalancing efficiency and stability in the financialsystem.26. In this background, what should be the policy considerations governing thepresence of foreign banks?   First, the issue is not one of being for or against theforeign banks since financial integration necessitates their presence – be it in theindustrialised or in the developing countries.  There are, however, special problems inthe case of emerging market economies which have not reached the “threshold” to beable to minimise the downside risks of the foreign banks' presence.  These are keysupervisory and regulatory issues which arise as a result of greater foreignparticipation in the domestic financial system. Hence, policy-makers, including thefinancial sector supervisors, have to carefully craft a road map to ultimately integratethe domestic financial sector globally while also moving towards the “threshold”based on perceptions of the international financial system and on domestic economicconditions.  Second, quite often it is not a question of whether to have the presenceof foreign banks, but, to what extent, under what conditions, over what time horizonand in what form – usually a particular form of presence being preferred.  A moredifficult question, especially in regard to foreign investors in local banks, is the identityand the nature of investors - recognising that an absolute majority of portfolio flowsoriginate in tax havens.  The problem is, however, less complex in regard to highlyrated banks.  Finally, there are pros and cons in any package of policy in regard toforeign banks. The weight to be attached to each of the pro and the con is country-specific, judgmental and evolving. Hence, a degree of transparency, a road map andconsiderable flexibility to the supervisors to exercise judgment on several aspects ofentry and presence of foreign banks appear to be the desirable components of anappropriate policy framework in this regard.Our approach27. India’s approach to financial sector reforms, in general, and to themanagement of the external sector, in particular, has served the country well, interms of aiding growth, avoiding crises, enhancing efficiency and imparting resilienceto the system.  The development of financial markets has been, by and large, healthy.The basic features of the Indian approach are gradualism; co-ordination with othereconomic policies; pragmatism rather than ideology; relevance to the context;consultative processes; dynamism and good sequencing so as to be able to meet theemerging domestic and international trends.  In order to facilitate an understanding ofthe approach, a few illustrations would be in order.  Convertibility on current accountwas announced in 1994 by the Government and the exchange control restrictionswere removed over a period of time, emphasising the need for underlying realtransactions and reasonableness of amounts. However, the repatriation andsurrender requirements still dominate the system, though some people aver that it isinconsistent with the concept of current account convertibility.  The intention to moveover to capital account convertibility was announced in 1997 and its achievement isstill an ongoing process – which differentiates the roles of individuals, corporates andfinancial intermediaries. Likewise, in regard to Primary Dealers (PDs), initially in 1996only the PDs promoted by local banks or financial institutions were licensed.  Foreignbank-sponsored PDs were licensed after about three years.  In the banking system,diversified ownership of public sector banks has been promoted over the years andthe performance of their listed stocks in the face of intense competition indicatesimprovements in the system.  They do co-exist with several old and new private14sector banks, and some of the new private sector banks have proved to be of globalstandards.  Recently, some of private sector banks promoted by domestic financialinstitutions have been permitted to conduct Central and State Government businesssupplementing the public sector banks. In February 2004, transparent guidelineswere issued by RBI in regard to the prior acknowledgement from RBI for anyacquisition / transfer of shares of a private sector bank which would take theaggregate shareholding of an individual or a group to equivalent of five percent ormore of the paid up capital of the bank.  While this requirement already existed,transparency was imparted by the guidelines.  On July 2, 2004, a comprehensivepolicy framework for ownership and governance in private sector banks has beenplaced in the public domain, by the RBI in the form draft guidelines, for wider publicdebate. Based on the feedback received, a second draft of the guidelines would beprepared and put in public domain for further discussions.28. Foreign banks have been operating in India for decades with a few of themhaving operations in India for over a century.  Quite a few foreign banks from diversecountries set up operations in India during the mid-1990s following the liberalisationof the Indian economy.  The number of foreign bank branches in India has increasedsignificantly in recent years since a number of licences were issued by RBI - wellbeyond the commitments made to the World Trade Organisation.  Although foreignbanks can operate in India only by way of branch presence, some of the foreignbanks have established several subsidiaries in the form of either Non BankingFinance Companies or limited companies in the non financial sector in India thatundertake diverse businesses such as dealing in securities, leasing and finance,information technology, etc.29. The presence of foreign banks in India has benefited the financial system byenhancing competition, resulting in higher efficiency.  There has also been transfer oftechnology and specialised skills which has had some “demonstration effect” asIndian banks too have upgraded their skills, improved their scale of operations anddiversified into other activities.  At a time when access to foreign currency funds wasa constraint for the Indian companies, the presence of foreign banks in India enabledlarge Indian companies to access foreign currency resources from the overseasbranches of these banks. Creating inter-bank markets in money and foreignexchange is a challenge in several developing countries.  In India, however, thepresence of foreign banks, as borrowers in the money market and their operations inthe foreign exchange market, resulted in the creation and deepening, in terms of bothvolumes and products, of the inter-bank money market and forex market though byvirtue of their skills and resources, the foreign banks tend to dominate in somefinancial markets.  In the days ahead, the challenge for the supervisors would be tomaximise the advantages and minimise the disadvantages of the foreign banks' localpresence by synchronising the emerging dominance of their local operations with theprogress in the domestic financial markets as well as in liberalisation of capitalaccount.30. In terms of the Press Note No.2 (2004 Series) issued by the Ministry ofCommerce and Industry on March 5, 2004, the FDI limit in private sector banks wasraised to 74% under the automatic route, including the investment made by FIIs.Foreign banks, according to the Press Note, will be permitted to have either branchesor subsidiaries, not both.  They may operate in India through only one of the threechannels viz., (i) branch/es; (ii) a wholly owned subsidiary; or (iii) a subsidiary; withaggregate foreign investment up to a maximum of 74% in a private bank.  The Press15Note mentioned that the guidelines in this regard will be issued by the Reserve Bankof India.  Reserve Bank is currently examining various options for strengthening thefinancial sector, in general, and the banking sector, in particular, concurrent with thewell-calibrated de-regulation process already set in motion.  The liberalisationmeasures would need to take into account several imperatives, such as,consolidation of domestic banking sector; restructuring of Development FinanceInstitutions; and appropriate timing for the significant entry of foreign banks so as tobe co-terminus with the transition to greater capital account convertibility while beingconsistent with our continuing obligation under the WTO commitments.  It is alsonecessary to examine several issues relating to implementation of the Press NoteNo.2 not in isolation but as part of overall reform paradigm of the banking sector.  Inrespect of foreign banks, issues include : choice of the mode of presence, acceptabletransition path, according national treatment, addressing supervisory concerns,linkages between foreign banks and their presence in other (non-banking) financialservices and the timing of various measures as per a road map to be drawn up.Reserve Bank intends to formulate the guidelines, through an ongoing process ofconsultation, as in the past. The proposed guidelines in this regard are expected tocarry forward the process of financial integration of India in a carefully calibrated andtransparent manner.32. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Let me wish you all the best in your careers;and, that would ensure that my grand children will also be the beneficiaries of ahappier India.---------------
