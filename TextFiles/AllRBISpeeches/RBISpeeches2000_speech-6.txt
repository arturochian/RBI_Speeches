*I have many reasons for being delighted to be participating in the Swarna Mahotsavam ofVivek Vardhini College. I must appreciate the persuasive skills of Principal Dr. Pushpavathi forbringing me here. Being a Hyderabadi, I have several distinguished colleagues and friends whoare faculty and alumni of Vivek Vardhini College. The founding fathers of Vivek Vardhini werereal visionaries who were pioneers in projecting a genuine Indian slant to education; we mustremember that This college was the first to be affiliated to Osmania University, where I was subsequently aresearch scholar, and teacher. As one who studied in Telugu medium schools, there is a specialaffinity for me with the Vivek Vardhini Education Society. The Society was established in 1907,as a bold and visionary venture. The list of institutions of the Society range from primary schoolto post graduate college and also from tailoring to music with medium of instruction in Marathi and of course, English. The sheer range of activities undertaken by the society conveysthe mission of the society. The Swarna Mahotsavam, or the Golden Jubilee celebrations are, asthe society mentions “not only a commemoration but also an occasion for the College torededicate itself to the goal of Vidya Vyapthi, i.e., spread of education with social commitment”.Perhaps, it is, therefore, appropriate to reflect this spirit in my address today by speaking of thepast performance of our economy and explore prospects for the future.The address will briefly touch upon how the economy performed in the pre-Independence era, todemonstrate the virtual stagnation and considerable fluctuations in the living conditions due tofamines and epidemics. The post-Independence period, commencing from the inception ofplanning in 1950 to the onset of Gulf crisis in 1990 was characterised by a massive improvementover pre-Independence performance coupled with some avoidable inadequacies, particularly, interms of incentives and institutional structures and punctuated with droughts, wars and oil-crisis.I will then also cover, somewhat briefly, the performance of our economy during the 'ninetieswhich demonstrates rapid recovery from a deep crisis and a dramatic upward shift inexpectations of levels of growth and greater resilience to withstand shocks. The daunting task oftackling poverty and misery remains a significant problem a whole half a century afterAs we enter the new Millennium, we should frankly assess where we are - - othercountries in terms of various indicators, such as growth, stability and poverty. The major part ofmy address will, therefore, be on India in a global context, with reference to four sets ofindicators viz., economic, institutional, be derived from an understanding of what these indicators with all the known limitations signifyfor us. In a way, I am juxtaposing historical and cross-sectional perspective in the current contextand, on this basis I hope to share with you, my perception of the performance and prospectsbefore us as we move towards 2020. I believe that the advantage of this method of presentation isthat, each of you can draw your own inferences and develop your own perceptions. The tabulardata are appended to the text of this lecture. My purpose would be served if you are provokedinto questioning and thinking about the future, which of course includes preeminently the futureIndependence : 1900-471Pre-of each one of us.infrastructural and social. The concluding part would thusvis a visindependence.Telugu,Vardhini thrived merely on the strength of its excellence. Vivek Friends,Economy : 1950; 2000; 2020 Indian It would serve the purpose of today’s deliberations if one looks at  a few facts brought out bySivasubramonian (1998) on performance of Indian economy during the pre-Independence era of century.First, real Gross Domestic Product ( GDP) which is broadly the national cake, or the total sum ofall the final goods and services produced within the geographical boundary of our country, grewonly  by an average of 0.9 per cent per annum. But, the individual share of this national cake, i.e.,the real per capita GDP grew even lower at an average rate of  0.1 per cent. Real per capita which stood at . 224 in 1900-01 increased, if it can be called an increase, to only Rs. 233 onSecond, even this very low growth was associated with considerable fluctuations due to numberof years of drought and famine and epidemics. Thus, aggregate GDP declined in 17 out Third, after 1920, epidemics however, were better controlled and some improvement wasperceivable in health services. The infant mortality rate was on an average 205 out of 1000 in1911 and, this also declined to 136 in 1946. Every Indian was expected to live for 23.8 years atFourth, during the second decade of the century, on an average 535 grams of food was availableFifth, in 1901, 94 out of every 100 Indians could neither read nor write. By 1941, this had gonedown to a mere 85.Sixth, no doubt the manufacturing sector had grown at 4.0 per cent per annum. Goods carriedand passenger miles by Indian railways also increased by six times. Communications andgovernment services also maintained moderate growth rates. But as the economy was primarilyan agricultural economy, the progress in these areas could not make any worthwhile impact onIndependence : 1950-1990After Independence, the country embarked on an ambitious task of planned economic growth tomove the country out of the critical stagnation in the pre-Independence era. The country had toalso reckon with the after effects of the Second World War, and Partition, in addition toconsolidating the nation and building an administrative and political apparatus. As these complextasks were being tackled, the country had to face famines and wars during the ‘sixties and the‘seventies – apart from the oil crisis of early ‘seventies and early ‘eighties. These factors shouldbe kept in view while considering the facts that would be narrated now.First, the real GDP growth rose from 0.9 per cent in pre-Independence era to an average annualrate of about 4.0 per cent. Significant acceleration of growth rate took place in the ‘eighties. Infact, the growth during the ‘eighties, at an annual average rate of 5.9 per cent bettered the worldoutput growth of 3.3 per cent, that of developing countries at 4.3 per cent, and even that of Asiaexcluding China and India at 5.1 per cent.Second, as compared with the pre-Independence era, the fluctuations were relatively less and theGDP was steady in all the years disregarding four years Third, while the growth was a remarkable improvement as compared to that of pre-Independencedays, the surge in population growth to an annual average rate of over 2.0 per cent, could raisethe per capita  by about 2.0 per cent per annum only, though this is twenty times the growthin pre-Independence era. In fact, the annual growth in per capita   in the ‘eighties was over3.5 per cent.GDPGDPGDP202characterised by crisis. growth in Post-the overall situation in the economy.per Indian per day.

Importantly, the sector became lessdependent on the vagaries of the monsoon.Sixth, industry grew at an annual average rate of over 5.5 per cent. Importantly, with the settingup of large-scale and heavy industries, the industrial base expanded rapidly thereby laying thebase for sustained industrial growth. Services also grew by about 5.0 per cent and it was close to6.0 per cent since the second half of the ‘seventies. Sectoral composition of GDP graduallychanged. Agriculture which contributed to more than half of GDP during the first three five-yearplans decreased its share to about one-third around the end of the ‘eighties. On the other hand,services improved its share from about one-third to more than two-fifth. Industry’s share alsoSeventh, the post-Independence period witnessed a marked rise in the rate of saving (asproportion of GDP). It rose from an average of about 11.9 per cent during the first one and halfdecades to a little over 20.0 per cent during the ‘eighties. Rate of investment also rose from 13.7Eighth, in terms of inflation record, the price rise was low at 1.2 per cent during the first decadeafter Independence. This rose to 6.3 per cent during the ‘sixties and further to 9.0 per cent duringthe ‘seventies. During the ‘eighties it was around 8.0 percent.While all the above indicators of growth are remarkable achievements, particularly over the  pre-Independence days, many of our goals that we set out to achieve did not materialise. There are atFirst, on the income front, the aim of doubling the average real per capita income by the end ofSecond, despite all the economic growth and the attempt to tackle the problem head-on, poverty,broadly defined as people unable to incur expenditure to meet the required  minimum calorieintake per day of 2400 in rural areas and 2100 in urban areas, continued to remain  unacceptablyThird, even by 1990 we could not make little less than half the population (48 per cent) either toFourth, infant mortality rate declined, to 80 per 1000 in 1990 as compared with 136 per 1000prior to Independence. On an average, life expectancy in 1990 was about 60 years. In 1989-90, aquarter of our people did not have any access to safe water and as much as 87 per cent did nothave any sanitation facility. During the second half of the ‘eighties, for every 2,520 Indians,Fifth, even though we set out to achieve self-reliance in the external sector, we facedconsiderable pressures on the balance of payments. Exports in US $ terms grew below 5.0 percent during the first two decades and the first half of the ‘eighties while imports grew faster.Only during the ’seventies and the latter part of the ‘eighties, particularly during the formerperiod, was the export growth impressive by our own past records. But then, in the ‘seventiesalso, imports outpaced exports. In the international context, we were marginalised as India’sexports which were about 2.0 per cent of world exports at the beginning of the ‘fifties went3below 0.5 per cent by the end of the ‘eighties.there was only one doctor available, while only one nurse was available to 1,700 Indians.read or to write.

These problems arose in the form of structural rigidities, lack ofcompetition both at home and abroad, poor performance of public sector enterprises, lack offiscal prudence and an  incentive framework inconsistent with productivity gains.An importantfactor propelling the growth during this period was the rapid rise in government expenditure,reflecting in the fiscal deficit jumping from 4.0 per cent of GDP in the ‘seventies to 8.33 per centin the crisis year of 1991. The problem was not just the size of fiscal deficit, but the fact thatthere was also a revenue deficit, since the assets such as public enterprises created out ofborrowings did not yield adequate returns. The high fiscal deficit also got reflected in theemergence of a current account deficit during the ‘eighties which peaked at 3.2 per cent of in 1991. Recourse was taken to external debt, often on commercial terms, and a large amountwith short maturity. In some ways, the high growth of 1980s was facilitated by growth in internaland external debt or borrowed money and borrowed time. Thus, triggered by the Gulf-crisis, asevere balance of payment crisis had to be faced in 1991 that made introduction ofGulf-Crisis and In the aftermath of the payment crisis of 1991, a number of measures were undertaken to removethe structural rigidities afflicting various sectors of the economy. For instance, industriallicensing has been done away with to improve the efficiency of markets; extensive reforms havebeen undertaken in the financial sector and a more effective system of regulation and supervisionhas been put in place; cautious liberalisation has been undertaken in the external sector ;  the wayin which fiscal transactions have impinged on the financial sector has been altered so as tocontain the monetisation of the deficit, thereby giving the Central Bank some elbow room toimplement monetary policy. The prime aim of these measures was to bring about increasedcompetition, both domestically and externally, and reduce rent seeking activities. All thesemeasures have brought about some positive changes in the macroeconomic scenario, thoughFirst, we find that the annual rate of growth of GDP was around 6.1 per cent during the ‘nineties.The post-reform growth i.e., excluding the years of crisis and adjustment (1991-92 and 1992-93)with lower rates Second, the fluctuations in GDP growth were minimal, and except in the Gulf-crisis year of1991-92, the rate of growth of GDP was above 5.0 per cent in all the years. The growthperformance was maintained in the face of unprecedented domestic political uncertainties andexternal uncertainties like the sanctions imposed, border tensions, Asian crisis and steepincreases in oil prices, though from a low base. Fluctuations in output of agriculture were alsomoderate.Third, the per capita GDP increased at an annual average rate of about 4.25 per cent during theWe also find that gross domestic saving as percentage of GDP crossed 22.0 per cent in all thepost-reform years as against only twice during the previous 40 years. In fact, the ratio was closeto, or even crossed, 25.0 per cent in number of years. The gross domestic investment as aGDP4‘nineties.of  growth, was placed at 6.8 per cent as against 5.9 per cent in the ‘eighties.several concerns have been expressed.Reform : 1990-2000programme of reforms inevitable. comprehensive ‘eighties it was not conducive to continued accelerated growth.percentage of GDP also rose to 26.0 to 27.0 per cent in number of years as against over 24.0 perInflation, on the other hand, rose at an annual average rate of 8.9 per cent during 1990-98 andwas higher than the annual average rate of 8.0 per cent  during the ‘eighties. However, duringIn the external sector, external debt to GDP ratio came down from 41.0 per cent in 1991-92 to23.5 per cent in 1998-99. The debt service payments as a ratio to current receipts continued toimprove steadily from 30.2 per cent in 1991-92 to 18.0 per cent in 1998-99. The average annualrate of growth of exports of goods and services of 11.3 per cent during 1990-99 has beenmarkedly above the average of 8.1 per cent in the ‘eighties. The current account deficit (CAD)remained on an average well below 2.0 per cent of GDP in all the years after the Gulf-crisis andin fact also fell to 1.0 per cent of GDP in 1998-99. It must be noted that this period witnessedThus, during the ‘nineties, we accumulated over US $ 30 billion of foreign currency assets, whilereducing external debt and liberalizing trade and maintaining consistently high rate of growth inGDP.Though we have seen tangible improvement on the economic front, I must at this juncture alsoemphasise on the social dimension, which is a more important ingredient of economicdevelopment.First, as per NSS surveys, over 1/3 of the population in 1997 still could not have the requiredSecond, during 1990-96, 19 Indians out of  every 100 did not have access to safe drinking watersources and 84 did not have any access to sanitation showing little improvement from that of1990.Third, infant mortality rate of 70 per 1000, life expectancy of 63 years and daily per capitaFourth, there is evidence that the acceleration in growth is concentrated among some regionsFinally, the savings of public sector as a whole viz., government and public enterprises combinedis close to zero. The size of borrowing as well as cost of borrowings by government isIn brief, there was a significant improvement in terms of growth and stability as well as positionin regard to external sector in the ‘nineties while several concerns especially in regard to povertyand social welfare remained. Indeed, a growth rate of five per cent, which was considered anachievement till a decade ago is considered a sign of failure of policy now, and this reflects theThere have been several indices and ranking exercises undertaken by various internationalranking or rating agencies. These indices have gained importance in the context of globalizationand countries are often ranked for purpose specific reasons on these indices. A cursory look atthese indices will help us understand where India stands with respect to peers as well asdeveloped countries. Greater details on the ranking, composition and methodology of index, etcare given in the Annexures. For this presentation, the indices are broadly classified under fourmajor heads: a) economic indicators; b) institutional indicators; c) infrastructural indicators ; andd) social indicators. Selection of indices was governed by the mere accident of availability andits relevance. Thus, they are tentative and illustrative, and certainly not conclusive.

In per capita terms, however, we are among the lowest in the world,irrespective of the measure. In 1999, India’s Gross National Product (GNP), which is the sumtotal of all the factor incomes accruing to Indian citizen, stood at US $ 442.2 billion and ranked in the world. What each Indian on an average could get from this total, i.e., the per capitaGNP, was only US $ 450 and ranked   in the world which was the lowest among the 9countries in our group. But this GNP is calculated on the basis of market exchange rate i.e., therate at which $ exchange for Rupees in the market. Some analysts question this methodology onthe count that there are differences in the prices of comparable goods, which are not tradedamongst countries. Therefore, market exchange rate cannot value these goods properly. Whenthese differences are adjusted, we get what is called as GNP measured in Purchasing PowerParity (PPP) terms. In this measure, India’s GNP rises to US $ 2144.1 billion and is behind onlyUSA, China and Japan. The per capita GNP also rises to US $ 2149. Even then, India was still in the world, higher than only one country among these 9 countries.It should be noted that as mentioned already, India’s growth  performance has been impressive,and in particular, annual average growth rate of GDP during the ‘eighties and the ‘nineties wasrivaled by few like Singapore and China. In other words, despite the higher GDP growth duringthe last two decades, India continued to remain low in the league of per capita GNP. The culprits,is well known of course, are the size and the rate of growth of population in our country, and thebase  of income with which we started.Savings and investment rates of 20.3 per cent and 23.9 per cent, respectively, during 1997-99,have been comparable or were even better than many developing and developed countries. Butthese rates were much lower than high growth countries like Singapore (savings rate of 51.4 percent and investment rate of 34.5 per cent) and China (savings rate of 42.5 per cent andinvestment rate 38.8 per cent).  Almost all the savings in India are from the household and theprivate corporate sectors. The savings in the public sector, during 1993-94 to 1998-99 averagedjust around 1.0 per cent only. It is noteworthy that, the main reason for low savings in India liesIt may also be noted that growth of exports of goods and services at an annual average rate of11.3 per cent during the ‘nineties was impressive and only lower than the high performers likeChina (13.0 per cent) and Mexico (14.3 per cent). The external debt to The flow of foreign direct investment ( FDI) in India also increased during the ‘nineties andreached US $ 2.26 billion in 1998, which was among the 20 largest FDI recipients among thedeveloping countries. Yet, the level of inflow was still far lower than countries like Singaporend162116(US $ 7.22 billion), China (US $ 45.5 billion and Mexico (US $ 10.24 billion).in 1998 was also much lower than that of Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Mexico.GDP ratio of 23.0 per centin government savings being negative on account of revenue deficits.low ranked 153rdthrd thEconomic IndicatorsUSA and Japan.To reflect dynamic elements of the economy, reference may also be made to several indicesrelating to country-risk, technology, economic creativity, competitiveness, globalization,  expectation, etc.In the composite International Country Risk Guide ( ICRG), risk rating, which is an overall indexof investment risk in a country, as of  March 2000, India with a rating of 64.3 was placed betterthan two of the nine countries in the group. The same is more or less true for the institutionalIn the context of globalization, technology is the propeller of growth. How active is theinvolvement of India in technological innovation and in the import of technology from abroad?And how conducive is the environment in India for business start-ups? World Economic Forum( WEF) captures the former by ‘Technology Index’ and the latter by ‘Start-up Index’. When thesetwo indices are combined, an index is derived, which is called ‘Economic Creativity Index’ thatgets reflected in the growth performance of a country. Out of the 59 countries surveyed in 2000,thIndia was ranked 38 in all the three indices and was placed higher than that of China (48 ).Though business start-up environment in Mexico is worse than India and that of  Japanmarginally more favorable than that of India, their involvement in technological innovations isWEF also prepares another index called ‘Growth Competitiveness Index’ ( GCI) to measure thefactors that contribute to future growth of per capita income of an economy in order to explainwhy some countries are improving faster than others. In 2000, out of 59 countries, India was placed low at 49 position. Countries like China, Mexico and South Africa were placed higherbut their ranks were at 41 , 43Besides the macroeconomic factors, the microeconomic foundation i.e., operating practices andstrategies of firms and the environment in which these firms compete are important for economicdevelopment. The ‘Microeconomic Competitiveness Index’ (MCI) for 1999 by WEF, whichcaptures the above again places India low at 42 position out of 58 countries surveyed.However, India is placed higher than China at 49 position. Mexico (34 ) and South Africa(26 ) are placed much higher.What factors then underpin high current productivity and current economic performance ofIndia? WEF captures these factors by its ‘Current Competitiveness Index’ ( CCI). For 2000, Indiawas at 37 position out of 58 countries, must higher than the GCI rank of 49 position.Interestingly, unlike GCI rank, our CCI rank was higher than China (44 ) and Mexico (42 ),reflecting that factors determining our current growth are better than these countries though notthe factors, which contribute to future growth. Nevertheless, we are still at the lower end of the‘Emerging Market Index’ measures the market openness of a country. Our  index at 46 in theyear 2000 was higher than only China. With regard to integration with the rest of the world,which is captured by ‘Globalization Index’, our rate of integration during 1993-97 was at about2.0 per cent per annum which was at the slower end. But in ‘ Recessionary Expectations Index’which indicates the extent of confidence that a country will not go into slump, our economy wasplaced quite high in 2000, higher than China, Mexico and even USA and Japan.

The index is called ‘Corruption Perception Index’. In it’s 1996 survey, ofth the 54 countries ranked by transparency, India was placed at the  position or as the 9 mostOn governance, the World Bank in its publication India - Reducing Poverty, Development (2000 ) has brought out 5 broad indicators. They are: a) government effectivenessand stability, which include institutional and government stability and general public’ssatisfaction with the government policies; b) role of law and business environment, whichinclude corruption/kickbacks, law and order, legal rights, etc.; c) general public administrationjudged by quality of bureaucracy, its strength and exposure to political interference andaccountability; d) public finance, which among others, includes quality of budget, efficiency andequity of expenditure and receipts and management of public finances; and e) outcomes, inwhich most of the social indicators like poverty, mortality, literacy, etc are included. India’sranking on these indicators against 5 groups of countries in 1995 is available. The groupscompared are : the developing countries; some selected large countries comprising - China,Mexico, South Africa, Brazil and Poland; South East Asia comprising– Indonesia and Thailand;South Asia excluding India; and industrial countries represented by the U.K. and the U.S.In the effectiveness of government and its stability, India fares worse than all groups With regard to the role of law and business environment, India is placed better than itsneighboring South Asian countries. But, in comparison to the group of selected large countriesExcept for the industrial countries, our general public administration is ranked higherBoth the group of industrial countries and the selected large countries have better publicfinance  than ours, but we are better than the rest of the other groups.In the outcomes, however, which are primarily reflected in socio-economic indicators,India fares badly as compared to all the groups.Transport, power, telecommunicat ions, water, sanitation, etc., are part of what we knowas infrastructure which is essential for sustained economic development. These facilities enablesmooth and efficient transaction of economic activities and also help in providing the basicnecessities of life. Here, I would be primarily comparing India with our group of countries on thelevel of individual indicators.Let me start with power. In 1997 ,  the power consumption per capita in India was a mere363 kwh. Though this compares favorably with Pakistan and Sri Lanka, it was far behind theother countries. China consumed almost double the level of India. Typical of South Asiancountries, we also wasted lot of power on transmission and distribution, which was 18.0 per centwaste was only 8.0 per cent.The percentage of our roads in good condition or paved roads in 1998 was only 45.7 percent. Pakistan (57.0 per cent) and Sri Lanka (95.0 per cent) have a much higher percentage ofpaved roads.468in 1997 while in China the Infrastructural Indicatorsthan all other groups of countries.and the industrial countries, India is worse-off.countries.ofAcceleratingcorrupt country among these countries.thselected indicators of governance.The railway network in India is fairly good. In 1998, for every million $ of GDP (PPP), railwaytransported 137.1 thousand ton-km. This was larger than Japan (101.7). However, in comparisonto China (304.8) and South Africa (283.3) with large land area, who also rely more on railwaysIn 1997, 121 out of 1000 Indians had radios, and all barring one in the group are farahead. The position in Sri Lanka (209) was about double of India. Only 68 Indians out 1000 hadTV sets, by far the lowest in the group.With 22 telephone mainlines in 1998, we were only marginally better than one country in thegroup and China (70) was far ahead of us. And, on an average, the waiting time in India for atelephone connection was one year, which was better than only two countries, but stood nowhere There were 2.7 Personal Computers available to every 1000 Indians in 1998, behind allthe countries in the group. In China it was 8.9, while others were far ahead. Similar was thepicture for internet hosts per 10,000 which was 0.23 in India in 2000  compared to China (0.57),Pakistan (0.34) and Sri Lanka (0.63).India is known for its vast pool of scientific personnel and engineers. There were 149such people involved in Research and Development (R & D) per every million Indian during1987-97. Barring one, even in this field, other countries were in a better position. The picturemay not vary significantly even if we reckon the Indian engineers and scientists who havemigrated. During the same period, 5.0 per cent of manufacturing exports was technology related,Safe water sources and sanitation are also basic infrastructural needs to improve thehealth condition of the people. As we shall see in the social indicator, India has not done well onthis front also.Going by some of these infrastructural indicators above, it is not surprising to find that in the1998 Global Competitiveness Report by WEF, India was rated 53 out of the 53 countriesBank , 2000).not  only  access to food, shelter and clothing but also theknowledge and health of the people. A comparison of some of these indicators along with twoindices viz., ‘Human Development Index’ and ‘Human Poverty Index’ among our select groupAn important social indicator in any country is the literacy of its people. In 1998, the adultliteracy rate in our country was 55.7 per cent only and better than  Pakistan (44.0 per cent) butfar below Sri Lanka (91.1) and China (82.8). The picture is the same  with respect to  youthliteracy, which was 71.0 per cent as against 96.5 in Sri Lanka and 97.2 per cent in China. But, itis noteworthy that during 1995-97, public expenditure on education as percentage of GDP at 3.2per cent was comparable to many countries. Also, during 1994-97, despite our higher illiteracyrate, within the education expenditure, we have spent a lower percentage  of 66.0 per cent at thelevel of pre-primary, primary and secondary level. For example, Pakistan and Sri Lanka spentabout 3/4 or more on this level of education.Besides education, health is a basic necessity of life. Though 81.0 per cent of our people during1990-96 had access to safe water sources we were better off only in comparison to three othercountries. And in  sanitation, with just 16.0 per cent of the people having access to it, we wereworse-off as compared to all these countries in the group.9thof countries would be revealing.Social indicators would include Social Indicatorssurveyed in the context of infrastructure (World rdwhich was behind all other countries, except the South Asian neighboring countries.in comparison to China where it was just one month.for transportation of goods, it was far less.70 infants out of every 1000 died in India in 1998.

We also spent a much lower percentage of GDP (0.60 per cent) on health services in 1990-98 than other countries have spent.During 1992-95, there were 48 doctors available to every lakh Indians, better than Sri LankaThe World Bank prepares a composite index called ‘Human Development Index’ ( HDI) tomeasure the average achievement in basic human development. The index comprises ‘Per capitaGDP (PPP) Index’, ‘Education Index’ and ‘Life Expectancy Index’ considered to be the threebasic essentials of life. As one would expect based on the discussion above, in 1998, only onecountry in our group was worse than our position in the first two sub-indices, and only one otherin 1998 in the third index. Not surprisingly, India’s HDI ranking out of 174 countries in 1998.The World Bank also prepares an index called ‘Human Poverty Index’ ( HPI). As against HDI,this index measures the extent of deprivation, rather than development, in the three essentialdimensions of human life reflected in HDI. In the ranking of this index as of 1998, for 85developing countries, we were at the 58One can see that in terms of rate of growth, we have done better in the latter half of the century than during the first half, and far better in the final two decades.  Over the period,fluctuations in growth of output have been reduced. The resilience to withstand shocks hasprogressively increased.  External sector has become comfortable in the sense that there is noforeign currency constraint on growth now.  Yet, we have pervading poverty, high illiteracy andpoor condition of health and sanitation.  There are islands of excellence like informationtechnology experts amidst a sea of depravation and misery. Clearly, economic policy, especiallyof ‘nineties has removed several constraints on economic growth, which is in itself anachievement and a necessary condition for the rest of the goals of a civil society.  But, there arelurking doubts on whether we are systematically building a system that would ensure continuedhigh level of growth and, achievement of minimum social objectives associated with suchgrowth.  Perhaps, India’s rank in the indicators that have been scanned will give a clue as to whatwe should do to dispel the doubts about the future.Economic indicators show that we are one of the fastest growing ec onomies now, withhigh savings and investment ratios coupled with a respectable level of productivity as evidencedby capital output ratios.  External sector is comfortable, though with relatively low level ofcapital inflows – a reflection as much of lack of interest of overseas investors as of ambivalentattitude domestically.  Our position in ‘Current Competitiveness Index’ shows confidence in ourgrowth performance in the short run.  However, our position in ‘Growth Competitiveness Index’indicates a less optimistic picture in the future growth of per capita income.  The position inregard to other related indicators also gives rise to a feeling that factors contributing to current2010How Are We Poised?thHow We Progressed position.thwas 128, thonly.Africa (242.7) only.lower life expectancy than India (63 years).growth are relatively stronger than those contributing to future growth, unless strong policyactions are initiated soon.  At the same time, there is impressive confidence that our economyInstitutional indicators may provide some answer to this difference in percep tion betweenimmediate and medium term to long-term prospects.  The evidence is subjective and hence notvery reliable, but the high rank in corruption is of concern. More disturbing is the perception thateffectiveness of government  is low.  As regards the role of law and business environment, thepicture is satisfactory but does not, as per current indications, appear to assure an environmentfor a high growth path.  The government, law, and business environment are only means to anend, the end being socio-economic well-being of the people.  The critical part is in the outcomesYet another significant set of indicators relevant for medium term prospects relate toinfrastructure. India seems to score rather poorly in regard to energy, say in terms of power-consumption or wastage of power. Inspite of recent improvements, India is lagging intelecommunications, and is virtually the last in penetration of personal computers. Here is anexample of islands of excellence in information technology, but the domestic penetration ofinformation technology is very low.  This position is confirmed by the fact that we are also lowin regard to percentage of technology related exports in manufacturing exports.  While assessingthe future, we should note that, though we have a large pool of scientific personnel andengineers, in terms of their deployment in Research and Development, we are almost at thebottom.  Our rank at 49  in the ‘Growth Competitiveness Index’ among the 59 countriessurveyed in Global Competitiveness Report may be explained significantly by our position inthese infrastructural indicators.Finally, the end product of all economic policy is social well being, and admittedly tlong term prospects for economic growth also depend crucially on the social well being.  Thesocial indicators in regard to our country do not give us too much of comfort.  Literacy levels arelow, though public expenditure as a percentage of GDP is comparable to many other countries.The picture in regard to health and sanitation is not encouraging, and it is unfortunate that we.Overall, we rank rather low in human development and high in human deprivation.Inspite of this, one notices relatively low levels of public expenditures in health, and in primaryeducation though mere expenditures may not reflect actual delivery of services.  I believe thatthere is a very disturbing insensitivity among many of us to human suffering and needs of thepoor, relative to say costs of subsidies and welfare of employees in organised sector.  The policymakers and more importantly opinion makers including academics perhaps need to considerissue of the mending of mindset in favour of the poor.  For now suffice it to say, apart from theissue of social conscience, in assessing long term prospects for growth in cold economic terms,acceptable levels of social development and consequent appropriate role of government appearThe inferences from the above analysis of past performance and current status in theFirst, performance sin ce our plan-era has been mixed in terms of our needs andcapacities, reasonable on a global-scale, and is getting progressively better especially in therecent years.

Obviously, that is not enough to continue with high growth in the medium term.For the medium term, immediate attention to institutional and  issues appear to beThird, the long term prospects are even more contingent on immediate actions in theareas covered by social indicators.  In the context of growing awareness of people and inevitableglobal competition, mere meeting of minimum health needs and imparting literacy wouldcertainly be inadequate.  Healthy population with potential for rapid skill- upgradation isabsolutely essential for us to survive as a nation with dignity and respect.Fourth, both the medium term challenge relating to instit utions and infrastructure as wellas the longer term one relating to social development demand a more focused government and agovernment that efficiently delivers the essential services that it is supposed to deliver, as anoverarching priority.  What we need is not less government and not even more market, but bettergovernment and genuine market.  I humbly submit that it is on this basis that the debate on state market or government  market should now be resolved in our country.  So far,perhaps the reality in our country was often state and market  poor people but effort shouldnow be to aim for State and market  the people, or better government and genuine market Finally, the refocused role of government demands bo th professional skills and personalintegrity among all leading participants.
