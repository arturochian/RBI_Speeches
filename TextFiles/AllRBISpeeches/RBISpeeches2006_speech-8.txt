STATE OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY*Rakesh MohanndIt is my great pleasure to be here at the 2 Annual IndianSecurities Infrastructure & Operations Forum 2006. The recent growthmomentum of the Indian economy is leading to renewed interest in India’sgrowth prospects. As the mid-year review of the annual policy is just over Ithought instead of giving just a run-down of the current state of the Indianeconomy let me put the current trends into a broader perspective - bothwith respect to the longer term trend and as well as the global scenario.Thus, I will proceed as follows:• In order to draw appropriate perspectives for the future of the Indianeconomy, I will first present an overview of India’s economicprogress over the past three decades.• Given the growing integration of the Indian economy with the rest ofthe world, I will then discuss the prospects of the global economy.• This will be followed by an assessment of the current economicsituation in India.• Finally, I will discuss some of the issues necessary to acceleratethe current growth momentum.                                                * nd Inaugural Address of Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, RBI at the 2 Annual IndianSecurities Infrastructure & Operations Forum 2006 at Mumbai on November 7, 2006. The presentthlecture draws on his address at the 4 CII National Council at Kolkata on September 22, 2006.The assistance of Shri Muneesh Kapur in preparing the address is gratefully acknowledged.I. Overview of Longer-Term TrendsGrowth, Savings and InvestmentFollowing the initiation of structural reforms in the early 1990s, theIndian economy has grown at an annual average rate of over 6 per centper annum. While the 1980s had also witnessed high growth (5.8 per centper annum), this growth was associated with widening macroeconomicimbalances – growing fiscal deficits, growing current account deficits,falling international reserves and higher inflation – culminating in thebalance of payments crisis of 1990-91. In contrast, not only has beenthere an acceleration in growth from 5.8 per cent during the 1980s to 6.4per cent between 1992-93 and 2005-06, it has also been achieved in anenvironment of macroeconomic and financial stability, despite largeexogenous shocks, both internal and external, over this period (Table 1).Table 1 : India’s Real GDP GrowthPeriod Average Annual Coefficient ofGrowth (%) Variation1 2 31970s 2.9 1.421980s 5.8 0.391990s 5.8 0.322000-2006 6.4 0.32Memo:1992-93 to 2005-06 6.4 0.24More recently, real GDP growth has averaged more than 8 per centper annum in the three-year period ended 2005-06. Taking into accountthe sharp deceleration in population growth over the past two decades,per capita real GDP growth has recorded a more impressive increase from3.4 per cent per annum during the 1980s to around 6.5 per cent perannum in the recent three years. Developments in the current year so far2suggest that the economy is on course to sustain the recent growthmomentum in 2006-07. The Indian economy is today the world’s second fastest growingeconomy after China. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP,India is the world’s fourth largest economy after the US, China and Japan.India’s share in world GDP (PPP basis) has increased from 4.3 per cent in1991 to almost 6.0 per cent in 2005 (Chart 1).Chart 1 : India's Share in World GDP6.56.05.55.04.54.03.53.0Source: International Monetary Fund.Note: Data for 2006 and 2007 are IMF projections.The step-up in the growth rate of the economy has been facilitatedby increase in domestic investment to over 30 per cent of GDP, financedpredominantly by domestic savings. Domestic savings increased to over29 per cent of GDP by 2004-05 after some stagnation in the second half ofthe 1990s. The improvement in overall savings in recent years hasparticularly benefited from the turnaround in public sector savings. Afterturning negative between 1998-99 and 2002-03 owing to sharpdeterioration in the savings of Government administration, public sectorsavings have turned positive again from 2003-04 onwards, mainlyreflecting the ongoing fiscal consolidation. In 2004-05, the public sectorsavings rate was 2.2 per cent, but it was still less than a half of the peak ofalmost five per cent touched in 1976-77.

Household savings remain the predominantcomponent of domestic savings, contributing almost three-fourths ofoverall domestic savings in 2004-05. For the Indian economy to achievehigher growth on a sustained basis, further improvement in overall savingsis necessary and, in this context, public sector savings will have to play asignificant role (Table 2).Table 2: Domestic Savings in India(Per cent to GDP)Period/Year Household Private Public TotalSector Corporate SectorSector1 2 3 4 51970s 12.2 1.6 3.7 17.51980s 14.6 1.8 3.0 19.41990s 18.5 3.7 1.0 23.22000-2005 22.4 4.2 -0.2 26.3Memo:2004-05 22.0 4.8 2.2 29.1InflationA notable macroeconomic achievement is in regard to inflation,which has seen a significant fall since the mid-1990s to an average ofaround 5 per cent per annum (from around 8 per cent per annum duringthe 1970s and 1980s) (Chart 2). The success with inflation managementreflects largely pre-emptive monetary policy actions, in turn, facilitated byan improved monetary-fiscal interface. The forces of competitionunleashed by growing openness and deregulation of the economy havealso helped to contain the increase in domestic prices. Overall, thesuccess with maintaining price stability has led to low and stable inflationexpectations in the country. As cross-country experience tells us, inflationexpectations play a key role in determining actual inflation movements.The success with maintaining price and financial stability in India has4raised expectations of a structural shift in the medium-term growth path ofthe economy. Although inflation in India has indeed been significantlylower since the mid-1990s compared to the 1970s and 1980s, it needs tobe stressed that inflation in India still remains higher than that of 2-3 percent prevailing in major advanced economies.Chart 2 : WPI Inflation in India302520151050-5It is interesting to note that inflation in the country in the recent pasthas remained relatively benign despite large shocks from record high oiland other commodity prices. The Indian experience in this context isconsistent with the recent experience in other countries; in the currentepisode of the oil shock, globally, inflation, has remained relatively modestcompared to the kind of increase in inflation that took place due to theprevious oil shocks. This is attributable to a number of factors such asdeclining intensity of oil usage, incomplete pass-through in some cases,higher competition and finally stable inflation expectations in view of pre-emptive monetary policy tightening. These issues are explored further inthe next section.Industrial GrowthA welcome feature of the strengthening of economic activity since2003-04 has been the resurgence of manufacturing activity in the country5Per cent1970-711972-731974-751976-771978-791980-811982-831984-851986-871988-891990-911992-931994-951996-971998-992000-012002-032004-05(Charts 3 and 4). After recording high growth in the mid-1990s, themanufacturing sector exhibited stagnation till 2001-02. Since then,manufacturing has registered a gradual pick-up and this growth has beensustained in the current year so far. Notwithstanding the rebound inmanufacturing activity, employment growth in manufacturing activityremains low (Table 3).Chart 3 : Industrial Production in India1614121086420Manufacturing (IIP) General (IIP)Chart 4 : Growth in Industry: 2002-20051210864206Growth Rate (Per cent)Per cent1994-95China1995-96Thailand1996-97India1997-981998-99SouthKorea1999-00China-Taipei2000-01Singapore2001-022002-03Malaysia2003-04Philippines2004-052005-06IndonesiaTable 3: Employment in Industry(Per cent of total employment)Country/Year 1980 20001 2 3India 13.9 18.2Brazil 24.7 19.3China 18.2 23.0Indonesia 13.2 17.3South Korea 29.0 28.0Malaysia 24.1 32.2Mexico 26.5 26.9Thailand 10.3 19.0Turkey 34.9 24.5Source: Kalpana Kochhar, Utsav Kumar, Raghuram Rajan, ArvindSubramanian and Ioannis Tokatlidis (2006), "India's Pattern ofDevelopment: What Happened, What Follows?", Journal of MonetaryEconomics, Vol. 53.Growth in Bank CreditThe upturn in economic activity is mirrored in the sustained growthin demand for bank credit. Bank credit has increased sharply from 30 percent of GDP at end-March 2000 to 48 per cent by end-March 2006 (Chart5). Non-food credit extended by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs)recorded an average annual growth of 26.1 per cent between 2002-03 and2005-06, notably higher than that of 14.5 per cent recorded during thepreceding four-year period (1998-99 to 2001-02) as well as the long-runaverage of 17.8 per cent (1970-2006). The stagnation in credit flowobserved during the late 1990s, in retrospect, was partly caused byreduction in demand on account of increase in real interest rates, turndown in the business cycle, and the significant business restructuring thatoccurred during that period. Apart from the revival of economic activity, thesharp growth in bank credit in the recent years can be attributed to factorssuch as financial deepening from a low base, structural shifts in supplyelasticities, rising efficiency of credit markets and policy initiatives toimprove flow of credit to sectors like the agriculture and small scale units.Increasingly, retail credit led by demand for housing as well as other retail7loans is emerging as a major driver of growth in bank credit. This isreflected in the sharp increase in the share of housing credit in overallcredit extended by SCBs from 2.4 per cent at end-March 1990 to 11.0 percent at end-March 2005. Growth in retail credit has also emanated fromincreased use of credit cards, loans for consumer durables and demandfor education loans. The share of non-housing retail credit in total bankcredit has increased from four per cent at end-March 1990 to around 11per cent at end-March 2005.  Thus, the share of total retail credit in bankcredit has increased from 6.4 per cent to over 22 per cent in the past 15years (Chart 6). As a result of these trends, the share of industry in totalcredit has been falling since the late 1990s (Chart 7).Chart 5 : Credit to GDP Ratio45.040.035.030.025.020.015.010.05.00.08Per cent1970-711972-731974-751976-771978-791980-811982-831984-851986-871988-891990-911992-931994-951996-971998-992000-012002-032004-05Chart 6 : Retail Credit121086420Housing Personal loans (other than housing)Chart 7 : Credit to Agriculture and Industry6050403020100Agriculture IndustryExternal SectorThe external sector has witnessed dramatic transformation over thepast 15 years. There is growing integration of the Indian economy with therest of the world. In contrast to the constant stress experienced withrespect to the external sector during the period till the early 1990s, thebalance of payments position since then has remained comfortable. Asummary indicator of the strength of the external sector is provided byIndia’s foreign currency assets which are now close to US $ 160 billion (ason October 27, 2006) in contrast to a mere US $ 1 billion in June 1991.This significant improvement can be attributed to the combination of9Per cent to total bank credit Per cent to total bank creditJune-80June-80June-87June-87June-89June-89March-91March-91March-93March-93March-95 March-95March-97 March-97March-99 March-99March-01 March-01March-03 March-03March-05March-05policies related to the external sector such as reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers, current account convertibility, prudential approach to capitalaccount liberalisation, preference for foreign investment flows, especiallydirect investment flows, constraints imposed on debt flows and a market-determined exchange rate system. These policies have enhanced accessto external markets while promoting productivity gains and ensuringfinancial stability. This is mirrored in strong growth in merchandise exportsand, more strikingly, growth in exports of services and remittances. As aresult, the country has been able to finance its increasing import demandwhile keeping current account deficits quite modest – an average of only0.5 per cent of GDP since 1991-92 as against a deficit of 1.8 per cent ofGDP during the 1980s (Charts 8 and 9).Chart 8: Import Cover of Reserves181614121086420Merchandise Import Cover of ReservesCurrent Payments Cover of Reserves10Number of months1970-711972-731974-751976-771978-791980-811982-831984-851986-871988-891990-911992-931994-951996-971998-992000-012002-032004-05 Chart 9: Current Account Deficit4.03.02.01.00.0-1.0-2.0-3.0Note: Minus indicates surplus.The growth in services receipts has been led by the significantexpansion in software exports, and other professional and businessservices. Reflecting the sustained growth since the early 1990s, grossinvisible receipts (i.e., services, transfers and income taken together) haveexpanded sharply from 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 11.5 per cent in2005-06, outpacing the growth in merchandise exports (which increasedfrom 5.8 per cent of GDP to 13.1 per cent over the same period). This hasled to a rise in the share of invisibles in the current receipts (exports andinvisibles combined) from 29 per cent in 1990-91 to 47 per cent in 2005-06(Table 4). As a result, the ratio of current receipts to GDP has nearlytrebled from 8.2 per cent in 1990-91 to 24.5 per cent in 2005-06.Reflecting the continued buoyancy of India’s services exports, the share ofIndia’s services exports in world exports has trebled in the course of just adecade - from 0.6 per cent in 1995 to 1.8 per cent in 2004 (Chart 10).thIndia was the 18 largest service exporter in the world in 2004. The gainsrecorded by the exports of services have far exceeded those recorded byexports of goods.11Per cent to GDP1970-711972-731974-751976-771978-791980-811982-831984-851986-871988-891990-911992-931994-951996-971998-992000-012002-032004-05Table 4: India’s Invisible Receipts(US $ billion)Year Services Transfers Income InvisiblesReceipts/ CurrentReceipts(per cent)1 2 3 4 51990-91 4.6 2.5 0.4 291995-96 7.3 8.9 1.4 352000-01 16.3 13.3 2.7 422001-02 17.1 16.2 3.4 452002-03 20.8 17.6 3.5 442003-04 26.9 22.7 3.9 452004-05 46.0 21.3 4.5 472005-06 60.6 25.2 5.7 47Chart 10 : India's Exports of Services and Goods2.01.51.00.5India's Exports of Goods (as per cent of World Exports of Goods)India's Exports of Services (as per cent of World Exports of Services)Foreign investment has increased from negligible levels till the early1990s to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2005-06 (Chart 11). Both direct andportfolio investment flows have recorded significant increases, althoughthe inflows under direct investment remain relatively low compared toother recipient countries. The volume of FDI inflows into India is, however,growing on the back of growing interest by many of the world’s leadingmultinationals. India has improved its rank from fifteenth (in 2002) to12Per cent1995199619971998199920002001200220032004become the second most likely FDI destination after China in 2005. Netcapital flows received by India amounted to US $ 25 billion in 2005-06;gross capital inflows and outflows were much higher at US $ 139 billionand US $ 115 billion, respectively, pointing towards growing openness andintegration of the Indian economy with the global economy. Consequently,global economic developments are likely to have more pronounced effectson the Indian economy than hitherto. Policies that take advantage of thegrowing openness while minimising the adverse consequences have beenfollowed since early 1990s and these have served the country well so far.Indeed, not only is India a recipient of FDI inflows, but Indian companiesare also increasingly investing abroad to take advantage of opportunitiesavailable in the global market. Outward FDI investment was as high as US$ 2.7 billion in 2005-06 and cumulative FDI investment abroad isestimated at US $ 12 billion at end-March 2006.Chart 11 : Foreign Investment in India14121086420-2Direct Investment Portfolio InvestmentPublic FinancePublic finances have exhibited a mixed trend in the reforms period.After witnessing some correction till 1996-97, public finances witnessed a13US $ billion1990-911991-921992-931993-941994-951995-961996-971997-981998-991999-20002000-012001-022002-032003-042004-052005-06deterioration, reflecting a variety of factors such as the decline in taxrevenues (as per cent to GDP) in consonance with the cyclical downturnthof economic activity, as well as the effects of the 5 Pay Commissionaward. Indeed, the combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and States washigher in 2001-02 than that in 1990-91 (Chart 12). Since 2002-03onwards, public finances have witnessed a significant improvement,reflecting both policy efforts at fiscal consolidation as well as the upturn ineconomic activity. Notwithstanding this recent correction, combined publicdebt remains high (almost 79 per cent of GDP). Furthermore, capitalexpenditure remains low (Table 5) and the tax-GDP ratio, despite recentimprovement, also remains low (Table 6 and Chart 13).Chart 12 : Combined Fiscal Deficit10.09.08.07.06.05.0Table 5: Central Government’s Expenditure(Per cent to GDP)RevenueYear Expenditure Capital Outlay1 2 31970-71 6.9 2.11980-81 10.0 2.11990-91 12.9 2.11995-96 11.8 1.22000-01 13.2 1.22005-06 RE 12.5 1.62006-07 BE 12.4 1.714Per cent to GDP1980-811982-831984-851986-871988-891990-911992-931994-951996-971998-992000-012002-032004-05Table 6: Gross Tax Revenues of the Centre(Per cent to GDP)Year Direct Tax Indirect Tax Total1 2 3 41990-91 1.9 8.2 10.11991-92 2.3 8 10.31992-93 2.4 7.5 101993-94 2.4 6.5 8.81994-95 2.7 6.5 9.11995-96 2.8 6.5 9.41996-97 2.8 6.6 9.41997-98 3.2 6.0 9.11998-99 2.7 5.6 8.31999-2000 3.0 5.8 8.82000-01 3.2 5.7 8.92001-02 3.0 5.2 8.22002-03 3.4 5.4 8.82003-04 3.8 5.4 9.22004-05 4.2 5.5 9.82005-06 (RE) 4.8 5.7 10.52006-07 (BE) 5.3 5.9 11.2RE : Revised Estimates.

It is noteworthy that despite a series of exogenous shockssuch as the Asian crisis, sanctions due to nuclear explosions, the sharprise in oil prices to record highs, large corrections in stock markets,financial stability has been maintained. The asset quality of the bankingsector has recorded a significant improvement: the ratio of net non-performing assets to net advances has declined from 8.1 per cent at end-March 1997 to 2.0 per cent at end-March 2006 despite tightening ofprudential norms. There is growing competition in the banking sector, asindicated by the rising share of private sector banks in total bankingassets. The overall capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector as awhole has increased from 10.4 per at end-March 1997 to 12.8 per cent atend-March 2006. Operating expenses of scheduled commercial bankshave declined from 2.1 per cent of total assets in 1992 to 1.8 per cent in2004 indicative of improvements in efficiency.

World Economic SituationAs noted earlier, the openness of the Indian economy has nearlytrebled between 1990-91 and 2005-06. The Indian economy is thus nowmuch more intertwined with the global economy. In order to assess theprospects for the domestic economy, it would, therefore, be relevant toreview the prospects of the global economy.According to the latest assessment of the IMF in its WorldEconomic Outlook (September 2006), the global economy (usingexchange rates based on purchasing power parities) is expected to recordan accelerated growth of 5.1 per cent in 2006, higher than that of 4.9 percent in 2005. This is the fourth successive year of strong, above trend,growth despite continuous headwinds form record high oil prices andelevated non-commodity prices. Global growth is expected to average 4.9per cent per annum between 2003 and 2006, significantly higher thangrowth of 3.9 per cent registered between 1996 and 2000 and 2.8 per centbetween 1991 and 1995. Headwinds from higher commodity prices havebeen offset by productivity gains across the world, in both developed andemerging economies, emanating from forces of globalisation, the ICTrevolution, creation of global supply chains, greater efficiency in financial18per centmarkets and better macroeconomic policies. Global growth has been ledby the US and emerging economies led by China and India. A positivefeature is that global economic activity is now becoming more balanced,with the euro area gaining momentum, along with sustained expansion inJapan. Economic activity in the US, on the other hand, is slowing downmainly on the back of a cooling housing market. Global economic growthis expected to maintain its recent above-trend growth in 2007; the IMFprojects growth to be 4.9 per cent in 2007 (in PPP terms) (Charts 18 and19). Concomitantly, growth in world trade has remained buoyant. Worldtrade in goods and services in volume terms has increased by an averageof 9 per cent per annum during 2004 and 2005 and is expected to grow byanother 9 per cent in 2006.Chart 18 : Global Real GDP Growth : Annual654321019Per cent199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007Chart 19: Global Real GDP Growth - Quarterly12.010.08.06.04.02.00.0U.S.A. Euro Area OECD Countries ChinaWhile global growth has remained strong, it faces a number ofdownside risks. One such risk emanates from high oil prices andcommodity inflation. Globally, inflation has edged up reflecting higher oiland other commodity prices, but surprisingly, the impact has remainedrelatively muted compared to previous oil shocks.  It is also worthstressing that since 2003 onwards, real interest rates are at very lowlevels in many countries and monetary and credit aggregates have beenrecording above trend growth. Yet, consumer price inflation has beenrelatively benign, even in the face of sharply higher oil and othercommodity prices (Charts 20 and 21). This phenomenon has been aptlydescribed as the “Great Liquidity Expansion Puzzle”.202004Q12004Q22004Q32004Q42005Q12005Q22005Q32005Q42006Q12006Q22006Q3Year-on-year (per cent)Chart 20: International Commodity Prices 22020018016014012010080 Non-Fuel Commodities Food Metals Crude Oil Source: International Monetary Fund.

Lower trade barriers, increased deregulation,innovation and competition and efficiency gains arising from global supplychains all over the world helped in containing inflationary pressures. Withthe rapid expansion in tradables, domestic economies are, therefore,increasingly exposed to the rigours of international competition andcomparative advantage, reducing unwarranted price mark-ups.21March 2004 =100Per centMar-04Mar-04May-04Jun-04Jul-04Sep-04Sep-04Nov-04Dec-04Jan-05Mar-05Mar-05May-05Jun-05Jul-05Sep-05Sep-05Nov-05Dec-05Jan-06Mar-06Mar-06May-06Jul-06 Jun-06Sep-06Sep-06Productivity growth in a number of sectors, partly due to IT investmentscombined with restructuring, has also enabled absorption of higher costs.Fall in intensity of oil usage, and, in case of many emerging marketeconomies, less-than-complete pass-through of oil prices have alsohelped to contain headline inflation. Finally, changes in the conduct ofmonetary policy frameworks such as inflation targeting regimes withgreater focus on price stability and increased central bank credibility havecontributed to keeping inflationary expectations largely stable andanchored at low levels.Nonetheless, the cumulative impact of the past increases in oil andother commodity prices has led to headline inflation in many economiesmarginally exceeding their respective targets. Central banks have,therefore, been tightening their monetary policies to stabilise inflationexpectations, especially since demand conditions have been strong andoutput gaps are closing in most of the economies (Chart 22). While theFederal Reserve in the US has paused since end-June 2006 after 17successive hikes of 25 basis points each between June 2004 and June2006, it has indicated that further tightening would depend upon theincoming information. The European Central Bank is anticipated tocontinue to tighten further, despite a pause in its latest meeting. Thus,global interest rates, which had eased significantly during 2002-2003, arelikely to remain relatively higher in the short-term. Although in recentweeks, international crude oil prices have eased substantially to below US$ 60 a barrel, they still remain quite high and furthermore, the outlookremains uncertain. Moreover, although headline inflation in majoradvanced economies has indeed exhibited significant moderation duringSeptember 2006, core inflation continues to remain firm.22Chart 22 : Central Bank Policy Rates76543210US (Fed Funds Rate)UK (Official Bank Rate)Euro Area (Interest Rate on Main Refinancing Operations)India (Reverse Repo Rate)In brief, globally, both output growth and consumer price inflationare relatively more stable despite a series of supply shocks. On the otherhand, commodity prices, exchange rates and other asset prices haveexhibited heightened volatility. When inflation and interest rates are low,as is the case now, small changes in inflation expectations or interest rateexpectations can lead to repricing of risks which can be quite large. Inturn, this repricing of risks can lead to elevated volatility in asset prices, aswas witnessed during May-June 2006.III. Current Economic Situation: IndiaAgainst this backdrop of external outlook, it would be useful to havean assessment of the Indian economy for 2006-07, based ondevelopments during 2006-07 so far. A review of the developmentssuggests that the Indian economy is on its way of achieving growth closeto that witnessed during the past three years (Table 7).23Per centJan-04Apr-04Jul-04Oct-04Jan-05Apr-05Jul-05Oct-05Jan-06Apr-06Jul-06Oct-06Table 7 : India’s Real GDP Growth(Per cent)Sector Full Year April-June  (Base: 1999-2000)   2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2005 2006(QE) (RE)1 2 3 4 5 6 71 Agriculture and Allied 10.0 0.7 3.9 3.4 3.4Activities2 Industry 6.6 7.4 7.6 9.5 9.72.1 Mining and Quarrying 5.3 5.8 0.9 3.1 3.42.2 Manufacturing 7.1 8.1 9.0 10.7 11.32.3 Electricity, Gas and 4.8 4.3 5.3 7.4 5.4Water Supply3 Services 8.5 10.2 10.3 10.1 10.53.1 Construction 10.9 12.5 12.1 12.4 9.53.2 Trade, Hotels and 12.0 10.6 11.5 11.7 13.2Restaurants, Transport,Storage andCommunication3.3 Financing, Insurance, 4.5 9.2 9.7 8.8 8.9Real Estate andBusiness Services3.4 Community, Social and 5.4 9.2 7.8 7.3 9.5Personal Services4 Gross Domestic 8.5 7.5 8.4 8.5 8.9ProductAgricultureAssuming trend growth in agriculture under normal monsoonconditions and barring domestic or external shocks, the Reserve Bank inits Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07 (April 2006) placed real GDPgrowth, for policy purposes, in the range of 7.5-8.0 per cent during 2006-07. The Reserve Bank reaffirmed its forecast for GDP growth in July 2006in its First Quarter Review of the Annual Statement on Monetary Policy.The Reserve Bank revised upwards its forecast for GDP growth to around8.0 per cent in October 2006 in its Mid-Term Review on the back ofimprovement in industrial outlook and expected sustenance of growth24momentum in services. Other agencies have also placed their growthestimates close to 8 per cent.Industry and Infrastructure Led by manufacturing, the upturn in the industrial sector is enteringits fifth year of expansion in 2006-07. Manufacturing activity has remainedstronger than expected in the current fiscal year so far. Based onmovements in the index of industrial production (IIP), growth inmanufacturing activity accelerated to 11.8 per cent during April-August2006 from 9.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2005. In terms ofuse-based classification, all sectors, excepting consumer non-durableshave exhibited acceleration. Notably, growth in capital goods productionaccelerated to nearly 19 per cent, even on a high base, reflective of stronginvestment activity in the economy (Table 8).Table 8: Index of Industrial ProductionSector Weights Growth Rate (Per cent)in IIP        April-March April-August 2004-05 2005-06 2005 20061 2 3 4 5 6IIP 100.0 8.4 8.1 8.7 10.6Basic Goods 35.6 5.5 6.6 6.9 8.3Capital Goods 9.3 13.9 15.8 13.8 18.6Intermediate Goods 26.5 6.1 2.4 3.5 9.5Consumer Goods 28.7 11.7 12.0 13.7 11.3i) Consumer Durables 5.4 14.4 14.9 13.0 16.6ii) Consumer Non-Durables 23.3 10.8 11.1 13.9 9.5On the other hand, the six infrastructure industries have recordedonly modest improvement to 7.3 per cent during April-September 2006from 6.1 per cent in the corresponding period of 2005. This improvementwas helped by a turnaround in the production of crude oil and petroleum25refinery products – these two sectors had registered negative growth ayear ago. Electricity generation, coal, and oil production, however,remained subdued (Table 9).Table 9 : Infrastructure ActivityWeight in IIP Growth in per cent (y-o-y)(per cent)April- April-March SeptemberSector 2004-05 2005-06 2005 20061 2 3 4 5 6Electricity 10.2 5.2 4.9 4.7 6.7Coal 3.2 6.2 7.0 6.0 5.3Finished Steel 5.1 8.4 8.0 13.7 7.2Cement 2.0 6.6 12.3 11.4 10.0Crude Petroleum 4.2 1.8 -5.3 -5.0 4.1Petroleum RefineryProducts 2.0 4.3 2.1 -0.7 12.3Composite InfrastructureIndex 26.7 5.8 5.3 6.1 7.3The resilience shown by the industrial sector against the hardeningof global oil prices is reflective of inherent strengths and capabilities thatthe industrial sector has built up over the years since the initiation ofeconomic reforms in the country. There is evidence of growingcompetitiveness in respect of sectors such as automobiles andpharmaceuticals, with potential to emerge as a manufacturing base forglobal production. At the same time, in the face of challenges frominfrastructural bottlenecks, elevated input costs from higher oil and othercommodity prices, likely imports from China and the possibility ofemerging shortages of domestic skilled labour, the domesticmanufacturing sector will have to continuously improve its productivity andcompetitiveness in order to sustain the current growth momentum.26Corporate ProfitabilityIn recent years, a striking feature of the Indian corporate sector isits growing engagement with the global economy. Apart from merchandisetrade in goods and services, this growing integration has taken the form oflarge scale cross-border merger and acquisition activities. Thus, not onlyIndia is a recipient of foreign direct investment, but the corporate sector isalso exploring opportunities to invest abroad. Following the phasedliberalisation in the regime for Indian investments overseas, investments injoint ventures (JV) and wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) abroad haveemerged as important avenues for promoting global business by Indiancompanies. Indian firms are acquiring firms abroad to leveragecomparative advantage of foreign locations, to acquire appropriatetechnologies and to have a marketing and distribution base with theultimate objective of attaining economies of scale and productivity gains.As noted earlier, India’s direct investment overseas amounted to US $ 2.7billion during the year (Chart 23). The value of acquisitions is, however,much higher since these data only capture the cross-border remittance ofoutward FDI from India. The number of Indian companies listed on stockexchanges abroad has seen a consistent increase. The growingintegration of the Indian corporate sector is also visible from the trends intheir exports and imports. The ratio of merchandise exports to salestrebled from 6.2 per cent in 1990-91 to 18.6 per cent by 2004-05 while theratio of imports to sales has increased from 7.9 per cent to 21.6 per centover the same period (Chart 24).  27Chart 23 : India's Direct Investment Abroad3.02.52.01.51.00.50.02000-01 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06Manufacturing Financial Services Services Trading OthersChart 24 : Corporate Sector: External Trade2520151050Exports to Sales (%) Imports to Sales %Corporate profitability has recorded strong growth for over threeyears now. Profits after tax of a sample non-financial non-Governmentcompanies recorded a growth of more than 40 per cent for 11 successivequarters from October-December 2002 to April-June 2005. Subsequently,growth in profitability decelerated over the next three quarters of 2005-06on the back of rising input costs as well as higher debt servicing costs.Available information for 2006-07 suggests a reversal of the decelerationtrend; growth in profits after tax accelerated to 35 per cent during April-28US $ billion1990-911991-921992-931993-941994-951995-961996-971997-981998-991999-002000-012001-022002-032003-042004-05June 2006 from around 15 per cent in the preceding quarter (Table 10). Itis interesting that corporate profitability has remained strong, despitesharp rise in input costs. Perhaps, the strong profitability can be partlyattributed to productivity gains. Looking ahead, a critical question is: howlong can corporate profitability and productivity continue to exhibitbuoyancy?Table 10: Corporate Sector Performance(Growth rates, per cent)Item 2003- 2004- 2005- 2005-06 2006- 04 05 06 07   Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q11 2 3 4 9 10 11 12 13Sales 16 24.1 16.9 18.5 16.4 13.2 19.5 25.6Expenditure 13.2 21.9 16.4 18 16.3 12.7 18.9 24.6Gross Profit 25 32.5 20.3 32 19.1 21.2 16.6 33.9Interest Cost -11.9 -5.8 1.9 -13.5 -8 4.6 3.8 19.9Profit After Tax 59.8 51.2 24.2 54.2 27.5 27 15.1 34.7Note :  1.

Recovery in domestic stock markets, buoyant corporateperformance and business confidence all suggest that investment climateremains upbeat and this should support economic activity. There has beena large increase in investment intentions: the value of investmentintentions registered in Industrial Entrepreneurs Memoranda have morethan doubled from Rs.1,54,954 crore in 2003-04 to Rs. 3,82,743 crore in2005-06. However, it remains to be seen as to how much of theseinvestments fructify? Issues of financing of investments will also assumeimportance in this context as these investment intentions move towardsfructification.29Banking DevelopmentsBank deposits as well as credit have recorded strong growth duringthe fiscal year 2006-07 indicative of strong demand conditions. Bank credithas continued to record year-on-year growth of over 30 per cent for morethan a year. Bank credit has been largely broad-based, although some ofthe sectors such as housing and other retail and commercial real estatehave expanded more rapidly. In this context, it would be relevant to notethat the credit-GDP ratio in India - notwithstanding the sharp rise since2000 - remains lower than in many Asian economies as well as inadvanced economies. Deposit growth has accelerated, which could beattributed partly to higher interest rates on time deposits as well asextension of tax benefits for deposits above 5-year maturity.Concomitantly, growth in broad money (M3), y-o-y, at 19.0 per cent as onOctober 13, 2006 remains above the indicative trajectory of 15.0 per centprojected in the Annual Policy Statement (Table 11).  By currentindications, as the Reserve Bank noted in its Mid-Term Review(October 2006), the growth in monetary and credit aggregates is nowexpected to be somewhat higher than the initial indicativeprojections. In view of sustained demand for credit from the commercialsector, banks’ continue to restrict their incremental investments inGovernment securities. As a result, the banks’ holdings of SLR securitieshave declined to around 30 per cent as on October 13, 2006 from around35 per cent a year ago. As the ratio approaches the statutory minimum of25 per cent, the flexibility available to the banks by switching their assetportfolio in favour of credit to the commercial sector by restricting theirincremental investments in SLR securities is, thus, getting progressivelylimited. In the context of sustained high growth in bank credit, the ReserveBank has raised risk weights and provisioning requirements for sectorswitnessing large credit growth. In view of the high credit growth, theReserve Bank has also been drawing the attention of banks to the need toensure asset quality in order to maintain financial stability.30Table 11 : Money and Credit(Per cent)Item Year on-Year GrowthOctober 14, 2005 October 13, 20061 2 3Broad Money 16.8 19.0Of which:Currency with Public 14.6 17.3Commercial Bank Deposits 18.6 20.7Commercial Bank Non-food Credit 31.8 30.5Commercial Bank Investment in Gilts 5.9 2.5Demand for bank credit is likely to remain strong in view of vastdemands for financing the infrastructure investment, the growing size ofthe services sector, SMEs and rural enterprises. The emphasis onfinancial inclusion will also lead to enhanced need for financialintermediation. The corporate sector, in the coming years, is, therefore,likely to face greater competition for bank credit as the banks exploreemerging avenues such as retail credit. The banking system has torespond adequately to these new challenges, opportunities and risks.Innovative channels for credit delivery for serving these new rural creditneeds, encompassing full supply chain financing, covering storage,warehousing, processing, and transportation from farm to market will haveto be found. In view of the expected large demand for bank credit, bankswill have to simultaneously put in steps to increase deposit mobilisation.Concomitantly, it is important to keep monetary growth consistent with therequirements of price stability.InflationHeadline inflation during 2006-07 so far (5.4 per cent as on October21, 2006) remains relatively contained, even as supply shocks from higherprimary food articles prices have got accentuated. Primary articlesinflation, year-on-year, has increased to 7.8 per cent on the back of higherprices of wheat, pulses and milk. As regards fuel prices, its impact ondomestic inflation has petered out in recent weeks on the back of base31effects. In this context, the recent decline in international crude oil prices, ifsustained, is welcome. However, it needs to be noted that the pass-through of higher international crude oil prices to domestic prices remainsincomplete as LPG and kerosene prices have remained unchanged sinceNovember 2004 and April 2002, respectively. Manufactured productsinflation has also edged higher in recent months, although it remainsrelatively modest (Charts 25 and 26).Chart : 25 Wholesale Price Inflation 987654321Year-on-year Average Year-on-year excluding fuelChart 26 : Major Groups' Inflation161310741-2Primary Articles Fuel Group Manufactured Products32Per centPer cent3-Apr-043-Apr-0412-Jun-0412-Jun-0421-Aug-0421-Aug-0430-Oct-0430-Oct-048-Jan-058-Jan-0519-Mar-05 19-Mar-0528-May-05 28-May-056-Aug-056-Aug-0515-Oct-0515-Oct-0524-Dec-0524-Dec-054-Mar-064-Mar-0613-May-0613-May-0622-Jul-0622-Jul-0630-Sep-0630-Sep-06Various measures of consumer price inflation – which has a greaterweight on prices of food articles – remain higher than that of wholesaleprice inflation. In order to contain inflationary expectations, the ReserveBank increased the reverse repo rate as well as the repo rate by 25 basispoints each in June 2006 and July 2006. The Reserve Bank increased therepo rate by another 25 basis points to 7.25 per cent in its Mid-termReview (October 2006) while leaving the reverse repo rate unchanged at6.00 per cent – there has, thus, been a cumulative increase of 150 basispoints in the reverse repo rate and 125 basis points in the repo rate sincethe tightening began in October 2004. The monetary measures have beensupported by fiscal measures such as exempting imports of wheat, pulsesand sugar from customs duty, reduction in customs duty on palm oils andrestriction on exports of pulses. Pressures on primary articles prices, lowstocks in case of wheat as well as shortfall in global production posecontinuing challenges for monetary management. Furthermore, as theMid-Term Review of the Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07 hasobserved, recent developments, in particular, the combination of highgrowth and consumer inflation coupled with escalating asset prices andtightening infrastructural bottlenecks underscore the need to reckon withdangers of potential overheating and the implications for the timing anddirection of monetary policy setting. While there is no conclusive evidenceof potential overheating in the Indian economy at the current juncture, thecriticality of monitoring all available indications that point to excessaggregate demand is perhaps more relevant now than ever before.The cumulative rainfall during the South-West monsoon season(June-September 2006) was close to normal; the inter-temporal as well asinter-spatial distribution, however, turned out to be uneven. As a result,kharif foodgrains output for 2006 is now anticipated to be almost four percent below that achieved in 2005. Looking ahead, the total live waterstorage in the 76 major reservoirs as on October 12, 2006 at 90 per centof the Full Reservoir Level remains higher than that of 81 per cent a year33ago and portends well for the ensuing rabi crops. However, in a medium-term perspective, the stagnation in domestic foodgrains production in therecent years has emerged as a clear cause of concern, impinging bothupon domestic demand as well as domestic prices. These issues areaddressed in detail in the subsequent section.External SectorFinally, external sector developments indicate continued buoyancyin both merchandise and service exports, suggestive of growingcompetitiveness of Indian manufacturing and services. Oil imports haveposted large growth so far, reflecting the further hardening of internationalcrude oil prices until mid-August 2006. The recent easing of internationalcrude oil prices, if sustained, could restrict the growth of oil imports goingforward. Non-oil imports, on the other hand, have recorded a sharpdeceleration, which could be partly attributed to imports of gold and silver(which declined by 30 per cent during April-June 2006 as against anincrease of 52 per cent during April-June 2005). Imports of capital goodscontinued to record strong growth (38 per cent during April-June 2006).Capital flows have remained strong led by higher inflows under FDI, NRIdeposits and issuances under ADRs/GDRs even as there were outflowsby foreign institutional investors (FIIs). On the whole, India’s foreignexchange reserves have increased by US $ 14.5 billion in the currentfiscal year so far to US $ 166.2 billion as on October 20, 2006. Looking ahead, despite the growing oil import bill, the anticipatedcurrent account deficit in 2006-07 is manageable, as in the past, due tothe continuing underlying strength of merchandise exports, invisibles andcapital flows. The balance of payments is, therefore, expected to remaincomfortable during 2006-07.In brief, an assessment of the developments during 2006-07 so farsuggests reinforcement of the robust economic growth exhibited in recent34years. For the current growth momentum to be maintained and to beimproved upon, a number of issues such as agriculture, infrastructure, andfiscal consolidation need to be addressed. These are discussed next.IV. IssuesInstead of summarising my remarks, let me flag some issues thatare going to be rather important in the days to come.AgricultureThe agriculture sector in the recent years has been marked by lowand volatile growth – real GDP growth in the agricultural sector during thefirst four years of the Tenth Five Year Plan has averaged only two per centper annum as against four per cent envisaged in the Plan period (2002-07). A key factor underlying this low and volatile growth is the stagnationin domestic production in the case of major crops like wheat, sugar andpulses. Illustratively, the production of wheat after touching a peak of 76million tonnes (mt) in 1999-2000 has since then been range-bound ataround 70 mt. Similarly, the production of pulses has not been able toexceed the peak of 14.9 mt reached in 1998-99. The production of pulsesat 13.1 mt in 2005-06 was even lower than the levels achieved more than15 years back (14.3 mt in 1990-91). The stagnation in production, in turn,can be partly attributed to stagnancy in investment in the agriculturalsector which, at constant (1999-2000) prices, at Rs.43,123 crore in 2004-05 was even lower than that of Rs.43,473 crore in 1999-2000. As a result,the ratio of investment to GDP fell from 2.2 per cent in 1999-2000 to 1.7per cent in 2004-05 (Chart 27).35Chart 27 : Investment in Agriculture60,000 2.550,0002.240,0001.930,0001.620,0001.310,0000 1.01999-00 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05Public Private Total (% to GDP) (right scale)For the Indian economy to attain growth rates of 8 per cent andabove, the stagnation in production of major crops and agriculturalinvestment needs to be reversed. First, investment outlays on irrigationfacilities need to be stepped up along with focus on efficient use of waterresources. In this context, appropriate pricing of power can be helpful inavoiding the excessive use of ground water. Second, given the severalrisks that farmers face such as future price and monsoon conditions, thereis a need to put in place proper risk mitigation policies. Third, greater focuson rural infrastructure is required to enhance the productivity of physicalresources, and improve supply chain management and value addition inagriculture. Improvements in rural infrastructure will facilitate foodprocessing and other agro-based industries. In this context, the focus onrural infrastructure development under Bharat Nirman is welcome. Fourth,globalisation, rising income, and urbanisation call for increasingdiversification and value addition in Indian agriculture. The shifts inconsumption pattern warrant a shift of land and other resources to cropswith higher potential for value addition. Fifth, effective linkagesof production systems with marketing, agro-processing and other valueadded activities would play an increasingly important role in diversificationof agriculture. Sixth, more focus needs to be placed on agricultural36Rupees crore (1999-2000 prices)Per cent to GDPresearch in the coming years as the success so far has been restricted toselect crops. Finally, the Reserve Bank is intensifying its efforts inrevitalising the rural cooperative credit system, strengthening regionalrural banks, providing incentives to commercial banks for investments inrural economy and ensuring an adequate and timely delivery of credit atan appropriate price. Higher growth and stability in the agricultural sectorwill also provide a strong demand impetus for the non-agricultural sector(RBI, Annual Report, 2005-06).  InfrastructureThe sustenance and strengthening of the ongoing manufacturingresurgence will depend critically upon improvements in infrastructurefacilities in a number of areas. Improvements that have taken place ininfrastructure facilities in areas such as telecommunications, civil aviation,roads and, to some extent, ports and railways would need to be extendedto the power sector. Electricity generation continues to be hampered bypolicy shortcomings, continued excessive transmission and distributionlosses, and collection of dues along with emerging difficulties in theavailability of coal and gas. Unreliable supply of power and that too athigher tariffs vis-à-vis other countries such as China can have adverseimplications for competitiveness of the domestic manufacturing sector.Provision of urban infrastructure facilities also needs greaterattention. Globally, cities have consistently provided the environment forinstitutional and technological innovation, and acted as engines ofeconomic growth. In this context, it may be noted that, in the last century,India did not face an “urban explosion” as against rapid urbanizationacross the globe. India’s level of urbanisation increased from 17.6 per centin 1951 to only 23.7 per cent in 1981 and 27.8 per cent in 2001.Consistent with its low per capita income India ranks among the last thirtyin the list of countries listed according to their urbanisation levels. Despite37its low level of urbanisation, India’s urban population has grown to morethan 285 million in 2001, close to 28 per cent of the total population of thecountry.  In the last decade the overall increase in population has beenparticularly large at about 70 million people, which is larger than the urbanpopulation of all countries except Brazil, China, Indonesia, Russia, and theUnited States. Therefore, even though India’s level of urbanisationcontinues to be low and its urban population growth rate is not among thefastest in the world, the magnitude of urbanisation in India per se is large.Moreover, most of the growth in urban population has been due to theenlargement of existing towns at every level and not significantly due tothe addition of new towns. This stable, rather static, situation has resultedin a stable city primacy hierarchy, but is also accompanied with vast areasof the country still continuing to be devoid of urban settlements of any sizeleading to extremely low levels of urbanisation of 10-15 percent in theseregions (Table 12).Table 12: Trends in Urbanisation(Population in millions)Year Number of Total Rural Urban Urban/UAs/Towns Population Population Population Total (%)1 2 3 4 5 61901 1,830 238 213 26 10.81911 1,815 252 226 26 10.31921 1,944 251 223 28 11.21931 2,066 279 246 34 12.01941 2,253 319 275 44 13.01951 2,822 361 299 62 17.31961 2,334 439 360 79 18.01971 2,567 548 439 109 19.91981 3,347 683 524 160 23.31991 3,769 846 629 218 25.72001 4,378 1,027 742 285 27.8Studies show that doubling of city size is associated with largeproductivity gains of 3-8 per cent, i.e., moving from a city of 100,000inhabitants to one of 10 million is predicted to increase productivity bymore than 40 per cent. These benefits emanate from the proximity toproduct as well as labour markets; proximity provides savings in trade and38transport costs on the one hand and the availability of skilled labour on theother hand. Economic concentration economises on infrastructureinvestment that would have been larger had it been spread out over alarger part of the country. Thus, the evidence suggests that urbanagglomerates provide large productivity gains. Accordingly, substantialimprovement in the quality, governance and management of urbaninfrastructure in the country is essential for India to maintain andaccelerate the momentum of economic growth and productivity.Human Resource DevelopmentFinally, substantial improvements in primary and secondaryeducational facilities available in the country will be necessary toaccelerate the current growth momentum as well as to reap the benefits ofthe expected demographic dividend. Moreover, a renewed emphasis onquality higher education is necessary in view of the greater concentrationof economic activities in the skill-intensive sectors, both in the industry andthe services.Fiscal ResponsibilityThe success in achieving fiscal consolidation, as observed earlier,has been mixed since the early 1990s. Against this backdrop, theprogress on fiscal consolidation in the past three years is heartening.Indeed, the turnaround in public sector savings of 4.2 percentage points –from a negative 2.0 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to a positive 2.2 per centin 2004-05 – has been the predominant factor in improvement of overallsavings to above 29 per cent and of investment rate to above 30 per cent.Fiscal consolidation is expected to improve savings further while alsopermitting productivity and efficiency gains as more resources becomeavailable for the private sector.39The progress in Central Government finances during the first fivemonths of 2006-07 (April-August 2006) indicates that the key deficitindicators, as proportion to budget estimates, were higher than in thecorresponding period of 2005-06. The widening of deficits was essentiallyon account of large growth in non-Plan revenue expenditures - higherinterest payments, higher food and fertiliser subsidies and grants to States- which more than offset the buoyant tax collections under corporation tax,income tax and customs duties. The Government has, however, reiteratedthat the deficit targets set under the FRBM would be met with an eveningout of revenues and expenditures over the course of the year.Given the downward rigidity in revenue expenditure andsluggishness in non-tax receipts, the scope for deepening fiscalempowerment lies in improving tax revenue. In this context, the reversal ofthe declining trend in gross tax-GDP ratio is welcome. Gross tax/GDPratio of the Centre after falling to a low of 8.2 per cent in 2001-02 hassince increased to 11.2 per cent, the highest since 1990-91.  Thisincreasing trend needs to be maintained through further widening of thetax base and curtailment in tax exemptions. Larger deficit reductions in2007-08 and 2008-09 will be required to meet the FRBM targets. As theReserve Bank in its latest Annual Report has observed, adhering to theFRBM targets in respect of fiscal deficit and revenue deficit is critical formacroeconomic, financial, external sector and budgetary sustainability. Itis essential to eliminate revenue deficit and generate sufficient revenuesurplus which may be utilised for asset creation without creating liabilities.Any slippage in achieving the FRBM targets could erode the gainsachieved in the initial year of the FRBM. It could also generate a chaineffect at the State levels to relax targets set out in their fiscal responsibilitylegislations. Any deviation from the FRBM targets will have both nationaland international repercussions in terms of credibility.40As in the case of the Centre, the States will also need to focus onfiscal empowerment, i.e., expand the scope and size of revenue flows intobudget. In particular, augmenting non-tax revenues through appropriateuser charges and restructuring of State public sector undertakings (PSUs)continues to be of critical importance. Higher user charges will, however,not be feasible unless there is a greater efficiency in the delivery of theservices provided by the States. Therefore, improving delivery of publicservices should be a priority for the State Governments.The various measures aimed at improving tax collections areexpected to reduce revenue deficits of the Government sector. Thecombined revenue deficit must be brought to zero in order to release moreresources for investment, both by the public and the private sectors.Public Services DeliveryGiven the large infrastructure requirements and given the publicgood nature of such projects, the public sector will always have significantpresence in the provision of infrastructure. Thus, infrastructural projectssuch as roads, urban infrastructure (water supply, sewerage, publiclighting and urban transportation), railways and ports and airports willcontinue to need to be funded by public sector funds, although in somecases there is some scope for private sector in areas such as railways.This requires greater focus on improvement in delivery of public services.41
