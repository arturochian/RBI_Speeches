Banks Must build a Structure to provide Superior and Efficient Customer Service 
 
Respected Shri Mahajan, Smt Rama Bijapurkar, member, Governing Council, Banking 
Standards Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI), Shri  N Raja, CEO, BCSBI and banker 
colleagues. At the very outset, I thank Shri Mahajan, Chairman, BCSBI for the kind invitation to 
address Principal Code Compliance Officers of the BCSBI, this afternoon. I attach a great deal 
of value to this interaction. The day long deliberations will provide you the opportunity to 
? Brainstorm with PCCOs of the member banks on issues relating to Code 
implementation. 
? Discuss how to raise the bar for customer service in your own banks.  
? Share experiences and good practices. 
The Banking Codes and Standards Board of India is an autonomous and independent body set 
up by the Reserve Bank. BCSBI is mandated to evolve Codes and Standards for banks to follow 
while dealing with their customers so as to ensure that the customers are enabled certain 
minimum standards of customer service.  BCSBI has developed two sets of Codes for member 
banks viz.  
1. Code of Bank’s Commitment to Customers and  
2. Code of Bank’s Commitment to Micro and Small Enterprises  
These Codes are periodically reviewed and revised in order to reflect the extant regulatory 
guidelines, contemporary developments in the banking sector and evolving customer 
expectations.

 Consumer confidence and trust in a well-functioning market for financial services promotes 
financial stability, growth efficiency and innovation over the long term.

Financial consumer protection, when reinforced with financial inclusion and financial literacy, 
will lead to enhanced financial stability. We have had a great thrust on financial inclusion; as a 
result, several new consumers of banking products have come into the banking system. We 
have to ensure adequate customer protection for these new users of banking services. We 
have to help them through financial education, literacy and awareness to use the diverse range 
of products and services offered by the banks. Awareness of the customer has to be increased. 
With greater awareness of customers, must come, heightened responsibility of the provider of 
financial services. Please appreciate that today RBI, BCSBI and banks are all working under a 
greater lens of public scrutiny and under Right To Information. Implementing the consumer 
protection framework in such an environment necessitates that banks have complete 
knowledge of products and services offered and treat their customers fairly. This idea by itself 
does not mean much to the customers unless it is set against metrics enshrined in standards 
and codes. 
 
Through customer protection initiatives banks must ensure adequate protection of rights of 
their individual, vulnerable, small customers. As Dr Raghuram Rajan expressed in his Seminal 
Report, A Hundred Small Steps - Report of the Committee on Financial Sector Reforms and I 
quote “Consumer protection is important. Not every household is fully cognisant of the 
transactions they enter into. While the line between excessive paternalism and appropriate 
individual responsibility is always hard to draw in a developing country like ours, it may well 
veer to a little more paternalism in interactions between financial firms and less sophisticated 
households”. In his much acclaimed book “Fault Lines”, the Governor has addressed the issue 
2 
 of multiple fault lines caused by a sophisticated, amoral and competitive financial sector. We 
need to guard against such fault lines by ensuring that our banking sector which has done well 
so far continues to do so. We have a banking system which abides by the laws, which is 
sensitive and empathetic to the needs of customers and has a robust grievance redress 
mechanism. 
 
The Pan India Banking Ombudsman Scheme functions as an inexpensive, swift grievance 
redress mechanism. Banking Ombudsman has to work through the processes of conciliation 
mediation and adjudication. Here, the nodal officer has an important role to play. The rules 
require that the banks must first examine the complaint and try to resolve it. It is necessary for 
the nodal officer to give a swift revert on the complaint to the Banking Ombudsman. It is also 
essential for the nodal officer to do a root cause analysis and drill down to the specific cause of 
the complaint to ensure that the same is addressed. For every complaint that is received, there 
may be several such irritants across branches, or there may even be a systemic issue 
underlying the complaints which may be serious. 
All the member banks have adopted these codes, drawn up in consultation with the member 
banks through IBA. At ground level, the position of code implementation is not satisfactory. 
Complaints received by Banking Ombudsman Offices across the country and also through 
interactions with customers in Town Hall meetings by both Banking Ombudsmen and BCSBI 
clearly reflect the need to raise the benchmark for customer service through more effective 
implementation of these codes.  
BCSBI monitors and assesses the compliance with its codes and standards. These 
assessments bring into sharp focus the flagrant violations of the code and shortcomings in 
code implementation. This aspect merits serious attention by PCCOs. 10% of the member 
banks rated by BCSBI in 2012-13 have good rating, with 52% earning Above Average and 
38% earning Average/Below Average ratings.  These clearly show that a number of banks 
need to tone up their code implementation and thereby fulfill their commitments to their 
customers in terms of the codes.  
 
According to the category-wise data on complaints sourced from all 15 offices of Banking 
Ombudsmen, majority of complaints were regarding credit/ debit cards fallowed by non-
observance of the fair practices code, deposits account, failure of commitments made under 
the BCSBI code and pensions.  There is serious concern on the number of complaints, though 
3 
 the disposal rate may be 95%. I find that there are several violations of the BCSBI codes. This 
is not a situation of comfort for the RBI and difficult to comprehend as the banks have 
voluntarily accepted the codes formulated by the BCSBI.

In a sense, BCSBI is functioning as a self-regulatory organization. There is a need to improve 
customer services in public sector banks across all spheres of banking and particularly in areas 
related to deposits accounts, loan and advances, failure of commitments made, non-adherence 
to the BCSBI code and pension. In addition, services related to credit/debit cards, which have 
been subject to frequent complaints from customers in recent years, need to be improved 
across all banks groups. With the advent of technology, there is a need to further strengthen 
customer service in areas of net and mobile banking to enhance customer confidence in these 
technologies. There is a further need to improve the customer data base, which apart from 
facilitating banks to acquaint themselves with the whereabouts of the customers, would help 
them to prevent incidents of fraud/money-laundering. 
 
Complaints related to unauthorized fund transfers, fraudulent withdrawals from ATMs using 
duplicate cards, phishing E-mails aimed at extracting personal information have registered 
significant increase in recent times. Going forward, there is a need for building up a robust 
mechanism to prevent incidents of fraud in areas of mobile/net banking and electronic fund 
transfer.

Treating customers fairly, “TCF”, also must ensure that there is a clear specification of liability, if 
things go wrong. Simplicity of the product sold must be ensured and there is a duty to inform the 
customer about the features of the product. Mis-selling will invite consequences. Banks must 
help customers fully understand the features, benefits, risks and costs of the financial products 
they buy, minimize sale of unsuitable products by encouraging best practice before, during and 
after the sale The sense of protection which consumers expect and experience while dealing 
with banks is the benchmark against which we need to evaluate our customer care and 
customer service policulture of customer-centricity and sensitivity to the needs of the customers 
especially those belonging to the vulnerable sections of the society.  The market forces, 
competition, technology will continue to help banks achieve better penetration and extend their 
reach, but these attributes must also result in better, affordable and easy access to banks and 
banking. As Dr. Rajan puts it, we need a frugal model. We all need to enshrine basic rights for 
all financial services consumers by way of a Charter of bank customers’ rights. 
 
FSLRC has expressed that all financial laws and regulations must protect the interests of the 
consumers. It recommends a framework for customer protection against mis-selling and 
defrauding through the fine print stealth banking etc. We must protect customers against unfair 
contract terms, unjust conduct and protection of personal information through fair disclosure and 
redress of consumer complaints by financial services providers. 
 
Annual Policy Statement released on April 1, 2014 by Dr Rajan, Governor RBI has clearly spelt 
out that consumer protection is an integral aspect of financial inclusion. The Reserve Bank 
proposes to frame comprehensive consumer protection regulations based on domestic 
experience and global best practices. The banks that have internalized the codes enunciated by 
the BCSBI may not have much difficulty in adapting to the new statutory framework. The 
statutory framework also comes with explicit rights, the customers enjoy and the implicit duties 
that are cast on the banker.  
 
The Nachiket Mor Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and 
Low Income Households has pointed out and I quote “When the fact is considered that 
imbalances in information, expertise and power between the buyer and seller of financial 
products will only be exacerbated in the future then it becomes clear that, existing approaches 
to customer protection have severe limitations. The ‘Caveat Emptor’ principle has led to 
6 
 fundamental flaws in our present consumer protection architecture. From the principle of 
“Caveat Emptor”’, Let the Buyer beware, we have to move to the principle ‘Caveat Venditor’, 
Latin for ‘Let the Seller Beware’. It is a counter to ‘Caveat Emptor’ and suggests that seller can 
also be deceived in a market transaction. This forces the seller to take responsibility for the 
product and discourages sellers from purveying products of inferior quality. The principle vests 
the burden of proving that the shortcoming, deficiency of service was absent, on the seller of the 
product. So what should be the framework governing customer protection? 
 
Fairness 
Transparency Suitability 
Existence of a Grievance Clear Specification of Simplicity of the product 
Redress Process Liability if things go wrong Duty to inform of changes 
 
 
We need to enshrine these principles in a Customer’s Charter of Rights and duties of banks 
towards their customers. ‘Caveat Venditor’ will necessitate these. Last but not the least; banks 
must focus on improving the skillsets of staff and front-line managers who are face of the bank 
for the customers.  With increasing competition, banks that survive and succeed will be the ones 
that provide quality service. Research studies have repeatedly shown that customers are willing 
to pay for quality service. 
 
Banks that wish to stay ahead must therefore systematically build a structure that aims at 
providing total quality service which is superior and efficient. I wish your deliberations all 
success and close with the hope that, these will have an impact far beyond immediate issue. 
Thank you for a patient hearing.
