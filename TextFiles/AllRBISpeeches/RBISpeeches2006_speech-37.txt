????Reflections on India’s economic developmentFriends,I am greatly honoured by the invitation from the Council on Foreign Relations tointeract with you as part of the C. Peter McColough Series on InternationalEconomics. I intend sharing with you reflections on India’s economic development, notin terms of advocacy or analysis but through a liberal recourse to anecdotes alongwith some illustrations. By virtue of my experience and background, the remarks maycombine a worm’s view with a bird’s eye-view of the Indian economy, in its broadersocial context.In the presentation today, I will –(a) Provide glimpses of the process of some of the institution building in India thatenabled the progress we have made;(b) Analyse the current macro-economic issues as identified by our recentmonetary policy statements;(c) Assess the outlook for the Indian economy by inviting attention to changingbalances;(d) Illustrate the importance of balance and harmony with reference to reforms inthe external and financial sectors; and(e) Conclude with a discussion on some factors relevant to the prospects for Indiain the global economy.Institution BuildingAmong the institutions that constitute strong pillars of current optimism ongrowth prospects over the long term are: uniquely flexible federalism,  democracy withuniversal adult suffrage, and coexistence of public and private sector. They deservesome elaboration.At the time of independence, there were genuine apprehensions as to whetherIndia would hold together. It is true that at the time of independence, there were over500 native or princely states, which had a complex net of relationships with thecolonial government in terms of paramountcy. They had to be integrated into aconstitutional framework of a federation. The flexibility of the federal structure in the                                           ? Address by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, RBI at the Council on Foreign Relations at New York on May12, 2006.2constitution assimilated divergent tendencies as they evolved through a process ofpolitical accommodation. For example, in the year 2000, three new States werecarved out. We are a Union of States but a number of States had to be created or re-created on several occasions, while boundaries were also altered in some cases.India, as per the constitution, started with Hindi as the official language of the unionalong with English as an alternate, for a defined period, which again is beingextended. The constitution lists national languages which were 14 in 1950 and arenow expanded to 22. Every currency note that we print has denomination expressedin most of these national languages. In brief, India has worked hard to build itself intothe viable and vibrant political entity that it is today in a short period while encouragingdemocracy to take roots.The constitution of USA or the developments in UK first established democracyand then gradually conceded to universal adult suffrage over the passage of a coupleof centuries.  India started with universal adult suffrage in 1950 and over the decadesthere has been democratic pressure for rapid and full inclusion of all sections in themainstream. Other democracies started with equality and conceded affirmativeactions as a concession to realities. India asserted the goal of equality butincorporated enabling affirmative actions in the constitution for a specific period –which has been extended from time to time by common consent. Thus, democracyhas taken roots in India essentially because of, what Stephen Cohen calls, the geniusof Indian people for political accommodation and management.The expansion of the public sector since independence in this milieu of socio-political transformation has been a major contributor to today’s strengths. Expandededucational opportunities, with nominal fees, led to high quality in education.  Peoplecould take advantage of the educational opportunities since the process wasaccompanied by expanding job-opportunities in the public sector, based mainly onperformance.  In this background, millions were convinced that they needed to workhard at education to be assured of vertical economic and social mobility.  The vastpublic sector has also ensured the mobility of the middle class on a nationwide basisand has guaranteed a vibrant middleclass. This, in turn, produced skilled workers andprofessionals as well as a large consumer base and a potential entrepreneurial class.The large public sector has co-existed with a private sector though the growth ofprivate sector was sometime enabled and often constrained, by the public sector. Theprivate sector, for its part, learnt to manage, survive and benefit from the public sectorwhile also being constrained by it.  In brief, it is the combination of federalism,3democracy and the mixed economy that produced a pan-Indian vibrant middleclass ofprofessionals and entrepreneurs.Thus was built an inclusive democracy that virtually celebrates plurality and yetpromotes a self-respecting nation proud of its unity in diversity. We believe thateconomic development needs to be viewed in this broader context. Prime MinisterManmohan Singh summed up the idea in this very forum – Council on ForeignRelations on September 24, 2004, in the context of Russel C. Leffingwell Lecture :“This, (impressive performance) of course is the result of sustained efforts, overthe past 50 years to build those institutions that provide the underpinnings ofeconomic development over the longer term, efforts that began early on as partof the vision of India’s first prime-minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. It is also the resultof economic reforms which have increased our competitiveness in recentyears.”Select current issuesThough there are several issues relevant to our economy, in the monetarypolicy statements in January 2006 as well as April 2006, the Reserve Bank of Indiaflagged three issues as critical for maintaining the momentum of growth with stability,namely, the physical infrastructure, fiscal deficit, and agriculture.First, the poor state of the physical infrastructure, both in terms of quantity andquality, has been rightly agitating the business class and the policy-makers. There aresome reasons to expect a satisfactory outcome, provided the improvement inregulatory framework is sustained. The current investments are demand-led andtherefore, are likely to have a short-gestation coupled with a rapid payback oncompletion. Technological developments and rapid enhancement of domesticconstruction capabilities should aid the process of speedy and efficientimplementation. Given the healthy fundamentals of the domestic financial sector andthe enhanced interest of foreign investors, funding should not be a serious problem.When I mentioned my optimistic assessment on these lines in Basel, one of thecomments was “with miserable infrastructure, India is already competitive in manyareas. I should wonder what happens if the infrastructure really improves".Second, fiscal consolidation is taking place both at the Centre and States andthere is greater consensus now on the broad directions. The recent budget of thecentral government brings the consolidation on track, targeting a fiscal deficit of threeper cent by 2009 while eliminating revenue deficit. Recommendations of the TwelfthFinance Commission (Chairman, Dr. C. Rangarajan) have reinforced the process to4enable further fiscal consolidation at the State level. Our studies on State finances inReserve Bank of India give grounds for optimism in regard to their fiscal health. From2003-04, there has been a sharp correction both in the revenue and fiscal deficits; andthe process of correction is primarily due to buoyancy in revenue receipts, States’ owntax revenue as well as transfer and devolution of resources from Centre. It isnoteworthy that for all the States together, the revenue deficit relative to the GDP isestimated to decline to 0.4 per cent in the current year from one per cent in theprevious year and 2.7 per cent in 1990-2000. The corresponding picture for the GrossFiscal Deficit relative to the GDP is 3.1 per cent compared to 3.7 per cent in theprevious year and 4.7 per cent in 1990-2000.  However, the issues of power subsidiesand ensuring quality in the delivery of services, especially with regards to educationand health, do need to be addressed.Third, and perhaps the most difficult, is agriculture. A majority of the workforceis dependent on agriculture while the GDP growth due to agriculture is marginallyabove the rate of growth of the population, in contrast to a strong growth rate in thenon-agriculture sector. This has generated an understandably widespread feeling ofabsolute as well as relative deprivation among the farmers and the agricultural labour.While the scope for better terms in the global trading environment is still elusive, Indiahas a large enough domestic market to facilitate a more rapid growth in agriculture.Yet, legislative, institutional and attitudinal changes to supplement enhanced publicand private investment may be needed. The Reserve Bank, for its part, is redoublingits efforts in revitalising the rural cooperative credit system, in strengthening RegionalRural Banks, in providing incentives to commercial banks for investments in ruraleconomy and in ensuring an adequate and timely delivery of credit at an appropriateprice. In fact, we are mounting a study of legislation and implementation of non-institutional money lending, as it is the single largest source of credit for the farmers.Outlook: Changing balancesProgress in India is essentially one of shifting balances. These balances shiftalmost continuously, and often imperceptibly, and it is possible to hold that one way ofassessing the outlook for the Indian economy would be to appreciate these changingbalances.  First, there is a changing balance in the debates on economic reforms. So far,the discussions have percolated from the English media to the vernacular (with thedivide between the English media and the vernacular corresponding roughly to a5socio-economic/urban-rural divide). It is interesting to note that while 17 leadingEnglish newspapers have a combined circulation of 6.3 million and readership of 17.9million, 54 leading vernacular newspapers in India have a circulation of 21.4 millionand a readership of 197.2 million. Important economic issues are more and morelikely to be articulated and shaped by the vernacular media and distilled up to theEnglish media, since it is the vernacular that predominantly represents the rising 200million middleclass.Second, there are changes in the vertical balance between Central andprovincial or State governments. The trend towards globalisation results in many ofthe discretionary powers of the Union government in the economic area becomingaligned with bilateral or multilateral requirements while critical areas for role ofgovernment in the economy like law and order, education, health, power, water, etc.,remain substantively in the domain of the provinces.  That a few years ago, many inthe world would not have heard of State chief ministers while they do so now, points toan increasing decentralisation of economic reforms.  Third, the horizontal inter-provincial balance is also changing.  Now, States arecompeting for private investments - the drivers of growth – whether domestic orforeign. A competition among the States for the Central government assistance on thebasis of backwardness or need, has been replaced with competition for privateinvestments facilitating growth.Fourth, within governments both at the union and provincial levels, regulatoryagencies are expanding their role to reduce the discretionary or possible pro-politicalcycle authority of governments.Fifth, the most dynamic element of reform is the mix between public and privateownership of enterprises. The rebalancing of public enterprises is not dramatic but theentry and threat of the private sector and a diversified ownership of public enterprisesthrough partial disinvestment have meant a change in both the operating environmentand internal business culture of these enterprises – which, until recently, hademployed and retained the largest pool of the best and the brightest. It is no wonderthat the equity markets in India have given a big ‘thumbs up’ to many publicenterprises, including banks.Sixth, the enormous and growing diversity in the funding and provision ofessential services, such as health and education, is worth exploring. The enrolment inprivate schools or colleges, often funded through grants-in-aid, exceeds that in publicsector in many States. On the one hand, this is positive - since the fees are currently6affordable, but on the other, it is a cause for concern since it implies that the publicsector is not able to deliver.  In the short term, this is a waste of resources and in thelong term has the potential for undermining the greatest strength of India – a crediblehope for millions, particularly the poor and under privileged, that there is a bettertomorrow through better education.  The enhancement of the quality of education –primary, secondary and collegiate – in the large public sector is a most difficult yetcrucial challenge. Some efforts are being made in this regard by many, such as AzimPremji - the Chairman of one of the largest software companies in India – and theTatas, one of the largest industrial houses in India. Ensuring access to qualityeducation for the underprivileged in India is an issue that should be of greatestconcern to all thoughtful and concerned people of the world.  Similar concerns can beraised with regard to the vital area of public health. Here, the private sector is analternative, though often not an affordable one for most Indians. I am happy to notethe efforts of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as the participation ofMcKinsey’s Rajat Gupta in the Public Health Foundation of India.Seventh, there is a dramatic though not fully appreciated rebalancing within theprivate sector in terms of what may be called the “professionalisation” of industrialhouses. A new, highly qualified and professional generation of leadership hasreplaced the older order in established industrial houses. At the same time, there hasbeen an explosion of an entirely new set of industry leaders, particularly, in newerfields such as software, pharmaceuticals, biotech and financial services. Theprofessionalisation is also accompanied by the globalisation of the operations of theIndian industrial houses.Eighth, sometimes it is argued that large size is absent in the Indian industry,but it is the wide spectrum of size and diversity that imparts dynamism and generatesan entrepreneurial class as well as employment.  In the recently held Davos summit,an Indian industrialist referred to two aspects of our business environment.  He saidthat Indian business is often faced with chaos and out of chaos comes creativity.  Headded that the cost per unit of output may often not be very low in India, but the costper unit of innovation is!Ninth, the relationship between labour and management is being graduallyrebalanced. It has certainly improved since the 1991 reform. The recent data onstrikes and number of working days lost bear testimony to the maturity and wisdom ofall concerned. Often, the labour market is cited as a problem but many globallycompetitive Indian businesses do not seem to perceive it as an insurmountable one.7Further, the implementation of provisions relating to labour market under the IndustrialDisputes Act, which is broadly in line with international standards, is becoming morepragmatic and less dogmatic in many progressive States. However, the need forgreater labour flexibility with attendant appropriate legislative changes, keeping inview the socio-economic conditions, is undeniable.Tenth, there is often a concern about jobless growth, but in reality it isnecessary to distinguish between lack-lustre growth in employment in the organisedsector and expansion and intensification of employment in the unorganised sector. Byway of illustration, thirty years ago, eighty per cent of engineers or doctors moved intothe organised sector, while now, sixty to seventy per cent are self-employed. Thisimplies a shift in the balance from what may be termed as ‘job orientation’ to ‘workorientation’. Despite these positive developments, the greatest challenge before thenation is to create productive work for the millions that are entering the market.Finally, during the process of reform there is an initial tendency to be pro-business to get quick results while for lasting impact, policy needs to be pro-market.The processes of decision-making, often considered painfully slow in India, aregradually emphasising an increasingly pro-market stance.Reforms in External and Financial Sectors : Balance and HarmonyWhat are the dominant characteristics of reform in the external sector? On thetrade account, the approach was to indicate the direction and to encourageparticipants to equip themselves better, notwithstanding the risks of anticipatoryactions undermining the policy intent. In this context, a distinction needs to be madebetween promoting growth and enhancing efficiency in the context of economicreforms. Trade reforms in India were designed to enable domestic firms to restructureand spread the costs of adjustments over time – thus enabling enhanced efficiencythrough a gradual process. Growth is promoted on a longer-term basis in view ofefficiency gains that were made possible by the gradualist approach.On the capital account also, there has been a continuous resetting with a viewto the accelerating gradual pace of liberalisation depending on the domestic andglobal situation but the direction has not been compromised. While there is fullconvertibility on the current account, and also for all authorised inflows as well asoutflows on the capital account, the process of managing the capital account consistsof operating two routes, namely automatic and non-automatic.  As far as foreign directinvestment is concerned, consistent rebalancing in the desired direction is done by8expanding the automatic route and by moving most of the prohibited transactions tothe non-automatic but approval route and at a later stage, to an automatic orderegulated regime.  There is full convertibility for portfolio flows through ForeignInstitutional Investors as far as equity markets are concerned.  A major area ofmanaging the capital account relates to external debt and the objective in this regardis, in a way, to ensure that short-term debt obligations conform to what is known asGuidotti-Greenspan prescription for avoiding crisis in the emerging economies.  Asregards residents, a distinction is made between resident individuals, the corporates,and financial intermediaries - and a process of gradual liberalisation for each category,as appropriate, is the general approach.  Currently, there is virtually full capitalaccount convertibility for Indian corporates while a roadmap for the future in regard tofuller capital account convertibility is expected from a recently appointed committee onthe subject, by end-July 2006.The emphasis on balance and gradual rebalancing, keeping in view the desireddirection and the need to avoid any roll-back, is thus evident in regard to the externalsector and is equally significant for progress in the financial sector -basically followingthe visionary design of Dr. C. Rangarajan, one of my predecessors.  A few illustrationsof gradualism may be in order.First, the Reserve Bank was, till recently, de facto obliged to provide money tothe government whenever needed, be it through overdrafts or through privateplacement of government debt with the Reserve Bank or through participation in theprimary issues.  These have been eliminated with effect from April of this year, but theformal process was commenced in 1997, with a memorandum of understanding withthe Government to eliminate automatic monetisation. More recently, private placementor participation was avoided.  After being convinced that the new system works inpractice, it has been possible to discharge the relevant mandate of the FiscalResponsibility and Budget Management Act with effect from April 2006.A second example relates to relaxations in foreign exchange regulations.  TheForeign Exchange Regulations Act, 1973 prohibited most of the forex transactionsunless exempted, and so, the initial process of liberalisation involved enlarging the listof exemptions. This culminated in replacing the above Act with the Foreign ExchangeManagement Act in June 2000, where all transactions are permitted unless prohibitedor regulated.A third example relates to competition and ownership of banks.  Competitionhas been enhanced by gradually removing administered interest rate structures,9permitting entry of new private sector banks, and expanding the branch network offoreign banks.  Unlike in most countries, a branch of a foreign bank in India canconduct any business that a bank incorporated in India may do.  On ownership, whileover 70% of the banking business was in fully public sector-owned banks ten yearsago, it is now less than 10%, since there is a mix of public and private ownership inmost of the public sector banks.  In fact, in many large public sector banks, foreignownership is close to domestic private ownership.  The two largest private sectorbanks have foreign ownership of about 70%.  The shares of most domestic banks arequoted and traded in local stock exchanges and if stock market is any indication of theoutlook, the prospects for public sector banks are bright.In this process of reform in the banking sector, the legacy problem of non-performing assets were managed by the public sector banks themselves - with nobanking crisis or ex post fiscal bail out.  The government has actually benefited fromthe infusion of some capital in the public sector banks which was done to comply withthe Reserve Bank's prudential regulations. By all accounts, the banking system as awhole has improved in terms of efficiency and resilience gradually, with the mixbetween public and private and domestic and foreign banks, changing incrementallyto enable non-disruptive enhancement of competitive efficiency and stability.Along with continuous rebalancing within each sector, harmony in reformsacross sectors is continuously sought.  In a way, the complex tasks of timing andsequencing of reforms in India have been managed through continuous rebalancingwithin a broadly harmonised policy-framework, often incrementally and rarely in adramatic fashion.  For example, the progress in reforms in monetary management andfinancial sectors has been impressive, and in the external sector, de facto, verysignificant.  Progress in the fiscal sector has not been as rapid, influencing the pace ofreform in the financial and external sectors.  Similarly, flexibilities in the real economyare necessary if the fruits of marketisation are to be obtained without the attendantrisks.  Several rigidities, especially in the regulatory environment and the agriculturesector, are being gradually removed and reform in other sectors cannot be out of tune.Finally, clarity in property rights, enforcement, dispute resolution etc., on anexpeditious and reasonably predictable basis is also being pursued on several fronts,so that further progress can be made – say, in pricing of risks by banks as efficientlyas they happen in developed economies.Our experience in regard to development and regulation of financial marketsdiffers from that of developed economies.  The latter experienced a co-development of10markets, regulations, and practices within the economies and at a latter stage, througha process of evolution, integrated first domestically, and finally, globally.  In our case,non-existent or underdeveloped domestic market participants had to change theiroutlook rapidly.  The regulators had to develop the requisite skills, and the self-regulatory organisations needed to be founded and strengthened. All these had totake place with narrower degrees of freedom and in a shorter time-span, in view ofglobal developments and financial integration with its pre-disposed as well aspreferred frameworks.  The constant plea for the country context in reforms in thefinancial sector may be viewed in this analytical framework.India and global economyThere are several complex factors relating to domestic economy that wouldinfluence the manner in which India will evolve in and integrate with global economy inthe long run. While it is beyond the scope of this address to attempt analysing them, itis proposed to discuss some of these domestic factors namely, trade offs betweenefficiency and stability; importance of political stability, process of empowerment ofwomen, governance issues and demographic transition.  The balancing of efficiency considerations with stability will be critical in India'ssuccessful integration into the global economy. While several observers, especially inthe financial sector, hold that India is risk-averse, there are others who assert that arisk-sensitive approach has paid rich dividends both in terms of efficiency as well asstability.  Two illustrations may suffice.  At a macro level, India is investing around30% of GDP and recording a GDP growth rate in the range of 7% to 8% - whichreflects a high level of macro-efficiency relative to other high growth performers inAsia.  Second, at a micro-level, there is evidence of increasing global competitiveness- in particular, in the manufacturing industry despite several handicaps such as thecost per unit of power in India, which is two to three times higher than that in otherAsian countries.  Also, savings-investment balance is - and perhaps likely to be -reasonable at around 2 to 3% of GDP as current account deficit.  Going forward,India's risk-sensitive approach to management may ensure that it contributes todomestic growth and global stability.Issues of political stability are closely related to those of economic stability  -and the stability of the political system in India is noteworthy.  The number of coalitionpartners in the government, number of prime ministers and indeed, of a series ofelections to the Parliament and State assemblies in recent years may appear to11indicate difficult political cycles. Yet the overall progress in economic and, indeed,social fronts in the recent years, despite the apparently tortuous processes,demonstrates that economic policy cycles do not necessarily go with political cycles inIndia.  There are grounds for optimism on the continued optimal balancing betweensocio-economic change and political system stability.No doubt, terrorism is a serious problem but it is a localised problem and theessential fairness of an open multi-cultural society provides hope against any lastingadverse impact on stability.  It is significant that there have been attacks on the iconicsymbols of India - Parliament, temple, mosque and the Indian Institute of Science.And in all these cases, evidence is that it was driven by the non-residents.It is useful to recognise the importance of empowerment of women. Let meillustrate with some relevant facts in my home State, Andhra Pradesh.  There is areservation of one-third for women in medical colleges, but as of now, around half thestudents are women. Of the 92,000 students admitted in engineering colleges thisyear in Andhra Pradesh, over 30,000 were women. Similarly in the political arena,women are well represented. In the local bodies, there are about 250,000 electedofficials ranging from a member of Gram Panchayat to Mayors of MunicipalCorporation and chairpersons of Zilla Parishads and of these, over 85,000 arewomen; and the reservation for women has been operative since 1987.  Thesedevelopments, which are shared in different ways by other States, give a positive twistto the outlook for empowerment of women for the future.The exploration on the future of India will not be complete without reference toa book by my predecessor Dr. Bimal Jalan with the title 'Future of India : Politics,Economics and Governance'.  In particular, he highlights issues relating to enhancingthe quality of functioning of the parliament, the bureaucracy and the judiciary.  Theseare complex issues, but the continuation of the good times in the economy is perhapscontingent upon the needed reforms in these areas - sooner rather than later.India is expected to benefit from the demographic dividend in a global context.It is necessary to recognise that the bulge in the workforce, which is a source ofstrength, will be concentrated in Northern provinces of India.  If education, skills,health and governance are improved to enable a globally competitive labour force,there will be a demographic dividend.  There is a greater advantage for India, relativeto almost all other countries, in that the demographic transition in India will bestretched over a longer period due to the sheer diversity in demographic profilesamong different States. By 2016, in three States - Tamilnadu, Kerala and Andhra12Pradesh – the proportion of the elderly as a percentage to the total population will bein excess of 10 per cent.  On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the two mostpopulous States of India, are likely to have the lowest share at 6.7 per cent and 7.1per cent respectively.  A preliminary observation based on the migration data as perCensus 2001 shows that Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the two States alreadyexperiencing the highest number of people emigrating to other States in India.Employment appears to be the dominant factor for migration and this is a positivefactor for us.  In brief, the demographic profile of India may, in some ways, bemimicking the global profile.It is interesting that the extreme diversities of the world in terms of languages,religions, ideologies and traditions are reflected in India.  There is an overwhelmingpreference in Indian society and polity for coordination, cooperation and co-optionrather than confrontation.  In sum, if there is one country that is closest to a wellfunctioning, multi-cultural global village, it is India.Indo-US RelationsIn conclusion, some thoughts on Indo-US relations would be in order. The singlelargest segment of the best and the brightest of India residing outside the country is inthe USA, and their assimilation is both smooth and productive. An important source ofoverseas students in the USA is from India, and the Indian-Americans carry thegoodwill for the USA wherever they happen to be. These are among leaders andopinion makers not only in the USA and in India, but also globally. The single largestgroup of non-resident Indian professionals returning to India to participate in thegrowth story of India are from the USA. Finally, as Ambassador Blackwell said in thisvery forum, Council on Foreign Relations on February 23, 2006, in a JournalistRoundtable 'Indians like the United States. According to the Pew Poll, [….] "Indiaregards the United States more positively than any other country in the world, it turnsout'.Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
