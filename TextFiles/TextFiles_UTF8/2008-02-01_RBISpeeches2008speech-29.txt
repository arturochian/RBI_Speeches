Capital Flows to India  ? Rakesh Mohan    Introduction  In most of the period since the mid-1990s, external sector developments in India have been  marked by strong capital flows. Capital flows to India, which were earlier mainly confined to small  official concessional finance, gained momentum from the 1990s after the initiation of economic reforms.  Apart from increase in size, capital flows to India have undergone a compositional shift from  predominantly official and private debt flows to non-debt creating flows in the post reform period.  Private debt flows have begun to increase again in the more recent period. Though capital flows are  generally seen to be beneficial to an economy, a large surge in flows over a short span of time in  excess of the domestic absorptive capacity can, however, be a source of stress to the economy giving  rise to upward pressures on the exchange rate, overheating of the economy, and possible asset price  bubbles. In India, capital flows in the past few years have recorded a sharp increase and have been  well above the current account deficit, which has largely remained modest. This has posed new  challenges for monetary and exchange rate management. This paper elaborates on various aspects of  the capital flows to India and their policy implications. The sections have been arranged as follows:  Section I provides a historical backdrop to the evolution of capital flows to India. Section II highlights  various aspects of capital flows to India, anlaysing their trend, magnitude, and composition. Section III  deals with issues on management of capital flows into India and their implications for the conduct of  monetary and exchange rate policies. Section IV highlights some of the major issues and challenges for  the central bank and Section V concludes with the future outlook.     ?

Historical Backdrop  For the first four decades after independence in 1947, the economic policies of the Indian  government were characterized by planning, control and regulation. Until the 1980s, Indias  development strategy was focused on self-reliance and import substitution. There were periodic  attempts at market-oriented reform, usually following balance of payments pressures, which induced  policy responses that combined exchange rate depreciation and an easing of restrictions on foreign  capital inflows. However, the latter were relatively narrow in scope and had little impact on actual  inflows, which remained small. The situation changed dramatically with the onset of reform programs  introduced in the early 1990s in the aftermath of the balance of payments crisis of 1991.    Broadly speaking, Indias approach towards external capital flows could be divided into three  main phases. In the first phase, starting at the time of independence and spanning upto the early  1980s, Indias reliance on external flows was mainly restricted to multilateral and bilateral concessional  finance. Subsequently, however, in the context of a widening current account deficit during the 1980s,  India supplemented this traditional external source of financing with recourse to external commercial  loans including short term borrowings and deposits from non-resident Indians (NRIs). As a result, the  proportion of short term debt in Indias total external debt increased significantly by the late 1980s. The  third phase was marked by the balance of payments crisis of 1991 and the initiation of reform process.  The broad approach to reform in the external sector was based on the recommendations made in the  Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments (Chairman: C. Rangarajan), 1991. The  objectives of reform in the external sector were conditioned by the need to correct the deficiencies that  led to payment imbalances in the 1991. Recognizing that an inappropriate exchange rate regime,  unsustainable current account deficit and a rise in short term debt in relation to the official reserves  were amongst the key contributing factors to the crisis, a series of reform measures were put in place.  The measures included a swift transition to a market determined exchange rate regime, dismantling of  trade restrictions, moving towards current account convertibility and gradual opening up of the capital  account. While liberalizing the private capital inflows, the Committee recommended, inter alia, a  compositional shift in capital flows away from debt to non-debt creating flows; strict regulation of  external commercial borrowings, especially short term debt; discouraging volatile element of flows from  non-resident Indians; and gradual liberalization of outflows.  Among the components, since the 1990s, the broad approach towards permitting foreign direct  investment has been through a dual route, i.e., automatic and discretionary, with the ambit of automatic  route progressively enlarged to almost all the sectors, coupled with higher sectoral caps stipulated for  such investments. Portfolio investments are restricted to institutional investors. The approach to  external commercial borrowings has been one of prudence, with self imposed ceilings on approvals and  a careful monitoring of the cost of raising funds as well as their end use. In respect of NRI deposits,  some modulation of inflows is exercised through specification of interest rate ceilings and maturity  requirements. In respect of capital outflows, the approach has been to facilitate direct overseas  investment through joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries and provision of financial support to  exports, especially project exports from India. Ceilings on such outflows have been substantially  liberalized over time. The limits on remittances by domestic individuals have also been eased. With  progressive opening up of its capital account since the early 1990s, the state of capital account in India  today can be considered as the most liberalized it has ever been in its history since the late 1950s.    In India, capital account liberalisation is considered as a process and it is managed by keeping  in view the elasticities of supply and other responses in the economy, and vulnerabilities or potential for  shocks. The issue of capital account liberalization is handled with extreme caution given the potential  for sudden capital reversal. The Report of the Committee on Capital Account Convertibility, 1997  (Chairman: S.S. Tarapore) provided the initial framework for liberalization of capital account  transactions in India. The Committee recommended a phased implementation of capital account  convertibility in India to be completed by the year 1999-2000. Taking lessons from the international  experience, the Committee suggested a number of pre-conditions, attainment of which was considered  necessary for the success of the capital account liberalization programme in India. Fiscal consolidation,  lower inflation and a stronger financial system were seen as crucial signposts for India. It is interesting  to note that the Committee did not recommend unlimited opening up of the capital account, but  preferred a phased liberalization of controls on outflows and inflows over a three-year period. Even at  the end of the three-year period, capital account was not to be fully open and some flows, especially  debt flows, would continue to be managed.     The issue of capital account liberalization was re-examined by the Committee on Fuller Capital  Account Convertibility (Chairman Shri S.S.Tarapore) (2006), which made several recommendations on  the development of financial markets in addition to addressing issues related to interaction of monetary  policy and exchange rate management, regulation/supervision of banks and the timing and sequencing  of capital account liberalization measures (details in Section III.3). The Committee has recommended  that at the end of the five-year period ending 2010-11, there should be a comprehensive review to chalk  out the future course of action.     II. Trend, Magnitude and Composition of Capital Flows to India  II.1 Trend  Since the introduction of the reform process in the early 1990s, India has witnessed a significant  increase in cross-border capital flows, a trend that represents a clear break from the previous two  decades. The size of net capital flows to India increased from US $ 7.1 billion in 1990-91 to US $ 45.8  billion in 2006-07, and further to US $ 108.0 billion during 2007-08 (Chart 1). India has one of the  highest net capital flows among the emerging market economies (EMEs) of Asia.      II.2 Magnitude    Net capital flows to India, which increased from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to around 9 per  cent in 2007-08, however, do not reflect the true magnitude of capital flows to India. Gross capital  inflows to India, as a percent of GDP, have undergone a more than five-fold increase from 7.2 per cent  in 1990-91 to 36.6 per cent in 2007-08. Much of this increase has been offset by corresponding capital  outflows, largely on account of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) portfolio investment transactions,  Indian investment abroad and repayment of external borrowings. Capital outflows increased from 5.0  per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 27.4 per cent of GDP in 2007-08. The gross volume of capital inflows  amounted to US $ 428.7 billion in 2007-08 as against an outflow of US $ 320.7 billion.      Strong capital flows to India in the recent period reflect the sustained momentum in domestic  economic activity, better corporate performance, positive investment climate, long term view of India as  an investment destination and favourable liquidity and interest rates in the global market. Apart from  this, the prevailing higher domestic interest rate along with a higher and stable growth rate have  created a lower risk perception, which has attracted higher capital inflows.    The large excess of capital flows over and above that required to finance the current account  deficit (which is currently around 1.5 per cent of GDP) resulted in reserve accretion of US $ 110.5 billion  during the financial year 2007-08. Indias total foreign exchange reserves were US$ 308.4 billion as on  July 4, 2008.     II.3 Composition     As regards the composition of capital flows, the thrust of the policy reform in India in the  aftermath of the balance of payment crisis was to encourage non-debt creating flows and discourage  short term debt flows. Accordingly, the composition of capital inflows to India clearly reflects a shift  towards non-debt creating flows. The substantial contribution of external aid towards the capital  account in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s has dwindled steadily since the 1990s (excluding IMF  loans in 1991 and 1992) as the official flows started getting replaced by private equity flows and  external commercial borrowing (Table 1). Although non-debt flows, particularly private foreign  investments have gained in importance, there is also a significant rise in the debt creating flows in last  two years mainly on account of rise in external commercial borrowings by Indian corporates (Table 2).     Non-debt flows  Equity flows under foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investments constitute  the major forms of non-debt creating capital flows to India. There has been a marked increase in the  magnitude of FDI inflows to India since the early 1990s, reflecting the liberal policy regime and growing  investors confidence. Indias share in global FDI flows increased from 2.3 per cent in 2005 to 4.5 per  cent in 2006. Inflows under FDI were particularly high during the last two years, though a large part of it  was offset by significant outflows on account of overseas investment by Indian corporates.

In a major break from the past, the spurt in FDI flows to India in the recent period has been  accompanied by a jump in outward equity investment as Indian firms establish production, marketing  and distribution networks overseas to achieve global scale along with access to new technology and  natural resources. Investment in joint ventures (JV) and wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) abroad has  emerged as an important vehicle for facilitating global expansion by Indian companies. Overseas direct  equity investment from India jumped to US $ 11.3 billion in 2006-07 from US $ 3.8 billion in 2005-06.  Overseas direct equity investment amounted to US $ 12.5 billion during 2007-08. Overseas investment,  though started off initially with the acquisition of foreign companies in the IT and related services sector,  has now spread to other areas such as non-financial services.  A marked feature of FDI flows to India is that unlike the dominance of manufacturing in the East  Asian economies, the FDI to India has concentrated in the services sector. This reflects the service led  growth of the economy and comparative advantage in international trade in services. It may be  mentioned that information technology has enabled greater tradability of a number of business and  professional services. With greater potential for growth in such services, FDI has also emerged as a  vehicle to delivery of services to the international markets. Moreover, within services sector, financing,  insurance, real estate and business services have witnessed a large increase in their share in FDI flows  to India between 2002-03 and 2007-08. Computer services also remains a key sector for FDI as the  mode of captive BPO/subsidiaries have been principal instruments for facilitating offshore delivery of  computer services and IT enabled services.   Like FDI, Indias share in net portfolio flows to emerging market and developing countries has  expanded. India has witnessed a dominance of portfolio flows over FDI flows during various periods of  time, which is in contrast to developing and emerging market economies in most parts of the world,  where FDI constituted the main source of equity flows (Chart 2). However, unlike FDI flows, which  exhibited a more or less steady upward trend over the years, portfolio flows are more volatile, moving in  tandem with domestic and international market sentiments. Accordingly, a sharp rise in portfolio  investment into India in the recent period reflects both global and domestic factors. The search for yield  in view of very low real long term rates in advanced economies has been an important factor driving  portfolio flows to emerging market economies as a group and India also has attracted such flows.  Domestic factors, such as strong macroeconomic fundamentals, resilient financial sector, deep and  liquid capital market, improved financial performance of the corporate sector and attractive valuations  also attracted large portfolio flows. Consistent with the principle of hierarchy of capital flows, India has  been making efforts towards encouraging more inflows through FDI and enhancing the quality of  portfolio flows by strict adherence to know your investor principle (Reddy 2005).  Debt-creating Flows  External assistance, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), trade credits and non-repatriable  component of NRI deposits constitute the major portion of the external debt in India.    External assistance, which consists of external aid flows from bilateral and multilateral sources,  constituted the major source of external financing for India in the 1950s and 1960s. The importance of  external assistance in Indias capital flows has declined steadily during the last three decades as it gave  way to private capital flows. The share of external assistance in Indias total capital flows has declined  from 31.2 per cent in 1990-91 to 1.9 per cent in 2007-08. India, on the other hand has started extending  assistance to other countries, mainly in the form of grants and loans. India provided aid mainly in the  form of technical co-operation and training, with the grant component dominating external aid with a  share of over 90 per cent. The major beneficiaries of the assistance during 2006-07 were Bhutan, Nepal  and Sri Lanka.   The recourse to external commercial borrowings by Indian corporates, though initiated in the  early the 1970s, remained modest due to the dominance of concessional, non-market based finance in  the form of external assistance from bilateral sources and multilateral agencies. Towards the end of the  1970s, the concessionality in the aid flows dwindled. Thus, with the rising external financing  requirements beginning with the 1980s and the recognition that reliance on external assistance was not  favourable, commercial borrowings from international capital markets were preferred. Commercial  borrowings after experiencing some slowdown in the aftermath of the balance of payments crisis, rose  significantly in the latter half of the 1990s, responding to the strong domestic investment demand,  favourable global liquidity conditions, upgrade of sovereign credit rating, lower risk premia on emerging  market bonds, and an upward phase of capital flow cycle to the EMEs. During this period, ECBs  constituted about 30 per cent of the net capital flows to India. Towards the late 1990s and the early  2000s, the demand for ECB remained subdued due to a host of factors such as global economic  slowdown, reversal of a rising phase of capital flows to developing countries and lower domestic investment demand. The period beginning 2003-04 marked the resumption of debt flows to developing  countries, which was a combined outcome of the higher interest rate differential emanating from ample  global liquidity and the robust growth expectations and low risk perception towards the emerging  markets. Net inflows under ECB increased from US $ 2.5 billion in 2005-06 to US $ 16.2 billion in 2006- 07 and further to US $ 22.2 billion during 2007-08. ECB contributed to about 20.5 per cent of the net  capital flows to India in 2007-08. Higher ECB drawals during the past few years reflect sustained  domestic investment demand, import demand, hardening of domestic interest rate as also greater risk  appetite of global investors for emerging market bonds. The policy on ECB is kept under constant review  and changes are made as needed.   In the 1970s, the two oil shocks shifted substantial resources towards oil exporting countries,  which provided investment and employment opportunities in the oil-rich countries. The Reserve Bank  devised specific deposit schemes to tap the savings of non-resident Indians employed in these  countries. Non-Resident Indians/Overseas Corporate Bodies were allowed to open and maintain bank  accounts in India under special deposit schemes-both rupee and foreign currency denominated. NRI  deposits have been a generally stable source of support to Indias balance of payments through the  1990s, although the external payment difficulties of the 1990-91 demonstrated the vulnerability that can  be associated with these deposits in times of difficulty and drastic changes in perceptions. Since the  1990s, the Reserve Bank has aligned the interest rates on these deposits with international rates, fine- tuned the reserve requirements, end-use specifications and other concomitant factors influencing these  deposits in order to modulate these flows consistent with overall macroeconomic management.   As a whole, Indias external debt stock stood at US $ 221.2 billion at the end of March 2008.  Consolidation of Indias external debt position is reflected in terms of steady improvement in Indias debt  sustainability and liquidity indicators. While the ratio of Indias external debt to GDP has declined over  the years from 38.7 per cent in 1991-92 to 18.8 per cent in 2007-08, the debt service ratio declined from  30.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent during the same period (Chart 3). At the end of March 2008, Indias foreign  exchange reserves at US $ 309.7 billion provided a cover of 140 per cent to total external debt, though  there has been a increase in the short term debt in recent years. As regards the composition of external  debt, there has been a distinct decline in the share of Government debt in total external debt as it has  gone down from 43.4 per cent to 26.3 per cent of total external debt between end-March 2001 and end- December 2007, giving way to non-government private external borrowings (Chart 4).      Indias net international liabilities increased from US $ 47.2 billion at the end of March 2004 to  US $ 73.9 billion at the end of December 2007, as the increase in international liabilities (US $ 222.5  billion) exceeded the increase in international assets (US $ 195.7 billion) during the period (Chart 5).  While the increase in the liabilities was mainly due to large capital flows under portfolio investment, FDI  and external commercial loans, the increase in international assets was mainly on account of an  increase in reserve assets, followed by direct investment abroad. A major part of the liabilities, such as  direct and portfolio investment reflects cumulative inflows, which are provided at historical prices. The  value of the liabilities would be much higher if marked to market at current prices. The share of non-debt liabilities to total external financial liabilities has witnessed an increasing trend since end-June 2006. It  has increased from 42.3 per cent at end June 2006 to 50.8 per cent at end-December 2007 due to large  capital inflows under direct and portfolio equity investments. On the other hand debt liabilities, which  include portfolio investment in debt securities and other investment (trade credits, loans, currency and  deposits and other liabilities) declined from 57.7 per cent to 49.2 per cent during the same period.    III. Management of Capital Flows in India  The recent episode of capital flows, which has occurred in the backdrop of current account  surplus in most of the emerging Asian economies, highlights the importance of absorption of capital  flows. A large surge in capital flows over a short span of time in excess of domestic absorptive capacity  of the economy can lead to upward pressure on the exchange rate, possible overheating of the  economy and asset price bubbles. They can also pose the risk of an abrupt reversal, which may have  potential negative real economic effects. The absorption of capital flows is limited by the extant  magnitude of the current account deficit, which has traditionally been low in India, and seldom above 2  per cent of GDP. Given this situation, large capital inflows in excess of a sustained current account  deficit are a stress on the real economy through pressures on exchange rate appreciation and  sterilization. This not only affects exporters, but also affects the profitability of the domestic producers  through pressures on domestic prices, unless productivity goes up commensurately. Real appreciation  of the exchange rate leading to widening of the trade deficit could also lead to a slowdown in economic and industrial growth. Thus, the combination of low domestic absorption and high capital inflows have  posed new challenges for monetary and exchange rate management in India.   In the medium term, a continued focus on financial market development would mitigate the  challenge of capital flows. However, it is important to recognize that maturation of financial markets  takes time. Hence, capital flows have to be managed through other tools in the short term, while  continuing to work on development of financial markets (Reddy 2008a). In response to net capital flows  remaining well in excess of the current account financing need, a multi-pronged approach has been  followed in India to deal with such flows. The policy responses have included, inter alia, phased  liberalization of the policy framework in relation to current as well as capital account outflows; foreign  exchange market intervention and subsequent sterilization; lowering interest rate ceilings on NRI  deposits; management of external debt through pre-payment and moderation in the access of  corporates and intermediaries to additional external debt; and greater flexibility in exchange rate  movements.  III.1 Capital Flows and Exchange Rate Management  In India, with gradual removal of restrictions on international capital flows and greater integration  of financial markets with global financial markets, the task of understanding the precise nature of casual  relationship among capital flows, exchange rate, interest rate and reactions of monetary policy has  certainly become more complex. The response lag of the exchange rate and domestic liquidity to  monetary policy actions in the form of direct intervention in the exchange market as well as changes in  the short-term policy rates has important implications for the stability of foreign exchange markets and  external price competitiveness. The importance of capital flows in determining exchange rate  movements has increased considerably, rendering some of the earlier guideposts of monetary policy  formulation possibly anachronistic (Mohan 2007 a). On a day-to-day basis, it is capital flows which  influence the exchange rate and interest rate arithmetic of the financial markets. Instead of the real  factors underlying trade competitiveness, it is expectations and reactions to news which drive capital  flows and exchange rates, often out of alignment with fundamentals. Capital flows have been observed  to cause overshooting of exchange rates as market participants act in concert while pricing information.  In the Indian case, notwithstanding the persistence of a large trade deficit, capital flows have led to  appreciation of the exchange rate, indicating the dominance of capital inflows in determining the  exchange rate movements (Chart 6).    The experience with capital flows has important lessons for the choice of the exchange rate  regime. The advocacy for corner solutions  a fixed peg without monetary policy independence or a  freely floating exchange rate retaining discretionary conduct of monetary policy  is distinctly on the  decline. The weight of experience seems to be tilting in favour of intermediate regimes with country- specific features, without targets for the level of the exchange rate and exchange market interventions  to fight extreme market turbulence. In general, emerging market economies have accumulated massive  foreign exchange reserves as a circuit breaker for situations where unidirectional expectations become  self-fulfilling (Mohan 2006).    In India, since a market-determined exchange rate system was set in place in March, 1993, the  exchange rate is largely determined by demand and supply conditions in the market. The exchange  rate policy in recent years has been guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring and  management of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a preannounced target or a  band, while allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions to determine the exchange rate  movements over a period in an orderly way. Subject to this predominant objective, the exchange rate  policy is guided by the need to reduce excess volatility, prevent the emergence of destabilising  speculative activities, maintain adequate level of reserves, and develop an orderly foreign exchange  market. The Indian foreign exchange market, like other developing countries markets, is not yet very  deep and broad, and can sometimes be characterised by uneven flow of demand and supply over  different periods. In this situation, the Reserve Bank of India has been prepared to make sales and  purchases of foreign currency in order to even out lumpy demand and supply in the relatively thin forex market and to smoothen jerky movements. However, such intervention is not governed by a  predetermined target or band around the exchange rate.     Over the years, transactions in the Indian foreign exchange market have experienced  tremendous growth. The increase in foreign exchange market turnover in India, between April 2004 and  April 2007 was the highest amongst the 54 countries covered in the Triennial Central Bank Survey of  Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity conducted by the Bank for International Settlements  in 2007. According to the survey, the daily average turnover in India jumped almost 5-fold from US $ 7  billion in April 2004 to US $ 34 billion in April 2007, whereas global turnover over the same period  increased by only 66 per cent from US $ 2.4 trillion to US $ 4.0 trillion. Reflecting these trends, the  share of India in global foreign exchange market turnover trebled from 0.3 per cent in April 2004 to 0.9  per cent in April 2007. The average daily turnover in Indian foreign exchange market has almost  doubled from US $ 25.8 billion in 2006-07 to US $ 48.0 billion in 2007-08 (Table 3). Component-wise,  the share of the spot market in total foreign exchange market turnover has declined marginally in the  recent years due to a pick-up in turnover in derivative segment. The merchant segment of the spot  market is generally dominated by the Government of India, select public sector units, such as Indian Oil  Corporation (IOC), and the FIIs. As the foreign exchange demand on account of public sector units and  FIIs tends to be lumpy and uneven, resultant demand-supply mismatches entail occasional pressures  on the foreign exchange market, warranting market interventions by the Reserve Bank to even out  lumpy demand and supply. However, as noted earlier, such intervention is not governed by a  predetermined target or band around the exchange rate.

Therefore, the liquidity and other related issues currently faced by these entities arising from the  unprecedented escalation in international crude prices have systemic implications for the smooth  functioning of financial markets and for overall financial stability in India. Accordingly, in order to  minimise the potential adverse consequences for financial markets, the Reserve Bank of India has  since end-May 2008 put in place Special Market Operations (SMO), under which, it (i) conducts open  market operations (outright or repo at the discretion of the Reserve Bank) in the secondary market  through designated banks in oil bonds held by public sector oil marketing companies in their own  accounts, currently subject to an overall ceiling of Rs.15 billion on any single day; and (ii) provides  equivalent foreign exchange through designated banks at market exchange rates to the oil companies.  The SMOs constitute only a fraction of the total turnover in the money and foreign exchange markets in  India but are intended to have the impact of reducing volatility. Further, the SMOs are likely to improve  the access of public sector oil companies to domestic liquidity and alleviate the lumpy demand in the  foreign exchange market in the current extraordinary situation.     Despite interventions by the Reserve Bank of India in the face of large capital flows, exchange  rate movement in India in the recent period is marked by significant bi-directional movement, implying  greater flexibility (Table 4). The IMF has observed in its Article IV Consultation Paper: since the start of  2007, the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) have experienced significant REER appreciation.  Most of the real appreciation in 2007 for India and Brazil came from nominal appreciation, whereas  China and Russia had inflation-led appreciation. Moreover, the volatility of the exchange rate of India  has become almost similar to the volatilities of exchange rates observed from the countries with  managed float exchange rate regime over the years.

Swings in capital flows can  have significant impact on exchange rates, domestic monetary and liquidity conditions and overall  macroeconomic and financial stability (Mohan 2007a). This has warranted appropriate monetary  operations to obviate wide fluctuations in market rates and ensure reasonable stability consistent with  the monetary policy stance. In fact, the Indian experience illustrates the tight link between external  sector management and domestic monetary management (Mohan 2006).    In India, with a view to neutralising the impact of excess forex flows on account of large capital  account surplus, the central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market in regular intervals.  But unsterilised forex market intervention can result in inflation, loss of competitiveness and attenuation  of monetary control. The loss of monetary control could be steep if such flows are large. Therefore, it is  essential that the monetary authorities take measures to offset the impact of such foreign exchange  market intervention, partly or wholly, so as to retain the intent of monetary policy through such intervention. Most techniques to offset the impact of forex inflows can be classified as either market  based or non-market based approaches. The market based approach involves financial transactions  between the central bank and the market, which leads to withdrawal or injection of liquidity, as the case  may be. The non-market based approach involves the use of quantitative barriers, rules or restrictions  in market activity, which attempt to keep the potential injection of liquidity outside the domestic financial  system. The market based approach aimed at neutralising part or whole of the monetary impact of  foreign inflows is termed as sterilisation.    In India, the liquidity impact of large capital inflows was traditionally managed mainly through the  repo and reverse repo auctions under the day-to-day Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). The LAF  operations were supplemented by outright open market operations (OMO), i.e. outright sales of the  government securities, to absorb liquidity on an enduring basis. In addition to LAF and OMO, excess  liquidity from the financial system was also absorbed through the building up of surplus balances of the  Government with the Reserve Bank, particularly by raising the notified amount of 91-day Treasury Bill  auctions, and forex swaps.    The market-based operations led to a progressive reduction in the quantum of securities with  the Reserve Bank. This apart, as per those operations, the usage of the entire stock of securities for  outright open market sales was constrained by the allocation of a part of the securities for day-to-day  LAF operations as well as for investments of surplus balances of the Central Government, besides  investments by the State Governments in respect of earmarked funds (CSF/GRF) while some of the  government securities were also in non-marketable lots. In the face of large capital flows coupled with  declining stock of government securities, the Reserve Bank of India introduced a new instrument of  sterilisation, viz., the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) to sustain market operations (Box I). Since its  introduction in April 2004, the MSS has served as a very useful instrument for medium term monetary  and liquidity management.  Box I : Introduction of MSS  In view of the finite stock of government securities available with the Reserve Bank for  sterilisation, particularly, as the option of issuing central bank securities is not permissible under  the RBI Act, the Working Group on Instruments of Sterilisation (2004) recommended that the  Central Government could issue a special variety of bills/bonds for sterilisation purposes. Unlike  in the case of central bank securities where the cost of sterilisation is borne indirectly by the fisc,  the cost of issuance of such instruments by the Government would be directly and transparently  borne by the fisc. The Committee recommended that to operationalise such a new instrument of  sterilisation and ensure fiscal transparency, the Central Government may consider setting up a  Market Stabilisation Fund (MSF) to be created in the Public Account. This Fund could issue new  instruments called Market Stabilisation Bills/Bonds (MSBs) for mopping up enduring surplus  liquidity from the system over and above the amount that could be absorbed under the day to  day repo operations of LAF.    Based on above recommendation, a new instrument named as the Market Stabilisation Scheme  (MSS) has been made operational from April 2004. Under this scheme, which is meant  exclusively for sterilization purposes, the Reserve Bank has been empowered to issue  Government Treasury Bills and medium duration dated securities for the purpose of liquidity  absorption. The scheme works by impounding the proceeds of auctions of Treasury bill and  Government securities in a separate identifiable MSS cash account maintained and operated by  the RBI. The amounts credited into the MSS cash Account are appropriated only for the purpose  of redemption and / or buy back of the Treasury Bills and / or dated securities issued under the  MSS. MSS securities are indistinguishable from normal Treasury Bills and Government dated  securities in the hands of the lender. The payments for interest and discount on MSS securities  are not made from the MSS Account, but shown in the Union budget and other related  documents transparently as distinct components under separate subheads. The introduction of  MSS has succeeded broadly in restoring LAF to its intended function of daily liquidity  management.    Since its introduction in April 2004, the MSS has served as a very useful instrument for medium  term monetary and liquidity management. It has been unwound at times of low capital flows and  built up when excess capital flows could lead to excess domestic liquidity (Mohan 2006).

In India, in addition to various market-based instruments of sterilization, such as, LAF, OMO,  MSS, balances of Government of India with the Reserve Bank, Forex swaps and private placements for  pre-payment of external loans, the RBI has also taken recourse to increasing the cash reserve ratio for  banks for withdrawing excess liquidity from the system. In recognition of the cumulative and lagged  effects of monetary policy, pre-emptive monetary tightening measures have also been put in effect  since September 2004 and continued during 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 in part, to manage  monetary effects of excess capital flows. Since September 2004, the repo rate and the reverse repo  rate have been increased by 250 and 150 basis points, respectively, while the cash reserve ratio (CRR)  has been raised by 400 basis points. In the context of large capital inflows and implications for liquidity  and monetary management, the interest rate ceilings on various non-resident deposit schemes have  been reduced by 75-100 basis points since January 2007 to discourage greater inflows in these  accounts.          Cost of Sterilisation    In the choice of instruments for sterilisation, it is important to recognise the benefits from and the  costs of sterilisation in general and the relative costs/benefits in the usage of a particular instrument.  The various instruments have differential impact on the balance sheets of the central bank, government  and the financial sector. For example, in the case of OMO sales, the differential between the yield on  government securities and return on foreign exchange assets is the cost to the Reserve Bank. Sales of  government securities under OMO also involve a transfer of market risks to the financial intermediaries,  mostly banks. The repo operations under LAF have a direct cost to the Reserve Bank. In the context of  an increase in CRR, the cost is borne by the banking sector if CRR balances are not remunerated.  However, if the CRR balances are remunerated, the cost could be shared between the banking sector  and the Reserve Bank. The extent of capital flows to be sterilised and the choice of instruments, thus,  also depend upon the impact on the balance sheets of these entities.   The cost of sterilisation in India is shared by the Central Government (the cost of MSS),  Reserve Bank (sterilization under LAF) and the banking system (in case of increase in the reserve  requirements). Since surpluses of the Reserve Bank are transferred to the Central Government, on a  combined balance sheet basis, the relative burdens of cost between the Government and Reserve  Bank are not of great relevance. However, the direct cost borne by the Government is transparently  shown in its budget accounts. Owing to the difference between international and Indian interest rates,  there is a positive cost of sterilisation but the cost has to be traded-off with the benefits associated with  market stability, export competitiveness and possible crisis avoidance in the external sector. Sterilized  interventions and interest rate policy are generally consistent with overall monetary policy stance that is  primarily framed on the basis of the domestic macro-economic outlook.          III.3 Capital Account Liberalisation  It is interesting to note that a number of empirical studies do not find evidence that greater  openness and higher capital flows lead to higher growth (eg. Prasad, Rajan and Subramanian, 2007).  These authors find that there is a positive correlation between current account balances and growth  among nonindustrial countries, implying that a reduced reliance on foreign capital is associated with  higher growth. Alternative specifications do not find any evidence of an increase in foreign capital  inflows directly boosting growth. The results could be attributed to the fact that even successful  developing countries have limited absorptive capacity for foreign resources, either because their  financial markets are underdeveloped, or because their economies are prone to overvaluation caused  by rapid capital inflows. Thus, a cautious approach to capital account liberalization would be useful for  macroeconomic and financial stability (Mohan 2008).    Henry (2007) argues that the empirical methodology of most of the existing studies is flawed  since these studies attempt to look for permanent effects of capital account liberalisation on growth,  whereas the theory posits only a temporary impact on the growth rate. Once such a distinction is  recognised, empirical evidence suggests that opening the capital account within a given country  consistently generates economically large and statistically significant effects, not only on economic  growth, but also on the cost of capital and investment. The beneficial impact is, however, dependent  upon the approach to the opening of the capital account, in particular, on the policies in regard to  liberalisation of debt and equity flows. Recent research demonstrates that liberalization of debt flows particularly short-term, dollar-denominated debt flowsmay cause problems. On the other hand, the  evidence indicates that countries derive substantial benefits from opening their equity markets to  foreign investors.   India has cautiously opened up its capital account since the early 1990s as the policy makers  realized that to meet the huge investment needs of the country domestic savings needs to be  supplemented with foreign savings. However, in liberalizing its capital account, India has adopted a  discriminatory approach towards various forms of capital flows. The Ministry of Finance, in its review of  the trends in receipts and expenditures at the end of the second quarter of the financial year 2007-08  mentioned that direct foreign investment is the most preferred form of foreign capital flow. Investments  in Indian firms through the stock market and by venture capital firms in unlisted companies are also  potentially beneficial. External commercial borrowings and other short term flows are areas where one  can introduce an element of control to moderate sudden surges. Accordingly, the thrust of policy reform  in India was in favour of a compositional shift in capital flows away from debt to non-debt creating flows,  viz., FDI and foreign portfolio investment; strict regulation of external commercial borrowings, especially  short term debt; discouraging volatile element of flows from non-resident Indians; and gradual  liberalization of outflows. The present status of the various policy measures taken in India to manage  the capital account is given at Annex 1A and 1B.    India has followed a gradualist approach to liberalization of its capital account. The status of  capital account convertibility in India for various non-residents is as follows: for foreign corporate and  foreign institutions, there is a reasonable amount of convertibility; for non-resident Indians (NRIs) there  is approximately an equal amount of convertibility, but one accompanied by some procedural and  regulatory impediments. For non-resident individuals other than NRIs there is near-zero convertibility.  Movement towards fuller capital account convertibility (FCAC) implies that all non-residents (corporate  and individuals) should be treated equally. As mentioned earlier, recognising the merits in moving  towards fuller capital account convertibility, the Reserve Bank of India in consulation with the  Government of India, appointed the Committee on Fuller Capital Account Convertibility in March 2006.  The Committee has set out the conditions that would be concomitant to move towards fuller capital  account convertibility. The Committee has made several recommendations on the development of  financial markets in addition to addressing issues related to interaction of monetary policy and  exchange rate management, regulation/supervision of banks and the timing and sequencing of capital  account liberalization measures. Measures towards fuller capital account convertibility as  recommended by the Committee are provided at Annex 2.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank of India has implemented a number of measures, e.g.,  enhancement of limit of the remittance, liberalization of Exchange Earners' Foreign Currency Accounts,  liberalization of procedures for project and service exports, enhancement of banks' overseas  borrowings, increase in access of ECBs, establishment of corporate offices abroad, enhancement of  FIIs' investment in Government Securities, enhancement of ceiling on Mutual Funds overseas  investment, and liberalization of forward contract regulations, etc based on the recommendations made  by the Committee.      In view of the large capital flows during the last few years, recently, the Government of India and  the Reserve Bank have taken some additional capital account measures aimed at limiting the  implications of forex flows for the conduct of domestic monetary policy. In February 2003, the  Government pre-paid a part of its high cost external debt amounting to US $ 3.03 billion to the Asian  Development Bank and the World Bank by privately placing marketable securities with the Reserve  Bank. This apart, relaxations were effected in regard to outflows, both under the current and capital  accounts (Box II). At the same time measures were taken to manage debt inflows, especially ECB and  NRI deposits.     Box II: Recent Measures Towards Liberalization of Capital Outflows from India   Investment in overseas Joint Ventures (JV) / Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) by  Indian companies have been permitted up to 400 per cent of the net worth of the  Indian company under the Automatic Route.   Indian companies have been allowed to invest in energy and natural resources  sectors such as oil, gas, coal and mineral ores in excess of the current limits with the  prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India.   Listed Indian companies have been allowed for portfolio investment abroad up to 50  per cent of the net worth from the earlier limit of 35 per cent of the net worth.   The earlier limit for prepayment of External Commercial borrowings (ECBs) without  the Reserve Bank approval have been increased from USD 400 million to USD 500  million, subject to compliance with the minimum average maturity period as  applicable to the loan.   The aggregate ceiling for overseas investments by mutual funds registered with  SEBI has been increased from USD 5 billion to USD 7 billion.   The earlier limit under Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) has been enhanced  from USD 100,000 to USD 200,000 per financial year. In addition, changes in policies are made from time to time to modulate the debt-creating capital  flows depending on the financing needs of the corporate sector and vulnerability of the domestic  economy to external shocks. Recently, to facilitate easy access of Indian corporates to foreign funds, the  Reserve Bank of India has increased the limit on ECBs for Rupee expenditure for permissible end-uses  under the Approval Route to US $ 100 million for borrowers in infrastructure sector and to US $ 50  million for other borrowers from earlier limit of US $ 20 million per financial year, with effect from May 29,  2008. The all-in-cost interest rate ceiling for ECBs and trade credits for imports into India have been  raised upwards. Effective from June 2, 2008, entities in the services sector, viz. hotels, hospitals and  software companies, are allowed to avail ECB up to US $ 100 million, per financial year, for the purpose  of import of capital goods under the Approval Route. The limits for investment of the FIIs in the Indian  debt market have been revised upwards from US $ 4.7 billion (US $ 3.2 billion in G-secs and US $ 1.5  billion in corporate bonds) to US $ 8.0 billion (US $ 5.0 billion in G-secs and US $ 3.0 billion in corporate  bonds).  IV. Issues and Challenges  The management of capital flows is a complex process encompassing a spectrum of policy  choices, which inter alia include: the appropriate level of reserves, monetary policy objectives related to  liquidity management and maintenance of healthy financial market conditions with financial stability.  The intensified pressures due to large and volatile capital flows in the recent period in an atmosphere of  global uncertainties make the task significantly complex and critical (Reddy 2008b). Indias Finance  Minister while referring to Managing Capital Flows in the Mid-Year Review of 2007-08, dated  December 7, 2007 stated that: While there are international experiences in this regard with some  successful and painful adjustment process, the specific Indian context requires innovative policy  responses. Going forward, this would be a major challenge.    In view of the above, some of the major issues as well as emerging challenges in respect of  management of capital flows to India include the following:     In the face of large and volatile capital flows, the problem for monetary management is two-fold.  First, it had to distinguish implicitly between durable flows and transient flows. If capital flows are  deemed to be durable and indefinite, questions arise regarding foreign exchange management. If  the flows are deemed to be semi-durable, essentially reflecting the business cycle, the task of  monetary and liquidity management is to smoothen out their impact on the domestic economy,  finding means to absorb liquidity in times of surplus and to inject it in times of deficit. Second, in the  short term, daily, weekly or monthly volatility in flows needs to be smoothened to minimise the effect  on domestic overnight interest rates. In practice, ex-ante, it is difficult to distinguish what is durable,  what is semi-durable and what is transient. Hence policy and practice effectively operates in an  environment of uncertainty and a variety of instruments have to be used to manage liquidity in this  fluid scenario.     The challenges for monetary policy with an open capital account get exacerbated if domestic  inflation firms up. In the event of demand pressures building up, increases in interest rates might be  advocated to sustain growth in a non-inflationary manner but such action increases the possibility of  further capital inflows if a significant part of these flows is interest sensitive and explicit policies to  moderate flows are not undertaken. These flows could potentially reduce the efficacy of monetary  policy tightening by enhancing liquidity. Such dilemmas complicate the conduct of monetary policy  in India if inflation exceeds the indicative projections. During 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 so far,  as domestic interest rates in India hardened on the back of withdrawal of monetary accommodation,  external foreign currency borrowings by domestic corporates witnessed a significant jump in India,  leading to even higher flows. In case, there are no restrictions on overseas borrowings by banks  and financial institutions, such entities could also annul the efforts of domestic monetary tightening.      As far as the exchange rate is concerned, the large inflow of remittances and major and sustained  growth in software exports coupled with capital inflows have the potential for possible overvaluation  of the currency and the resultant erosion of long-term competitiveness of other traditional and  goods sectors  a problem popularly known as the Dutch disease. Given the fact that more people  are in the goods sector, the human aspects of the exchange rate management should not be lost  sight of. The Dutch Disease syndrome has so far been managed by way of reserves build-up and  sterilisation, the former preventing excessive nominal appreciation and the latter preventing higher  inflation. However, the issue remains how long and to what extent such an exchange rate  management strategy would work given the fact that we are faced with large and continuing capital  flows apart from strengthening current receipts on account of remittances and software exports.  This issue has assumed increased importance over the last year with increased capital flows arising  from the higher sustained growth performance of the economy and significant enhancement of  international confidence in the Indian economy (Mohan 2007 a).     A related issue is whether there should be sterilised intervention and if so, the timing and quantum  of such interventions. There is usually a cost attached to sterilisation operations. At the same time,  it is also necessary to assess the indirect cost of not sterilising if there are signs of a Dutch disease  caused by flows in the capital account. Most often, it is not a question of whether to sterilise or not,  but how much to sterilise. That is an important issue of judgment that needs to be made in  conjunction with domestic monetary and liquidity conditions.    Even when capital flows are sterilised through open market operations the costs could be large  when sterilisation operations raise domestic interest rates and result in the trap of even greater  capital flows. The fiscal impact of sterilisation also requires to be factored in, specially when a large  stock of securities is required to be issued for the purpose.     Another issue relates to the choice and an appropriate mix of instruments for sterilisation. Each  instrument, namely, MSS, LAF and CRR has different features and interactions. Utilisation of each  of these will also depend on what is the permanency of the components of the flows and how they  should be sterilised in the aggregate. Further, each instrument can be used in different ways. The  LAF is able to take care of very short period flows. The MSS handles the longer term flows slightly  better than the LAF, and the CRR is more appropriate for addressing fairly longer term flows.  However, effectiveness of the MSS will depend more on the initiatives of the market participants  than on the decisions of the Reserve Bank. Operationally, the issue is often not which instrument  but how much of each instrument needs to be utilised, with due regard to the capital flows, market  conditions, and monetary as well as credit developments.      While interventions are carried out with the objective of containing volatility in the forex market,  intervention over a long period, especially when the exchange rate is moving in one direction, could  make interventions less effective. However, a critical question is what would be the impact on  expectations about future movements in forex markets if no intervention takes place. The  challenges of intervention and management of expectations will be particularly daunting when  financial contagion occurs, since such events are characterised by suddenness, high speed and  large magnitudes of unexpected flows, in either direction. The quintessence for a relevant monetary  policy is the speed of adjustment of the policy measures to rapidly changing situations.     A further challenge for policy in the context of fuller capital account openness will be to preserve the  financial stability of the system as greater deregulation is done on capital outflows and on debt  inflows. This will require market development, enhancement of regulatory capacity in these areas,  as well as human resource development in both financial intermediaries and non-financial entities.     Another aspect of greater capital market openness concerns the presence of foreign banks in India.  With fuller capital account convertibility and greater presence of foreign banks over time, a number  of issues will arise. First, if these large global banks have emerged as a result of real economies of  scale and scope, how will smaller national banks compete in countries like India, and will they  themselves need to generate a larger international presence? Second, there is considerable  discussion today on overlaps and potential conflicts between home country regulators of foreign  banks and host country regulators: how will these be addressed and resolved in the years to come?  Third, given that operations in one country such as India are typically small relative to the global  operations of these large banks, the attention of top management devoted to any particular country  is typically low. Consequently, any market or regulatory transgressions committed in one country by  such a bank, which may have a significant impact on banking or financial market of that country, is  likely to have negligible impact on the bank's global operations. It has been seen in recent years  that even relatively strong regulatory action taken by regulators against such global banks has had  negligible market or reputational impact on them in terms of their stock price or similar metrics.  Thus, there is loss of regulatory effectiveness as a result of the presence of such financial  conglomerates. Hence, there is inevitable tension between the benefits that such global  conglomerates bring and some regulatory and market structure and competition issues that may  arise.   V. Outlook  Recent global developments have considerably heightened the uncertainty surrounding the  outlook on capital flows to India, complicating the conduct of monetary and liquidity management. In  view of the strong fundamentals of the economy and massive injections of liquidity by central banks in  advanced economies, there could be sustained inflows, as in the recent past. If the pressures intensify,  it may necessitate stepped up operations in terms of capital account management and more active  liquidity management with all instruments at the command of the Reserve Bank. At the same time, it is  necessary in the context of recent global events not to exclude the possibility of reversals of capital  flows due to any abrupt changes in sentiments or global liquidity conditions. In this scenario, it is  important to be ready to deal with potentially large and volatile outflows along with spillovers. In this  context, there is headroom with the Reserve Bank to deal with both scenarios in terms of the flexibility  in the deployment of instruments such as the MSS, the CRR, the SLR and the LAF for active liquidity  management in both directions, complemented by prudential regulations and instruments for capital  account management.

Annex 2    Measures Towards Fuller Capital Account Convertibility  Recommendations by Tarapore Committee (2006)    (i) The Committee recommends that the overall ECB ceiling as also the ceiling for automatic approval  should be gradually raised. Rupee denominated ECB (payable in foreign currency) should be outside the  ECB ceiling.     (ii) The Committee has concerns about the volume of trade credit as there could be sudden changes in the  availability of such credit.  Furthermore, there are concerns as to whether the trade credit numbers are fully  captured in the data even while noting that suppliers credit of less than 180 days are excluded from these  data. Import-linked short-term loans should be monitored in a comprehensive manner. The per transaction  limit of US$ 20 million should be reviewed and the scheme revamped to avoid unlimited borrowing.    (iii) Recognising that Indian industry is successfully building up its presence abroad, there is a strong case  for liberalising the present limits for corporate investment abroad. The Committee recommends that the  limits for such outflows should be raised in phases from 200 per cent of net worth to 400 per cent of net  worth. Furthermore, for non-corporate businesses, it is recommended that the limits should be aligned with  those for corporates.    (iv) EEFC Account holders should be provided foreign currency current/savings accounts with cheque  writing facility and interest bearing term deposits.    (v) Project exports should be provided greater flexibility and these facilities should be also provided for  service exports.    (vi) FIIs should be prohibited from investing fresh money raised through PNs. Existing PN-holders may be  provided an exit route and phased out completely within one year.     (vii) The Committee recommends that non-resident corporates should be allowed to invest in the Indian  stock markets through SEBI-registered entities including mutual funds and Portfolio Management Schemes  who will be individually responsible for fulfilling Know your Customer (KYC) and Financial Action Task  Force (FATF) norms. The money should come through bank accounts in India.    (viii) At present, only multilateral institutions are allowed to raise rupee bonds in India.  To encourage,  selectively, the raising of rupee denominated bonds, the Committee recommends that other  institutions/corporates should be allowed to raise rupee bonds (with an option to convert into foreign  exchange) subject to an overall ceiling which should be gradually raised.      (ix) The banks borrowing facilities are at present restrictive though there are various special facilities which  are outside the ceiling. The Committee recommends that the limits for borrowing overseas should be linked  to paid-up capital and free reserves, and not to unimpaired Tier I capital, as at present, and raised  gradually to 100 per cent by 2010-11. Ultimately, all types of external liabilities of banks should be within an  overall limit.   (x) At present, only mutual funds are permitted to invest overseas subject to stipulations for each fund. The  Committee recommends that the various stipulations on individual fund limits and the proportion in relation  to NAV should be abolished. The overall ceilings should be raised from the present level of US$ 2 billion to  US$ 3 billion in Phase I (2006-07), to US$ 4 billion in Phase II (by 2008-09) and to US$ 5 billion in Phase III  (by 2010-11). The Committee further recommends that these facilities should be available, apart from  Mutual Funds, to SEBI registered portfolio management schemes.    (xi) The present facility for individuals to freely remit US$ 25,000 per calendar year enables individuals to  open foreign currency accounts overseas. The Committee recommends that this annual limit be  successively raised to US$ 50,000 in Phase I, US$ 100,000 in Phase II and US$ 200,000 in Phase III.  Difficulties in operating this scheme should be reviewed.  Since this facility straddles the current and capital  accounts, the Committee recommends that where current account transactions are restricted, i.e., gifts,  donations and travel, these should be raised to an overall ceiling of US$ 25,000 without any sub-limit.     (xii) At present only NRIs are allowed to maintain FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits. The Committee  recommends that non-residents (other than NRIs) should also be allowed access to these deposit  schemes. Since NRIs enjoy tax concessions on FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits, it would be necessary to  provide FCNR(B)/NR(E)RA deposit facilities as separate and distinct schemes for non-residents (other  than NRIs) without tax benefits. In Phase I, the NRs (other than NRIs) could be first provided the FCNR(B)  deposit facility, without tax benefits, subject to KYC/FATF norms. In Phase II, the NR(E)RA deposit  scheme, with cheque writing facility, could be provided to NRs (other than NRIs) without tax benefits after  the system has in place KYC/FATF norms. The present tax regulations on FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA  deposits for NRIs should be reviewed by the government.     (xiii) At present, only NRIs are allowed to invest in companies on the Indian stock exchanges subject to  certain stipulations. The Committee recommends that all individual non-residents should be allowed to  invest in the Indian stock market through SEBI registered entities including mutual funds and Portfolio  Management Schemes who will be responsible for meeting KYC and FATF norms and that the money  should come through bank accounts in India.
