Role of Accountants in Fostering Economic Growth1Y. V. ReddyDistinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,I am thankful to Shri Kamlesh Vikamsey for inviting me to this augustgathering. This Conference is of relevance to all of us, not only because of theeminence of the speakers who are addressing this gathering, but also becauseit represents an important step by the Institute of Chartered Accountants ofIndia (ICAI) to distill from the experiences of other countries in its quest forglobal benchmarking of our accounting standards. The agenda for theConference is comprehensive while focusing on critical but contemporaryissues. I congratulate the organisers for ensuring a professionally stimulatingfeast.  In my address today, I will confine myself to a few general observations.Broadly speaking, from the micro-economic point of view, accountingstandards encompass mechanisms for providing information about the financialcondition and performance and importantly, the risk profile of firms to allpotential users. It therefore, constitutes one of the core elements of thefinancial infrastructure.  From the macro-economic point of view, theinformation supplied serves a dual function. First, by facilitating theidentification of most productive use of economic resources, it constitutes thebasis for assessment of prospective rewards and risks. Second, it acts as anenabling mechanism for control over the effective utilisation of resources.Taken together, this forms the basis of income allocation among variousconstituents and the exercise of financial discipline.It is not appropriate to believe that the ‘invisible hand’ of the marketwould generate the requisite information, irrespective of the accountingstandards in place. This argument of the presumed omniscience of marketstends to disregard the fact that producing information can be costly. Moreimportantly, the costs of generating information are private, while the benefitsare dispersed across all potential users, resulting in a tendency to under-supply. This under provision of information, as you would all know, was a key                                                1Inaugural Address delivered by Dr. Y V Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at theInternational Conference on Role of Accountancy Profession in Anchoring Economic Growth,organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, on January 19, 2006 at Mumbai.factor behind the build-up of financial imbalances and contributed to theenormity of the Asian crisis.  In fact it is the Asian crisis that brought into clearfocus the close links between micro and macro aspects of economic growth aswell as institutional aspects as distinct from policy aspects of economicmanagement.Effective market mechanisms must, therefore, be instituted to ensureefficient capital mobilisation and its prudent allocation in securing long-termeconomic growth with assured stability. Needless to say, the development ofefficient markets needs to be supported by high-quality market participants.Intermediaries, issuers, investors, regulators and professionals play importantroles in generating this growth dynamism in our financial markets. Within thecontext of both domestic and international challenges, the accountingprofession therefore plays an important complementary role towards building acredible, reputable and internationally competitive economy, irrespective of thecapacities in which they perform. This includes not only in your capacity asauditors, but also as advisors, consultants, directors or even as members of thecorporate sector.In auditing financial statements, accountants have the most intricateknowledge of the financials of companies. They are able to ascertain thedrivers of performance and are equipped to provide an independent andobjective evaluation on the opportunities and risk profiles of firms. Thus, forinstance, in the absence of accurate financial reporting, it would becomedifficult for banks to make informed decisions about credit allocation unlessthey have confidence in the information provided by financial reporting. It is thequality, reliability and objectivity of this information which stakeholders relyupon to make informed judgment and allocate resources efficiently.Transparency is imperative to imbue confidence amongst investors inour markets. The quality of information and the integrity of the market place actas strong modes for brand differentiation. While the quality of information hasimmediate and far-reaching implications for a particular enterprise, it eventuallypermeates to the market and the economy as a whole. It is, therefore, notsurprising to find that the accounting profession is being constantly challengedto meet the demands for quality information. As key providers and verifiers ofinformation, the bottom-line is simple: the higher the quality and integritymaintained by the profession, the stronger and more resilient will our marketsbe.The investing public in India is at present broader and much morediscerning than earlier. A crisis  behind closed doors in past decades oftenbecomes a matter of the broadest public concern at present. The globallynoticed accounting irregularities at leading corporate entities in recent yearshave provided graphic evidence as to how much the absence of accurate,timely and comparable financial information can impede the effective working ofmarkets. More generally, the debilitating effects of deficiencies in financialreporting have been amply demonstrated by the spate of financial crises andscandals in recent years.  Thus, the importance of integrity of auditing functionsfor maintaining financial stability is now well-recognised.  Professions such asyours could possibly take the lead in self-policing. The mix between self-regulation and regulatory discipline need not be watertight, but instead beflexible to inspire high levels of professionalism and integrity so as to ensureincreased transparency and greater accountability.  By providing the foundationfor compilation of credible financial statements, the accounting professionfacilitates market discipline, engenders confidence among various stakeholdersand reduces the possibility of misleading information that can disrupt stability offinancial systems.In respect of banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shares asynergistic relationship with accounting profession. The RBI conducts both on-site inspections of banks as well as technology-driven off-site surveillance ofbanks to ensure compliance with the prescribed guidelines. In addition, the RBIrelies on accountants to ensure compliance with financial reportingrequirements. In the course of monitoring compliance with the prudentialregulations, the RBI identifies and requires corrections for departures fromestablished accounting standards. It also pursues the auditors’ qualified opinionwith the banks and their auditors. This serves to provide the RBI with valuableinsights on the inhibitors of performance, which can be utilised to advise bankson corrective measures.Some time ago, a Working Group was constituted by the RBI, chaired byShri N.D.Gupta, a former President of the ICAI, to identify banks’ compliancewith Indian Accounting Standards and recommended steps to eliminate orreduce any deviations from them. Based on the recommendations of theGroup, guidelines were issued in March 2003 on certain accounting standards.Subsequently, detailed guidelines were issued to ensure banks’ compliancewith these standards in April 2004. These improvements will further align ouraccounting practices with those prevailing internationally. I would like tohighlight in this context the emerging importance of the accounting professionin view of the impending implementation of Basel-II framework for capitaladequacy.With the opening up of the Indian economy, firms are sourcing financefrom abroad through both the debt and equity routes, as also acquiring stakesabroad. The issue of adopting best practices in accounting, tailored to country-specific requirements, has acquired added importance and priority in thiscontext. This demand for greater transparency and more effective financialreporting has placed renewed pressures on those preparing and attestingfinancial reports to comply with the accepted accounting standards, and alsoensure that these standards are properly applied.  Since some of the softwarecompanies and a few manufacturing corporates from India are now ratedglobally best, RBI intends to be similarly the best.  Needless to say we expectIndian accounting profession to be among the world's best, if it is not already soin any specific aspect.Many of you would be aware that RBI has been making pro-activeefforts to facilitate positioning of international financial standards and codes inrelevant areas of the financial system in India. As part of this process and toguide the overall process of implementation of appropriate changes in respectto various segments of the financial system, the RBI had, in consultation withGovernment of India, constituted a Standing Committee on InternationalFinancial Standards and Codes in December 1999. The Standing Committee,in turn, constituted Advisory Groups in ten core subject areas pertaining to thefinancial system, broadly encompassing the key areas prescribed by FinancialStability Forum. Out of these, the Advisory Group on Accounting and Auditing(Chairman: Shri Y.H.Malegam) compared the Indian standards and relevantstatutes with international standards and made recommendations for reducingthe gap.In this regard, it is heartening to observe that the accounting andauditing standards in India are being increasingly benchmarked againstinternational standards. I am also happy to note that the ICAI is makingsustained efforts to align the Indian accounting standards with the internationalones. A Review of the recommendations of the Advisory Group by the ReserveBank in December 2004 shows that the gap between International AccountingStandards and Indian Accounting Standards has been gradually narrowing,reflecting the foresight of the profession in recognising the importance ofinternational comparability.As my remarks would testify, the relationship between the RBI and theICAI has been mutually reinforcing, where both can draw on each other’sstrengths and contribute to an efficient and stable financial system. I am happyto state that we have decided to constitute a small group comprising therepresentatives of the RBI and the ICAI who can meet at regular intervals andsort out pending issues relating to standardisation of audit formats, concurrentaudit of banks and empanelment of auditors as well as implementation issue oncertain accounting standards.Before concluding, let me say a few words on the role of auditors ineconomic reforms.  While the reform process had largely emphasised the needfor improving the balance sheets, it is very critical that these measures reallyget reflected in the financial statements and present a true and fair view of thefinancial position of all entities.  The reform process would be evidentlyincomplete if the balance sheet integrity is not ensured.Though it is generally thought that the primary responsibility of theauditor fraternity is towards the shareholders of the entity, I believe that in thefinancial sector in a liberalised environment, their role is much wider. Forexample, they owe perhaps greater responsibility to all the varied stakeholdersof banks, viz., depositors, regulators, banking community within the country asalso the banking community outside the domestic market who have toundertake banking/ correspondent relationships with the domestic bankingsystem,; that is, in effect the entire system - domestic and global.  As you arewell aware, the audit of a banking entity is special relative to the audit of acorporate since banks are universally considered to be special.  In the case ofa corporate audit, the stakeholders are primarily the shareholders and in caseof a crisis, the fall-out would be by and large localised to the corporate entityconcerned.  In the case of a banking entity, the systemic impact of any crisismay not remain localised to the banking entity but could under certaincircumstances translate into a systemic issue with far greater consequences.  Itwould be appropriate to conclude that perhaps a critical link in the successfulimplementation of the financial reform process lies with the auditors of bankswhen they ensure that the financial statements of banks reflect the highest levelof integrity.I am sure that the deliberations over the next few days will provide usefulinsights which could be fruitfully explored to the benefit of all concerned.We too look forward to benefiting from your deliberations.I wish the Conference all success.Thank you.
