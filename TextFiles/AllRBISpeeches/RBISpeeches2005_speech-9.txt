Implications of Global Financial Imbalances1for the Emerging Market EconomiesI am thankful to the Banque de France for inviting me to the internationalsymposium on Productivity, Competitiveness and Globalisation to enable me toshare my thoughts on financial stability. I intend speaking on the possibleimplications of global imbalances for the emerging market economies (EMEs)with special focus on India.Although fast growing economies are generally grouped together as2EMEs , some of their major macroeconomic indicators present a wide spectrum.While some of the EMEs are running large current account surpluses (such asChina, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Venezuela, Malaysia, Taiwan andBrazil), some others are running current account deficits (such as Turkey,Hungary, South Africa, Mexico, India and the Czech Republic) and their currentaccount balances range from a deficit of US$ 20 billion to a surplus of US $ 69billion. While savings rates for select EMEs range from nine per cent to 43 percent of the GDP, in most of the EMEs the rates have increased and overtakenthose of the industrial countries, with particularly high savings rates in China,Malaysia and Russia.  Likewise, while some of the EMEs have fiscal surplus(Russia), several others have fiscal deficit (Turkey, India, the Philippines,Argentina and several other EMEs).  Also, while some of the EMEs such as Indiaare largely domestic-demand driven, some other EMEs, particularly in the EastAsia (Malaysia and the Philippines) are largely dependent on exports to sustaintheir growth and their exports of goods and services range from 15 per cent toover 120 per cent of GDP.   It is useful to note that while some of the EMEs arenet oil exporters, some others are net oil importers.Thus, given the diverse nature, macroeconomic conditions and policyregimes of the EMEs, it may be difficult to treat all of them as contributing to                                                          1 Remarks by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the round table discussion atthe International Symposium organized by the Banque de France on November 4, 2005 at Paris.2 There is no single acceptable definition of EMEs, although they are commonly referred to aseconomies with high growth prospects. The IMF in its latest Global Financial Stability Report hascategorised the following countries as EMEs: Latin America – Argentina, Brazil, Chile Colombia,Mexico, Peru, Venezuela; Asia – China, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, thePhilippines, Taiwan Province of China and Thailand; Europe, Middle East and Africa – CzechRepublic, Egypt, Hungary, Israel, Jordon, Morocco, Poland, Russia, South Africa and Turkey.Select economic indicators of select EMEs are furnished in the Annex.global financial imbalances, in the same manner, nor would all the EMEsbe identically affected by the adjustment of global financial imbalances. It may,therefore, be somewhat difficult to speak about the implications of global financialimbalances for the EMEs as a group.  I would, therefore, focus primarily on India,but the analytic framework could perhaps be of some help in appreciating theimplications for different EMEs.It is worthwhile to mention that there are some factors which couldadversely impact the EMEs as a group, though with varying intensity. Globaldevelopments, particularly those in the world financial markets, have the mostdirect and serious impact on the financing conditions in the emerging markets.An abrupt and sharp adjustment of the currencies may potentially lead to asignificant portfolio rebalancing by the foreign investors, which could cause sharpchanges in the long-term yields.  This, in turn, could result in volatility in the leveland cost of capital flows with direct implications for the EMEs.Volatility in financial markets could adversely affect the EMEs in manyways, and also in a complex and interrelated fashion. For convenience ofanalysis, the impact may be classified broadly into: (i) the impact on the financingconditions in which EMEs operate; (ii) impairment of the balance sheets of thebanking sector, and (iii) hampering of the growth prospects in the real sector.Even within the same EMEs, the impact could vary across different entities suchas the Government, the corporate sector, the households and the financialsector, depending upon the country-specific and institution-specific operatingenvironment, the stage of development and the degree of integration with andexposure to the international financial markets. In view of the diversity of theEMEs and the complexity of impact of any unpredictable unwinding of globalimbalances, it is proposed to analyse the possible implications, illustratively, withreference to IndiaRecent Macroeconomic Developments in IndiaThere are several noteworthy features of India’s recentmacroeconomic performance. First, the investment climate has improved andindustrial and service sector activity has picked up. Second, buoyant exportshave emerged as the driver of demand for a broad spectrum of industries. Third,there has been a modest attempt at and a commitment to achieve fiscalconsolidation.  Fourth, the trend inflation has declined over the years and inflationexpectations stabilised. Fifth, India has been successful in managing liquidityagainst the backdrop of continuing capital flows. Sixth, India has emerged as apreferred destination for foreign investors and received about a quarter of theglobal portfolio flows to the EMEs in 2004. Seventh, India’s foreign exchangereserves are in excess of the total outstanding external debt of the country.Eighth, the performance of the corporate sector has improved and somecorporates are now listed on the international stock exchanges. Ninth, India’sfinancial markets have deepened, widened and become vibrant over the yearswith a robust institutional framework and market infrastructure in place. Tenth,the profitability and soundness indicators of the banking sector have improved.Finally, India has been adopting international benchmarks for financial standardsand best practices with suitable adaptations for Indian conditions.The Indian economy today is characterised by an environment ofconfidence, positive business expectations, a renewal of rule-based fiscalconsolidation, stable and orderly financial markets and institutions andprogressive integration with the global economy. Real GDP growth for 2005-06(April-March) has been conservatively projected at around 7.0 per cent, andmore recently, revised upwards to a range of 7.0 to 7.5 per cent. Despite thesustained strength of export performance, the merchandise trade deficit isexpected to be somewhat higher in 2005-06 than in the previous year, mainly onaccount of substantially higher oil prices and non-oil import demand forinvestment. For the year as a whole, while invisibles may finance a large part ofthe enlarged trade deficit, the current account deficit is expected to widen during2005-06 but to remain within acceptable limits that can be financed by normalcapital flows. The headline inflation is expected to lie in the range of 5.0-5.5 percent. Consolidation of Central Government finances is the goal of fiscal policy atthe Centre – the targets are: the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of 3.0 per cent of GDPand the elimination of the revenue deficit by 2008-09. The fiscal position of StateGovernments also continues to undergo slight correction in terms of key deficitindicators.Against this background, it may be useful to analyse the implications ofglobal financial imbalances for India in terms of the likely impact on four separatebalance sheets - of the government, of the Reserve Bank of India, of thecorporate sector and of the banking sector.Impact on the GovernmentThe Government of India does not raise resources from the internationalcapital markets to finance the fiscal deficit, though the bilateral and multilateralsources do provide moderate amount of foreign currency funds.  TheGovernment could, therefore, be affected indirectly through the spill-over impactof external developments on domestic interest rates. What is of relevance, interalia, is the nominal international interest rates and domestic interest rates,adjusted for inflation differential.  To the extent there is a rise in domestic interestrates, there could be an increase in the cost of government borrowings of theGovernment. Since most of the outstanding debt is at fixed rates and not onfloating rates, the rise in the borrowing cost will be incremental. This situationalso provides greater headroom for a flexible monetary policy to adjust policyrates, as and when warranted, without any excessive impact on the fiscal deficit.Impact on the Reserve Bank's Balance SheetThe fiscal position of the Government could also be indirectly impactedthrough the nature of management of foreign exchange reserves held by theReserve Bank. Volatility in the foreign exchange market exposes foreignexchange reserves to both operational and market risks. Depreciation in thevalue of any reserve currency vis-à-vis the domestic currency would result in anequivalent decline in the value of the reserves held, though the impact may bemitigated to some extent through appreciation of other currencies in whichforeign exchange reserves are held. Also, increase in global interest rates wouldentail capital losses on the corresponding assets, including fixed incomesecurities.  Valuation and capital losses could impact the income of the ReserveBank of India and thus, its surplus transferable to the Government which, in turn,would have fiscal implications. It is pertinent to mention that the Reserve Bank ofIndia, as a matter of prudent practice, follows conservative accounting normswhereby the valuation gains/losses on foreign exchange reserves and gold arenot taken to the profit and loss account, but instead, booked under a separatereserve head.Impact on the Indian CorporatesAs a result of deterioration in global financial market conditions, spreadson corporate debt might widen suddenly due to shift in investor confidence in theglobal financial markets. Increase in the global interest rates may also haveimpact on other benchmarks such as LIBOR. A sharp rise in yields may entail anincrease in cost of variable-rate debt contracted by the corporates. This, to someextent, could be offset if there is a depreciation of the relevant currency andconsequent decline in the value of the existing debt contracted by corporates inthat currency.Indian corporates as also some of the public sector enterprises raiseresources from the international capital markets. While a part of their externalcommercial borrowings is at variable interest rate, a part is at fixed interest rates.In order to avoid any serious impact of changes in the exchange rate on thebalance sheet of the corporate sector, Reserve Bank has been advising banks toregularly monitor the unhedged position of the corporates and has also beenexhorting corporates to hedge their foreign exchange exposures. Thus, India'scorporates could be affected by the deterioration in the financing conditions onlyto the extent they are not hedged either by foreign-currency cash flows in thenormal course of business or through recourse to appropriate hedging products.Corporates would, however, be affected to the extent interest rates firm up in thedomestic market, depending on their exposure to debt relative to other liabilities.Impact on the Banking SectorBanks in India are dependent mainly on domestic deposits, predominantlyat fixed rates, for their resource requirements. They would, therefore, beimpacted significantly only if the  adverse developments in the internationalcapital markets are particularly severe.  Banks, in general, also do not hold stockof securities in foreign currency. Banks in India have, thus, relatively smallexposure to the foreign exchange market. Their foreign currency borrowings aresubject to the prudential limit of 25 per cent of their Tier-I capital and they arealso required to maintain capital against the net open position. Foreign currencyborrowings by the banks are permitted beyond this ceiling, which is linked to thenet worth, exclusively for the purpose of export finance.Like many other emerging market economies, credit extended by banks inIndia has increased sharply in recent times. Credit growth, which was earlierseen largely in housing and retail loans, has now turned quite broad-based withagriculture and industry also joining to drive up the credit demand.  The creditgrowth in some sectors, specially those related to assets which are experiencingprice volatilities, is being monitored closely.Banks are allowed to lend to resident exporters in foreign currency atinternationally competitive rates of interest from their foreign currency lines ofcredit as well as out of funds available in exchange earners' foreign currencyaccounts, resident foreign currency accounts and foreign currency non-resident(banks) accounts. These loans are intended to finance domestic and importedinputs for export production. Foreign currency loans to exporters are generallyhedged against credit risk since they are extended for bona fide underlyingactivity viz., export production. They are also usually covered for exchange risksince they are denominated in foreign currency. Banks are also allowed toextend loans in foreign currency to non-resident Indians against their FCNRBdeposits. Funds in foreign currency deposits can also be utilized for lending todomestic corporates for working capital requirements in India, import financing,purchase of indigenous machinery, repayment of rupee term loans and externalcommercial borrowings.Banks have also been extending credit for investment in the asset market.Like many other EMEs, asset prices in India have also risen sharply in the lastcouple of years.  Should there be reversal of capital flows, asset prices maydecline sharply exposing the banks’ balance sheets to credit risk.  There is a riskthat rise in interest rates in general could impact housing prices and expose thebalance sheet of the households to interest rate risk, leading to some loan lossesfor banks. The overall banking sector’s exposure to housing loans is relativelysmall and may not have serious systemic implications. Likewise, the equitymarket has also seen a sustained uptrend. Reversal of capital flows could impactthe equity market and some of the advances extended for investments in theequity market might turn non-performing.  Again, Indian banks do not have largeexposure in the asset market though, in the recent past, it has been increasing.Decline in asset prices could cause loan losses and capital losses, if the declineis significant, though the impact on banks’ balance sheets might be muted, giventheir small exposure to the asset market.The most significant impact on banks’ balance sheet, however, could befelt through their investment portfolio. Banks in India hold substantial investmentsin Government and other fixed income securities. Such investments amounted toUS $ 173 billion, constituting 35.1 per cent of their total assets as on September16, 2005.  To the extent a rise in international interest rates impacts the domesticinterest rates, it would entail marked-to-market losses on the investmentportfolios.The banking sector, however, has acquired some added strength toabsorb such probable shocks, largely aided by regulatory actions. Apart fromhaving built up a significant capital base reflected in the capital to risk-weightedassets ratio (CRAR) for the sector of 12%, specific steps have been taken tomeet the interest rate risk. First, separate provision for capital against market riskhas been introduced. Second, a gradual building up of Investment FluctuationReserve up to 5% of the marked-to-market portfolio (out of tax-free profits) byMarch 2006 has been mandated, and several banks have already achieved thetarget. Third, an enabling risk management environment has been provided tobanks to hedge their risks through vanilla derivative instruments. Fourth,Conservative accounting norms followed did not allow banks to book unrealizedgains. Fifth, as a one time measure, banks were allowed to transfer securities toHTM, after booking the MTM losses against these. Thus, banks in India, ingeneral, have the resilience to withstand some rise in interest rates.Impact on the Real SectorReadjustment of the currencies would also have implications for the realsector.  Significant readjustment of the currencies and rise in interest rates couldslow down the global growth. This would entail a reduction in export opportunitiesand reduction in investment demand for EMEs, in general, many of whichdepend on export demand to sustain their growth. Rise in interest rates, byslowing down spending, may have a negative impact on the global economicgrowth.  Thus, readjustment of the currencies may affect several EMEs in asignificant way.The impact of any slowdown on India may be assessed with reference totwo factors. First, India's economy is largely domestic-demand driven. WhileIndia’s exports constituted 11.5 per cent of GDP, its share in the world trade isonly 0.8 per cent. Second, India's exports basket is fairly diversified.Some concerns arise with regard to the implications for employment incase of a slowdown in the exports sector, especially with regard to the significantspecialisation in BPO/IT Enable Services.  Rapid job growth that absorbs thehuge supply of agricultural labour into its industrial work force is necessary forsocio-economic stability in India. Any negative impact on employment resulting insubstantial decrease of real earnings and widening income inequality is likely toreduce overall welfare and increase the cost of structural adjustments required,especially in the absence of meaningful social safety nets. Monetary and Prudential Measures as responsesThe outlook for output growth in India has improved in the recent months,particularly with the momentum gained in manufacturing sector. However,persistence of global imbalances and high oil prices with a significant permanentcomponent do pose some risks.  Furthermore, the credit growth has recentlybeen extremely strong possibly impacting credit quality, while money-supply isover-shooting the anticipated trajectory and strong investment demand coupledwith high oil-prices is turning the current account surplus into a deficit, thoughmodest and manageable through normal capital flows.  These developmentspose new challenges to maintaining price and financial stability while ensuringmomentum in growth.  Consequently, in the Mid-Term Review of Annual PolicyStatement for the year 2005-06, released on October 25, 2005, several measureshave been announced to contain and manage the downside risks.First, the reverse-repo rate (overnight liquidity absorption by ReserveBank) has been increased by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent, keeping thespread between reverse repo and repo at 100 basis points.  The Bank Rate,being the signalling rate for medium term, is retained at 6.00 per cent.Second, rationalization of limits on banks’ exposure to capital market hasbeen announced, restricting it to 40 per cent of a bank’s net worth whilesimplifying the exemptions and coverage.Third, the general provisioning requirement for standard advances hasbeen enhanced from the present level of 0.25 per cent to 0.40 per cent except inregard to Banks’ exposures to laggards in credit-growth, namely, Agriculture andSmall and Medium Industries.Fourth, a decision had been taken to treat the entire balance underInvestment Fluctuation Reserve as Tier I capital, thus providing some head-roomto banks to raise Tier II capital in future.Fifth, revised guidelines are being issued on corporate restructuringmechanisms to be followed by banks in the light of experience gained.Sixth, having regard to the recent trends in the credit markets, RBI isinitiating a supervisory review process with select banks having significantexposure to some sectors, namely, real estate, highly leveraged non-bankingfinancial companies, venture capital funds and capital markets.  The purpose ofsuch a review is to ensure that effective risk mitigants and sound internal controlsare in place for managing such exposures.Some ReflectionsFrom the above discussion, it is clear that the Impact on India woulddepend on the pace and extent of currency and current account readjustments,and changes in global interest rates. While India by itself hardly contributes toglobal financial imbalances, any large and rapid adjustments in major currenciesand related interest rates or current accounts of trading partners could indirectlyimpact the Indian economy.From the case of India, it is also clear that readjustment of the currenciesand rise in interest rates would impact different EMEs differently. Despite rise inshort-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, instead of rising, havemoderated, leading to a further flattening of the global yield curve and narrowingdown of credit spreads. EMEs have taken advantage of favourable financialconditions. During the first half of 2005, EMEs focused on operations aimed atmeeting domestic and external obligations and lengthening maturities. However,higher global interest rates could contribute to widening of emerging market bondspreads, particularly those with high debt to GDP ratio. In view of expecteddeceleration in financial conditions, some emerging markets have cushioned byadvancing their external financing, taking advantage of current benign financialmarket conditions. Emerging market economies have, however, continued toimprove their debt structures in an effort towards reducing their vulnerability toexternal shocks. EMEs have carried out active liability management operationsaimed at meeting their financial requirements while minimising the cost of debtand its risks. Some countries have taken steps to develop their local markets andhave reduced the amount of foreign currency-linked domestic debt, whilegradually improving the maturity profile. Some of the EMEs have also reducedthe share of domestic debt indexed to the exchange rate.Compared to the past crises, the EMEs, in general, are now resilient andin a better position to absorb a financial shock. They have developed resilienceto shocks by improving their macroeconomic conditions and regulatoryframeworks. EMEs have been achieving a healthy growth with more or lessstable inflation and have reduced their dependence on external demand. Therehas also been an improvement in fiscal positions, supported by the developmentof domestic securities markets.  The external debt burden has declined and thecomposition of financial flows has changed with lower reliance on borrowingsfrom international banks. Several EMEs have addressed the weaknesses that ledto the earlier crisis by strengthening prudential regulation and supervision morein line with international best practices. Banks’ balance sheets have improvedand capital ratios have risen. Corporate governance practices have alsoimproved. To the extent EMEs have introduced flexibility in their exchange rates,their vulnerability to external shocks has declined. All these factors have reducedthe vulnerability of EMEs.  Large reserves held by EMEs should also enablethem to cope with the volatility arising out of a sudden shift in market sentiment.While macroeconomic fundamentals of several EMEs are strong, placingthem in a relatively better position to withstand deterioration in internationalfinancing conditions, economic performance of some EMEs has been found to beless robust. The conditions in these economies may get accentuated byadjustment of global financial imbalances and high and volatile oil prices. Apossible volatility in the global financial markets emanating from a rise in interestrates could magnify and propagate the problems associated with less thansatisfactory performance in some of the EMEs, making them vulnerable tosudden reassessment of country risk. Such threats are real as the default ratesof sub-investment grade borrowers could increase. Credit derivatives, whichhave proliferated in recent years and whose pricing has depended on relativelyuntested models and default correlation assumptions, may in particular bevulnerable to corrections.The main challenge for EMEs is to continue to take advantage of thecurrent favourable external financing conditions and at the same time pursuedomestic macroeconomic and structural reforms necessary for long-termstability. In fact, some EMEs have well-advanced external financing, in some3cases even including prefinancing for 2006 .  EMEs have made significant gainsin terms of healthy growth, stable inflation, large trade surplus, greater exchangerate flexibility and lower debt burden.  While EMEs are preparing  themselves toface sudden shocks, efforts need to be made by all concerned for an orderlyadjustment of global financial imbalances. While co-ordinated policy action wouldminimise the cost of rebalancing, perhaps, a stress testing by all the concernedregulators in the EMEs to assess the extent of the resilience could be helpful.The EMEs, despite their diversity, seem to generate expectations of highgrowth and are generally characterized by less-than-fully developed markets,specially financial markets.  Consequently, there are significant cross-bordercapital flows, with market perception of high risk and high reward in EMEs.  It isuseful to note that implicit in the word “emerging” in the very title given to theEMEs as a group, is the notion that they are undergoing a rapid change ortransition.  We must recognize that the transition embraces demographics,political institutions, social dimensions and related attitudes.  These all-encompassing changes have an in-built potential for uncertainties, possibly somevolatility, but it gets exacerbated by the international capital flows, particularlywhen the changes in such flows happen to be unrelated to domesticfundamentals.  In such a situation, managing the transition turns out to be acritical challenge for policy making, and the management requires a more difficultand dynamic trade off between commitment and flexibility in policy.Overall, while added risks – both upside and downside – are inevitablewith increasing global financial and economic integration, the EMEs mayconsider strengthening their resilience through not only sound macroeconomicmanagement but also by adopting appropriate prudential measures. Over aperiod, co-ordinated efforts, both at regional as well as global levels, could alsohelp EMEs to cushion themselves better against the risks of financialglobalisation.Thank you,                                                                                                                                                                            3 Global Financial Stability Report, September 2005, IMF.AnnexSelect Economic Indicators – Select Emerging Market Economies(US $ billion) Country GDP Inflation Trade Current Foreign Exter- Overall Export of1 2(growth rate Balance Account Reserve nal Budget goods and1 2 3 4rate) s Debt Balance services to5 @to GDP GDP1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Argentina 10.1 9.7 11.2 2.8 24.4 166.2 -3.3 24.0@Brazil 3.9 6.0 40.1 12.5 54.6 235.4 -1.5 22.5Chile 6.5 3.0 8.7 0.6 15.8 43.2 -0.3 38.0@China 9.5 1.3 93.1 68.7 711.0 193.6 -1.7 40.2Colombia 5.3 4.9 1.8 -0.8 14.9 33.0 - 19.1Czech Republic 5.1 1.7 1.3 -4.1 30.2 34.6 - -Egypt 4.7 4.7 -9.5 4.4 18.5 31.4 - 25.5Hungary 4.1 3.6 -3.4 -9.2 18.0 45.8 - -@India 7.0 4.1 -34.7 -6.4 133.6 113.5 -4.5 15.4Indonesia 5.5 8.3 27.8 7.8 31.0 134.4 -1.2 31.3Israel 4.8 1.6 -7.7 1.3 27.8 - - -Malaysia 4.1 3.7 23.6 16.7 78.0 49.1 - 121.3@Mexico 3.1 4.0 -9.6 -8.4 66.4 140.0 -0.3 30.1Peru 4.9 1.2 4.0 0.4 12.8 - -1.8 19.6Philippines 4.8 7.2 -0.7 2.9 15.3 62.7 -4.0 52.0Poland 2.8 1.6 -3.3 0.3 39.4 95.2 - 22.6@Russia 6.1 12.4 110.6 69.2 146.0 175.3 4.4 25.6South Africa 4.5 3.9 -2.3 -8.6 17.2 27.8 -1.0 28.2South Korea 3.3 2.0 26.0 21.3 206.6 - - -Taiwan 3.0 3.6 1.7 13.3 254.1 - - -Thailand 4.4 5.6 -7.3 -2.2 47.3 51.8 -2.8 -Turkey 4.2 7.9 -38.9 -20.0 42.9 145.7 -19.6 27.0Venezuela 11.1 14.8 24.7 17.7 23.1 34.9 - 35.71.
