1 Joint Function of   RBI and Government of Karnataka  on Financial Literacy Project in Karnataka  Bangalore: March 22, 2010  Governors Remarks  ________________________________________________________    Respected Chief Secretary, Government of Karnataka Shri S.V. Ranganath and  friends,    I am delighted to be present here at this function organized jointly by the  Government of Karnataka and the Reserve Bank of India. Over the last one year we  have done a number of functions across the country as part of RBIs platinum  jubilee celebrations. This function this afternoon here in Bangalore is easily one of  the most exhilarating functions. It was particularly heart warming to listen to  children speaking on financial issues. For the first time, I get a feeling we are  making a solid start on Financial Literacy. Our Honble Finance Minister Shri  Pranab Mukherjee and the Chief Minister of Karnataka Shri B. Yeddyurappa had  shown lot of interest to take part in this program. Due to some unforeseen urgent  works, they were unable to attend this function. However, they have sent their good  wishes for the program.                                                      1  English Translation of Governors address which was delivered in Kannada   2. When I came here for the Reserve Banks Central Board Meeting in May  last year, I had an occasion to call on the Chief Minister, Shri Yeddyurappa and  explained to him the role of responsibilities of the Reserve Bank.  I also told him  about the Reserve Banks efforts to further financial literacy and financial  inclusion.  The Chief Minister showed great interest and requested that we take  Karnataka as a pilot state for launching our initiatives and offered the full  cooperation of the Government of Karnataka for this purpose.  Over the last eight  months, the Reserve Bank worked closely with the Government of Karnataka on  several initiatives.  Todays function is a culmination of these efforts.    3. There are three distinct events we are marking today.  (i) The first is the release of text books for Classes V, VII and IX  containing lessons on finance.    (ii) The second is the launch of the Electronic Benefit and Income  Transfer (EBIT) Scheme.    (iii) The third is distribution of prizes to state-wide winners of the RBI  quiz competition conducted across schools and colleges of the State  of Karnataka.    4. Let me now say a few words about the significance of each of these events.    5. The Reserve Bank attaches top priority to deepening financial literacy.  This  means that school children and college students should acquire basic proficiency in  financial concepts.  Why is this important?  This is important both for you as  individuals and for the country as a whole.  When children grow up and start  earning, they should know their options  where to save, when to save, how and how much to save.  Only when you are able to evaluate your options will you  become responsible adults.  This is important at the aggregate level too.  When you  save, your money becomes available to the government and to other private sector  for investment.  And that investment raises our growth rate and creates jobs.  I want  all of your school children and college students to study well, in particular try and  understand the world of finance.  I also want to request the Education Department  of Government of Karnataka to do an evaluation of the introduction of the finance  curriculum after one year.  Based on your feed back, we can improve the lessons  and instruction material both here in Karnataka and all other states.    6. Now let us know more about financial literacy.  Banking facilities are still  not available to many villages.  Out of about 6 lakh villages in our country, 5.7 lakh  villages still do not have any bank branch.  At the earliest, banking facilities should  be provided to these villages.  For this purpose, technology should be used to open  no frill accounts.  The banking facilities can be made available the door step of the  villages by appointing one of the villagers as banking correspondents.  Bio-metric  smart cards may be provided to the no-frill account holders.  Bio-metric smart  cards  should be imbedded with photograph and finger print of the account holder.   This facilitates acknowledgement for the transactions done by the depositor.  Their  day-to-day transactions may be uploaded to the bank branch either through  telephone or internet.  The benefit of government schemes may be directly and  speedily credited to these no frills accounts.  This is being implemented in six  districts of Karnataka with an aim to extend the same through out the country.     7. We have organized various curricular and non-curricular programmes for  improving financial literacy amongst school children.  The Education Department  of Government of Karnataka have revised the high school textbooks for the year  2010-11 as per our suggestions.  As part of non-curricular activities we have  organized State Level Quiz Competition.  About 6100 schools and 3000 colleges  took part in this competition.  We got a splendid feedback for this from the school  children.  Childrens knowledge about banking and RBI has amazed us.    I hope  that our endeavour in this direction has laid a strong foundation for the future  citizens of the country to become fully financially literate.     8. Before I finish, on behalf of the Reserve Bank, I want to thank the Honble  finance Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee for his very strong and enthusiastic  support for financial literacy and financial inclusion, and the Chief Minister Shri  Yeddyurappa for the co-operation extended by Government of Karnataka under his  leadership.
