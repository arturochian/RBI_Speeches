At the outset, on behalf of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India andGovernment of India, I extend a hearty welcome to all the Central Bankers of SAARCRegion on their visit to India and particularly to Reserve Bank’s College of AgriculturalBanking. I also feel honoured for the privilege bestowed on me to inaugurate the Meeting of2.  It is in fitness of things that the Meeting is being held in this city which is known as the‘City of learning’ in and around which  great Indian philosophers and educationists  heldsway for over centuries. The scenic surroundings of the College of Agricultural Banking andsalubrious climate of Pune, I am sure will provide the necessary ambience for sharing theinherent supervisory skills and learning on each other’s country experiences.3. The theme of discussions of such Inter Central Bank Meets used to centre around coreeconomic or monetary policy issues.  However, in the context of the South East Asianfinancial crisis and its contagion effect on the financial system of some of the even wellestablished global economies, Regulation and Supervision over the financial vehicles hasaround the world have also started working towards strengthening prudential norms andenforcing transparency in financial reporting by financial institutions to avert any future4.   The regulatory and supervisory framework for banks and other institutions in India havealso undergone significant changes keeping in pace with the reforms introduced in thefinancial sector. The details of these changes will be presented in greater detail by mycolleagues from RBI in the coming sessions. I would like to highlight some of the moreimportant ones to serve as a backdrop for the fruitful discussions that are slated to followafter this inaugural session.Prudential Norms5.  The focus of the statutory regulation of commercial banks in India till the early 1990s wasmainly on licensing, administration of minimum capital requirements, pricing of servicesincluding administration of interest rates on deposits as well as credit, reserves and liquidasset requirements. In these circumstances the supervision had to focus essentially on6.   After evolution of BIS prudential norms in 1988, RBI has taken  a series of measures torealign its supervisory and regulatory standards almost on par with the international bestpractices. At the same time it also took care to keep in view the socio-economic conditions ofthe country, the business practices, payment systems prevalent in the country and thepredominantly agrarian nature of the economy and ensured that the prudential norms wereapplied  over the period and across different segments of the financial  sector in a phasedExposure Norms1manner.

The ratioof permanent investment to total investment has been reduced from a high of 70% in1992-93 to 30% in 1998-99 and the intention to mark 100% of bank’s investments tomarket (as current investments) over the next 3 years has already been announced. Whileappreciation in the value of securities is ignored, depreciation has to be fully providedfor.7.  The aforesaid prudential standards compare favourably with some of the international bestNew Supervisory Initiatives8.  The entire supervisory mechanism has been realigned since 1994 under the directions of anewly constituted Board for Financial Supervision (BFS), which functions under the aegis ofRBI, to suit the demanding needs of a strong and stable financial system. The supervisoryjurisdiction of BFS now extends to the entire financial system barring the Capital marketinstitutions and the insurance sector.9. The periodical on-site inspections as also the targeted appraisals by the Reserve Bank arenow supplemented by  off-site surveillance  which particularly focuses on the risk profile ofthe supervised institution. A process of rating of banks on the basis of CAMELS in respect ofIndian banks and CACS ( C apital, A sset Quality, C ompliance and S ystems & Control) in10. The Off-site Monitoring and Surveillance System (OSMOS) was introduced in 1995 asan additional tool for supervision of commercial banks to supplement the on siteexaminations. The system consists of 12 Returns (called DSB Returns) focussing onsupervisory concerns such as capital adequacy, asset quality, large credits and concentrations,connected lending, earnings and risk exposures (viz. Currency, liquidity and interest raterisks). As part of first tranche, 7 Returns have so far been operationalised and the secondtranche of returns on risk management aspects and consolidated supervision are expected to11.   The supervisory intervention by RBI is normally triggered by the deterioration in thelevel of capital adequacy, NPAs, credit concentration, lower earnings, and larger incidence offrauds which reflect the quality of control.Internal Control Systems12.  Like the central banks in developed supervisory regimes, RBI also has started placing anincreasing reliance on professional accountants in the assessment of internal control systemsof the banks and non-bank financial institutions. Over the period, the responsibilities ofauditors have been delineated not only to make the audit more detailed but also to make themaccountable. The methodology and processes used to generate available data as certified by3      be introduced by next year.  respect of foreign banks has been put in place from this year.      practices already in vogue in developed economies.   Marking Investments to Market   audit profession would improve the reliability of financial statements as regards theirconformity with national accounting and disclosure standards.13. Another area of crucial importance is strengthening of internal control systems in banks.The Reserve Bank has, over the years, emphasised the need for having an effective internalcontrol system in banks. Banks have also been advised to introduce the system of ConcurrentAudit in major and specialized branches. As a result, all commercial banks have introducedconcurrent audit since 1993 by using external auditors as a major resource. The banks arenow required to set up Audit Committees to follow up on the reports of the statutory auditorsand inspection by RBI. Similarly, immediate action is warranted on reconciliation of interbranch accounts which if left unreconciled, is fraught with grave risks. Substantial progresshas been made by banks in reconciliation of the outstanding entries, and BFS reviews theOperational Strength of Indian banking system14.   It is now commonly acknowledged that the Indian banking sector has, as a result of theon going reforms, emerged strong and resilient.  The public sector banks which sufferedlosses of Rs.3,293 crore  in 1992-93 and Rs.4,349 crore in 1993-94  i.e. in the initial years ofintroduction of prudential norms, have, ended  the year 1997-98 with a net profit of Rs.5027crore. Net NPAs of public sector banks formed 8.2% of the net advances and 3.3% of thetotal assets as at the end of March 1998.Evolution of Risk Management System15. Financial institutions carry a wide range of risks, including credit, interest rate, foreignexchange, liquidity, operational and reputational risks. These risks are highly interdependentand events (whether expected or unanticipated) that affect one area of risk can haveramifications on other risk categories. In the context of deregulation of interest rates in India,market risk has now emerged as an area requiring immediate attention on the asset side of theBalance Sheet. In recognition of this, RBI has issued to the banks draft guidelines (with thefinal guidelines becoming operational from April 1, 1999), for a broad framework for asset-liability management taking into account the variance in the business  profile of banks in thepublic sector and private sector as well as the data/information base available to banks inTransparency and Disclosure Standards16. Another area where RBI has moved ahead, is to impart greater transparency to thebalance sheets of banks.  This was a logical step after the adoption of prudential norms, withthe banks in India coming under greater international scrutiny. During the last couple ofyears, the range and extent of disclosures has been gradually increasing so as to provide aclearer picture to informed readers of balance sheets.  The banks are now required to disclosethe break-up of the provisions made towards NPAs, depreciation of investments and other17. With effect from 1997-98, banks are required to disclose accounting ratios relating toincome heads like, operating profit, return on assets, business per employee and profit peremployee. From year ending 31 March 2000, the following information among others,4India.should also be disclosed by the banks operating in India  in the published accounts:st  purposes besides, capital adequacy ratio and the level of net non-performing assets.            progress in this area at quarterly intervals.  • • • Movements in NPAs & Provisions,• 18.  The primary objective of any supervisory regime has to be prudential, viz., to protect thesafety and soundness of domestic banking systems. Its application can at the same timeprovide an incentive for other countries to improve the quality of their prudential supervision.If banks want to operate in other markets where these core principles are strictly applied, theywill have to convince the authorities in the host countries that the quality of supervision intheir home country is adequate. This can create powerful new incentives for improvements insupervision. Recently, I had the privilege of associating myself with the Willard Group ofBank for International Settlements (BIS) constituted by G 10 countries to look into theseaspects. The Group has come out with recommendations which call for close coordinationamongst central banks and governments of the world as well as the international financialinstitutions like IMF and World Bank in promoting stability, accountability and transparencyAdoption of Core Principles andUniform Accounting Standards19.  The Core Principle for Effective Banking Supervision (1997) evolved by the BasleCommittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) have been accepted for adoption by RBI. TheCore Principles seek to promote and enhance the standards of supervision. Incidentally, Imay add that the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) is also workingclosely with the BCBS on reducing differences in supervisory approaches to loan valuationand credit loss provisioning. In many areas of banking supervision and securities regulation,international consensus has been reached and principles or standards have been established.In other areas there still is a need to define best practices and develop standards. The lack ofinternational consensus on sound practices for loan valuation, loan-loss provisioning andcredit risk disclosure seriously impairs the ability of market analysts as well as regulators toSupervision over Non Bank Financial Institutions20. I would like to specifically mention about the far reaching supervisory initiatives on thepart of RBI which has now brought all India Development Finance Institutions and NonBanking Financial Companies under an intensive supervisory framework through both on-site inspection as well as off-site monitoring procedures.Development Finance Institutions21.

Prudential Norms relating to income recognition, asset classification, provisioning andcapital adequacy have also been prescribed for IDBI, ICICI, IIBI, and EXIM Bank in March, NABARD and NHB in March 1996.Supervision over NBFCs23. RBI has been regulating the NBFCs which numbered around 40000 companies for overthree decades since 1963. The regulatory role upto 1997 was confined to deposit acceptance24.  In the context of increasing functional diversity and expanding intermediation role ofthis sector, RBI through enabling legislation to its regulatory powers has taken a series ofsteps for compulsory registration and liquidation of recalcitrant and defaulting companies inrepayment of public deposits.  An entry norm of minimum net owned funds at Rs.25 lakhs25. A Registration process to cover as many as 7689 companies was initiated in July 1997and has been completed by December 1998. Simultaneously, prudential guidelines have beenput in place to govern the various aspects of their functioning besides bringing them undermore intensive on-site supervision based on CAMELS pattern. More detailed presentation onsome of the innovative supervisory practices and extensive use of technology for dataMillennium (Year 2000) Issues26. I would like draw your attention to one of the current IT related issues viz. Y2k problemwhich is pursued by RBI more as a business continuity risk than a technology problem.Initiation of Supervisory measures by RBI is in synchronisation with the standards set byBIS. RBI has an enlarged role of monitoring and enforcing the compliance by the entirefinancial sector and co-ordinates its efforts with the National level Task Force set up by thePrime Minister of India.27. Major policy initiatives taken in this regard focus on  promoting increased awareness,establishing targets and benchmarks for industry, Industry-wise status assessment,maintaining pro-active supervisory pressures. RBI  has issued circulars in September 1997 tocommercial banks explaining the Y2K problems and possible solutions. Targetted on-siteappraisals have been commissioned by RBI to verify the compliance efforts on the part ofbanks.28. A target date of 31st December 1998 was fixed for ensuring Y2K compliance and banksmay be subject to penal measures in case of persisting non-compliance beyond March 1999.Institutions have also been advised to put in place appropriate contingency plans to take careof possible system failures. A High Powered Working Group in RBI under the chairmanshipof Deputy Governor and with representatives drawn also from banking industry reviews the29. As you would have observed from the foregoing, Indian Supervisory system has alreadymade much headway in realigning itself to the emerging needs, particularly addressing therisks inherent in liberalisation and globalisation of Indian Economy after the advent of6progress made in compliance at regular intervals.compilation and analysis is slated to follow during the last session of this Meeting.was prescribed for the purpose of registration.activities of NBFCs and did not cover the asset quality and liquidity mismatch aspects.1994 and to SIDBIfinancial sector reforms. The prudential norms adopted by Indian banks in the area ofmarking the investments to market conform to the international standards. The disclosurenorms already prescribed for Indian banks as part of accounting standards do conform to theglobal best practices besides ensuring transparency in published  accounts. The only areawhere the BIS standards are yet to be implemented in full are those relating to Assetclassification, particularly in respect of re-defining NPAs as those past due for a quarter(instead of 2 quarters as at present) and reduction in the period for classifying such accountsas doubtful from 24 months to 12 months. We are however making earnest efforts in this30. The banking system had acquired at the time of introduction of prudential norms for thefirst time in 1992-93 a large quantum of non-performing credit which can be termed aslegacy NPAs. It is worth mentioning that the incremental NPAs in subsequent years havebeen at much lower levels. The level of NPAs in the Indian banking sector is beingcommented upon as an alarming one by various international and domestic analysts/groups.At the same time, these agencies have rather chosen to ignore the high level of NPAs whichhave totally eroded the banking systems in the East Asian countries with many bankinginstitutions folding up as a consequence. In this background, it has to be mentioned that theNPAs of Indian banking system have already been provided for more than  50 per cent whichis often ignored by the international agencies while evaluating NPA status of Indian system.Further, Indian banks secure their loans to a very large extent by collaterals.  The banks inIndia do not normally prefer to write off loans covered by collaterals during the pendency ofcases in law courts. Looking into the delays in realisation of collaterals, it is of paramountneed to focus our attention on expediting legal reforms recommended by the Committee onBanking Sector Reforms (Narasimham Committee II). The banks also have to activate the31. Another factor which contributed for build-up of  NPAs in the past was lack of focussedattention on the end use of funds by the borrowers. The borrowers in many instances went forprojects and purposes other than those included or prioritised in the original schemessanctioned by the banks. To avoid such a situation, the banks have already started paying lotof attention on end use of credit. RBI expects  the banks to  set up an efficient andappropriate loan review mechanism for this purpose.32. As you would have observed from the foregoing, we have covered a lot of grounds instrengthening our prudential regulation and supervision system of the financial system overthe last few years. I can proudly claim that these efforts of the central bank in this directionhave helped in sustaining the health of Indian banking system enabling it to  withstand the33. There is lot of pressure to reduce the asset classification norm to one quarter in respect ofpast due loans and lot of discussions have taken place in this regard at various internationalfora. However, we have taken a view that the international practices should not be merelymimicked but should be carefully evaluated and applied to a country’s specific situationkeeping in view the support systems.  In countries like India and even in some welldeveloped countries, the trade and commerce cycle combined with payment settlementsystems extends beyond a quarter. Unless the underlying commercial and payment systemsmove towards faster settlement of trade transactions, we do not see any immediatecompulsion to shift to a norm for asset classification of one quarter in respect of past dues.7contagion effect of the East Asian syndrome.procedures of compromise settlements and their recovery machinery towards faster recovery.direction to make our banking system more transparent and vibrant.34. I should stress at this point that it is easy to introduce stricter norms but it requires lot ofdiscipline to resist leeways sought by banks arising at implementation stage. We are not infavour of such leniencies. We strongly believe that once the norms are laid by the centralbank, it should be complied with in letter and spirit  by the constituent institutions. Though ithas taken some time for us to introduce the prudential norms I am sure that the banks in Indiafollow these norms as a gospel.35. I would like to conclude with a request to the participating financial supervisors to focustheir deliberations and try to arrive at possible ways of addressing emerging areas ofsupervisory concern which are not just regional but universal due to interdependency offinancial systems across the globe. I shall particularly like the supervisors’ discussions tocentre around assessment of supervised institutions’ capabilities in Management of NPAs,installing appropriate business and operational Risk Management systems, enhancingtransparency in disclosure standards and earnestness in introduction of effective Internal36. I would like to record my appreciation for the excellent arrangements made by theCollege of Agricultural Banking and untiring efforts on the part of its Principal, Mr.S KNewlay and his colleagues in hosting the Meeting. I am sure that no efforts will be spared bythe team in looking after the comforts of the visiting dignitaries from other central banks37. I hereby inaugurate the Meeting and wish the deliberations would turn out to beproductive, fruitful and successful .8 during their stay.Control Mechanism.
