Key note address by Dr. Y V Reddy, Deputy  Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at the CII  seminar on `Emerging Scenario in Foreign  Currency Management' on February 20, 1998 in  Mumbai    Key note address by Dr. Y V Reddy, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, at the CII seminar  on `Emerging Scenario in Foreign Currency Management' on February 20, 1998 in Mumbai.   Emerging Concerns and State of  Indian Economy  Chairman and friends,   On this occasion, I propose to address the limited issue of identifying the emerging concerns on  the state of economies of emerging markets with particular reference to recent developments and  place before you a factual account of the current scenario in the Indian economy.   The Recent Crisis  The recent crisis has many unique features which are worth relating as a backdrop to the current  concerns.   First, it was unexpected, by almost all concerned i.e., Governments, multilateral institutions, rating  agencies and market participants.   Second, it is unusual since its origin is not of low economic growth or low savings or high  government deficit or financial repression but in a way failure of the market mechanisms or  private sector.   Third, it is pervasive since it is a crisis of currencies, corporates stocks and banking.   Fourth, it is the most contagious so far, with an impact, initially on neighbours, then other  developing countries and soon developed world also.   Fifth, it is still, by and large inexplicable though the immediate cause appeared to be sudden  confidence erosion and global scale herding by market participants.   Sixth, the response of the official policy makers and the international financial community seems  to have been often delayed and pretty much behind events - following or reacting to events rather  than shaping them.   Seventh, it is not only pervasive and widespread but also deep - say the extent of depreciation of  some currencies.  Eighth, while there are some similarities between the directly affected countries, there are  significant dissimilarities.   Ninth, similarly while there are some internal causes (i.e. domestic situation or excessive short- term borrowing and lending to non productive sectors) there are also some external causes (i.e.,  global factors such as developments in Japan and China, including in particular excessive lending  from major financial centres.)   There are three important aspects of the crisis which we need to note.   Firstly, it appears to be a case of unrealistically high expectations and disappointment on the part  of participants.   Secondly, there is still some lack of consensus on the appropriate response, as also the role of  relevant institutions.   Thirdly, and most important to all this, there is a widespread agreement that the concerned  economies will bounce back but the issue is, how soon and at what cost, even if they are  transitional. Also, bounce back will necessarily be different for different affected countries.   Areas of Concern  It is not, therefore, surprising that there are new concerns expressed, or what may be called  emerging concerns. These relate not only to the state of economy or policies of each of the  emerging markets but also the broader role of Government, aspects relating to market failures in  both capital exporting and importing countries, sovereignisation of private debt, financial sector  liberalisation especially regulation of banks, volatility of capital flows, pace of capital account  liberalisation, regulatory systems in major financial markets, exchange rate management,  international bankruptcy procedure, role of multilateral agencies, and of course international  lender of last resort, etc.   Emerging Concerns and Indian Economy  Broadly speaking, there are five major areas of concern today, whenever one analyses an  emerging economy. These relate to macro-economy, external sector management, regulation of  the financial sector, the state of corporate sector and the broader issue of transparency in the  system. More important, the specific aspects of concern in each are different now compared to  say a year ago. Without entering into a debate on the appropriateness of such concerns or the  differences about what should be a concern or what magnitude should engage attention, I will  address clearly identifiable areas currently being looked at by market participants and the present  status of Indian economy in respect of each of these.   Macro-Economy  The annual growth rate of Gross Domestic Product has been in the range of 7 to 7.5 per cent  during the last three years (i.e., fiscal years 1994-95 to 1996-97). For the current year, estimates  range between 5.0 to 6.0 per cent. Investments as a percentage of GDP has also been  reasonably steady in the period at around 26 per cent on the average.  The current account deficit as a per cent of GDP has been consistently in the range of 1 to 1.8  per cent, and has averaged 1.3 per cent, and the current year's position would not be very  different.   Fiscal deficit of Government of India as a percentage of GDP had come down gradually from 6.1  per cent in 1994-95 to 5.5 per cent in 1995-96 and 5.0 per cent in 1996-97. Though there are  some fiscal strains, it is hoped that there would be no directional change.   The annual rate of growth in Broad Money (M3) was 22.3 per cent in 1994-95, but dropped  subsequently, pulling down the annual average growth rate between 1994-95 and 1996-97 to  17.3 per cent and in the current year it should be around 15.5 per cent. There is a similar pattern  in regard to inflation, which averaged 7.4 per cent between 1994-95 and 1996-97 and the  wholesale Price Index this year is estimated to be around 6 per cent, less than last year's 6.9 per  cent.   Finally, non-food credit growth has averaged 21 per cent per annum in the last three years and  this year it is expected to be around 20 per cent including investments in PSU and corporate  bonds, debentures and CP.   As you may be aware, the latest CSO estimate places GDP growth of 1996-97 at 7.5 per cent  and net capital inflow from abroad for the last two years has been placed at 1.86 and 1.15 per  cent of GDP at market prices.   External Sector  On the external front, in SDR terms, exports have grown at 13.6 per cent and 16.7 per cent  during 1994-95 and 1995-96 while imports have grown at 18.0 and 23.7 per cent. Last year,  (1996-97) there has been a deceleration to 9.6 and 10.6 per cent, respectively. This year, during  April-December, growth of exports was 9.1 per cent and that of imports 13.5 per cent, both in  SDR terms.   The Foreign Direct Investment flows continue to rise and are USD 2.5 billion during April- December 1997-98 as against $ 2.7 billion during the whole of 1996-97. More important, the  policy framework and the procedures ensure that most of the value of FDI flows to infrastructure  and productive sectors.   FII investments during the current year so far are less compared to $ 1.9 billion for the entire  1996-97; but, it is expected that it would be at least $1 billion during this year. The flows on  account of external aid last year, commercial borrowings and non-resident deposits are positive  on a net basis, and broadly as per expectations at the beginning of the year.   The invisibles have also been on track and as a result, the foreign currency reserves as on  February 6, 1998 are higher at $ 24.4 billion compared to $ 22.4 billion at the beginning of the  financial year.   More important, some mention about external debt management and magnitudes would be in  order. The RBI controls by a process of approval of each case, the total short term debt, including  trade related credit beyond 180 days. Our short-term debt as a per cent of our reserves is around  27 per cent, while as a per cent of total external debt, it is about seven per cent. Each external  commercial borrowing, including maturity, interest terms etc., has to be approved by the  Government/RBI. In fact, a micro level productive use of such external debt is ensured during the  approval process. In fact, our volume of external debt has been generally on the decline and  during 1993-97 total external debt was reduced by one billion US Dollar, while there was accretion to reserves of the order of US $ 16.6 billion. Indeed, strict control over external debt is  the cornerstone of our external sector liberalisation.   Sometimes, the issue of forward liabilities of the central bank is raised. We have been very  cautious by generally limiting such aggregate outstanding liabilities and rarely does it exceed 10  per cent of reserves. Of course, there is no rigid rule. We observe great prudence in these  matters while exercising flexibility. We publish all such operations from time to time. Finally, the  exchange rate is flexible but volatility has been and is being checked by the Reserve Bank of  India.   Financial Sector  As most of you may be aware, we have adopted international standards of capital adequacy for  banks, and their non-performing assets are closely monitored with a view to bringing them down.  In particular, I would like to emphasise some major features. First, our banks' total exposure to  assets of Asian and East Asian countries was less than US $ 500 million, and foreign liabilities  are well below 10 per cent of total liabilities.   Second, lending to property is frowned upon and is generally restricted to housing finance.   Third, lending to stocks is also severely restricted and there is a ceiling of 5 per cent of  incremental deposits for this purpose. Actually, very little of this facility has been used.   Fourthly, by virtue of close monitoring and approvals required and in the absence of derivatives  etc., off balance sheet items of banks are minimal and closely monitored.   Fifthly, the banks are permitted to borrow or invest abroad only up to 15 per cent of their net  unimpaired capital.   The authorised dealers (apart from a few money changers) on foreign exchange are almost  always banks, whose exposures, open positions etc. are closely monitored.   Sixthly, the non banking financial companies have been brought under tight legislative, regulatory  and prudential framework recently.   Corporate Sector  The debt of corporates as a percentage of equity, on the basis of annual surveys audited by the  RBI indicates that corporate debt of 1730 selected non-financial public limited companies was  76.5 per cent of the extent of equity in 1993-94 and it has come down to 57.9 per cent in 1995-96.   Also, as a percentage of total debt, external debt was about 10 per cent in respect of large  corporates and less than 2 per cent in respect of all corporates covered by the study in respect of  756 selected companies.   At the present juncture, therefore, corporate sector of India as a whole is not overexposed to  external liabilities.   Transparency On all areas of public interest involving RBI's operations, press releases on a daily basis are  common. The Reserve Bank releases a weekly statistical supplement which is virtually a balance  sheet of the RBI and captures monetary, fiscal and external sector developments. In addition, the  monthly bulletin of the RBI gives a wide array of information, including for instance forex  operations of the Reserve Bank. One can note all the forex transactions of the RBI, including  outstanding forward liabilities in the monthly bulletin. The formal statements of Governor,  especially on monetary and credit policy developments clearly express a view of monetary and  credit developments. The Annual Report in Trends in Banking contains a wealth of authentic  information and the latest issue gives bank-wise ratios relating to performance. The  Parliamentary oversight and occasional recourse to judiciary by affected parties ensure that an  acceptable degree of transparency is maintained.   Conclusion  In brief, we ensure sustainable current account deficit, restrict reliance on short-term external  debt; limit access to external debt and emphasise productive use of such debt. We encourage  Foreign Direct Investment as the main source of non-debt creating capital inflows. Also,  exchange rate is market determined though the RBI closely monitors and occasionally intervenes  to avoid volatility as also ensure orderly conditions in forex markets. We undertook financial  sector reforms, especially banking reform as a prelude to liberalisation of some capital account  transactions in the external sector. We discourage banks' investments in real estate and stock  markets. Non-banking financial companies are currently subject to regulation. Corporates  exposure to debt, especially external debt is within reasonable limits, though growing. There is  transparency in operations of the Reserve Bank of India - whether it is forward market or whether  it relates to performance of banks. In fact, the RBI takes initiatives in the orderly development of  money market, Government Securities market and foreign exchange markets. We hold constant  formal and informal consultations with market participants on these issues. To conclude, we  believe that market participants should note these features of current state of our economy in  assessing our prospects - both short and medium-term.
