Pro-Poor Growth: New Realities and Emerging QuestionsI am thankful to the organisers for inviting me to participate in this Seminar.  Thedocument of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on the subject is very comprehensiveand incisive.  It is difficult to add much to it so far as strategies outlined therein areconcerned. There are, however, some new realities, especially due to compulsions ofglobalisation and technological progress that impinge on policies relating to povertyalleviation.  Similarly, the changing balances in the policy mix between the State and theMarket affect the role of multilateral financial agencies, which need to be addressed.  Ipropose to set out the emerging issues in the light of the Indian experience in reform, andits impact on poverty, to illustrate the process of pro-poor growth and would concludeGlobalisation necessarily involves greater competition and a drive towardsefficiency.  In such a situation, the Government concerned would face severe limitationsin imposing taxes that are out of alignment with the international imposts – be it tax oncross-border flows of commodities and services or domestic production.  In fact, somestipulations, such as those under the World Trade Organisation (WTO), impose severeconstraints on tax-discretion of national Governments.  Furthermore, expansion ofactivities of multinational corporations with huge scope for transfer-pricing (which isbecoming increasingly difficult for bureaucracy to detect in view of productcomplexities), the expanding scope for cross-border services where incomes andexpenditures get interwoven, the increasingly large element of service embedded ingoods, the growing use of electronic commerce, and the easiness of international travelresult in a situation where higher than internationally prevalent rates of taxation becomecounterproductive.  Moreover, when trading in physical products is replaced by that indigital products, issues of tax jurisdiction become paramount.  High rates of taxes onfinancial capital or individuals with highly tradable skills would also be difficult.  Allthese factors limit the capacity of Government in raising resources on a significant scalefor large-scale public spending - in particular the spending in favour of the poor. To takecare of the poor, it is possible to have mandated or regulatory prescriptions on otherinstitutions such as corporates but such a course of action will tantamount to taxingdomestic entities and tending to make them globally non-competitive.  The majorinstrument for public action in favour of the poor in the framework of globalisationwould have to be through higher growth, and through orientation of the pattern of growthto impart benefits of such growth to the poor.Given the constraints on taxation as instruments for raising resources to benefitthe poor, globalisation would have to ensure that expenditures are prioritised in favour ofpublic goods including institutional development, environment and basic public goodslike education and health.  To the extent public expenditures are pre-empted to maintainglobal competitiveness, they serve both growth and the poor.Globalisation and Technological Progresswith a few general observations.Friends,iOne important consequence of globalisation is that it tends to direct resources towardsactivities where private returns are high. This has implication for poverty.  Globalisationmay, therefore, require strengthening the presence of government in certain sectors,In the above background, there are two important areas requiring attention.  First,how does the international community enable countries, which have a large existingpopulation of the poor, typically among the relatively low income countries, to handle theThere is also the more general issue of the impact of globalisation ongovernments.  With globalisation, most goods and services as well as all factors,especially capital and technology tend to be mobile over the borders but mobility ofpeople is not free.  Governments have to manage the social dynamics, including tensions,of residents without a reasonable freedom to manage corresponding economic factors.The problem is especially acute in respect of countries, which start with an overhang oflarge-scale chronic poverty.  There is perhaps a need for the international community toconsider arrangements that provide support to them to assure a level playing fieldbetween such countries during a transition period.  Dealing with chronic poverty mayalso require a well-designed and well-managed social safety system.  Globalisation withits pressure points on reducing the role of the government may in fact, exaggerate theproblem of chronic poverty for a longer period, when the asset distribution is skewed andThere is also a case for attending to transitory poverty, which may be man-made,due to large scale financial crises, as happened recently, or acts of nature such as droughtand flood.  International institutional arrangements to tackle both transitory and chronicBriefly stated, globalisation requires international safety-nets for the poor on a globalscale and the international community including the ADB has to consider this aspectwhile promoting growth, and the pro-poor aspect of growth among member countries.Technological progress has been a driving force in growth, and indeedglobalisation.  This process has given rise to some sense of job-insecurity among theworkforce, both in developed and developing societies.  Fears are not restricted to effectsof financial crises alone, but are related to the process of technology-led growth itself.The growing worker insecurity is a result of fear of potential job-skill obsolescence.  Theproblem is far more serious when there is a large workforce which is yet to acquire or beimparted skills, since the policy question arises as to what types of skills are relevant.Completion of secondary school level has so far been, by and large, enough to equip aworker with skills to last a lifetime, perhaps with occasional on-job training.  This maynot be so in future.  In fact, high-skill biased technology-change on a global scale mayundermine efforts at reduction in poverty, though growth may be significant unless there2The question is how do we devise them?poverty may be needed to protect the globe from several adverse consequences.direct entitlements of poor are curtailed.problem of fiscal constraints imposed on them by globalisation.where social returns are higher than private returns.is equally high spillover effect.  Also, the distributional impact of globalisation may beaddressed.  The question is : What are the choices available to policy-makers indeveloping economies with concentration of the poor to tackle this technology inducedPeople, Governments and multilateral institutions have been committed to endingpoverty, but there were serious ideological differences among governments on how toachieve this goal. In this context, differences were acute in regard to relative roles of thestate and the market.  However, more recently, there has emerged a reasonably commonground in the approaches to solving economic and financial problems.  The near-convergence of ideology reflects the growing linkages or integration among theeconomies, leading to greater compulsion to find common solutions.  The consensusseems to be veering towards redefining the role of the state to take full advantage ofmarkets in maximising growth and welfare, in the context of the overall reduction in thepower of the State or Governments relative to individuals.  Technology has widened,deepened, and spread rapidly among all, with the result individuals (to include corporatesor non-governmental organisations) are able to operate and organise themselves withaccess to the same level of technology and even resources as the Governments.  As aresult, Governments seem to be powerless in enforcing censoring of news, especially onthe net.  This shows that the balance between government and individuals has changed inalignment with the changing balance between the State and the Market.Further, mobility of goods and services, especially capital flows, among nationsincreased enormously, and most large capital flows are on private account.  Thus,international financial flows also reflected the changing balances between the State andthe Market.Reflecting the movement towards ideological conformity, multilateral institutionshave become more representative of all nations with a virtual universal membership.These institutions which were created by governments, are necessarily subject tochanging balance against governments and in favour of individuals, including markets.The multilateral institutions like the Bretton Woods institutions or the ADB have, as aresult, become more representative, and relatively less significant in terms of resourcestransfer; and yet more critical in terms of their influence on the function of the economiesin the increasingly integrated world. It is, however, clear from the recent developmentsthat in the context of the changing balances, the institutions which are purely creations ofgovernments require additional clout to be effective. The question is : how to buildinternational arrangements that will include non-governments for addressing globalThere is also a discernible change in the recent past on what constitutes the globalchallenge.  Till a few years ago, the balance of payments was the domestic problem of acountry needing policy corrections by the government but often on the advice of theInternational Monetary Fund. Now it is clear that it has become a global concern3challenges.State, Market and Multilateralism :insecurity?requiring international coordination.  For instance, poverty in an intricatelyinterconnected world has the potential of having a contagion effect through, internalThe recent institutional innovations such as the Financial Stability Forum and theG-20 are interesting examples of informal arrangements to ensure stability by combinednational and international endeavours. These do, however, include governments, centralbanks, regulators, and multilateral institutions. Similar initiatives could be considered inrespect of poverty alleviation. It is in fact possible to harness managerial skills, and to theextent possible, material or financial resources of individuals and corporates to aid theThe UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has come up with an idea that the UN needsto focus on people rather than governments, and harness technology for humanitarianpurposes.  Indeed, it may be useful to explore a Poverty Alleviation Forum (PAF) withclose involvement of corporates, technology-leaders, financial intermediaries, and non-governmental organisations or self help groups, say under the aegis of an internationalorganisation such as the ADB.  The main objective of such a forum should be to arrive ata consensus on managing globalisation, while ensuring not merely financial stability, butCurrently, there is an interesting debate in India on the impact of economic reformon poverty alleviation.  The data and analysis, whether in terms of direct poverty ratios orindirectly looking at unemployment and wages are reported to suggest that in the 1990s,especially in the years after the onset of reforms in mid-1991, rural poverty reduction hasbeen arrested while urban poverty recorded a decline.  Though the conclusions of thesestudies are tentative and reliability of data is often questionable, it is noteworthy that theIn linking poverty reduction with reform and growth in India in the nineties, thefirst question that arises is with regard to the counter factual, viz., if there were no reform,would the reduction in poverty ratios have continued. Perhaps, the policy package of the‘eighties, which delivered a respectable rate of growth in GDP and a reduction in poverty,was unsustainable, since the achievements during the  ‘eighties were, in a sense, based onborrowed money, both domestic and external.  It can even be argued that the price forsuch unsustainable policies of the ‘eighties is being paid in the ‘nineties.  Further, it couldbe argued that, in view of the international and domestic uncertainties, particularly in therecent years, the vulnerability of the economy and also of the poor would have beensevere in the absence of reform.  For example, the latest oil shock went almost unnoticedThe second question, given the increasing inequalities among the States in respectof growth performance in the reform period, relates to whether the poverty reduction hastaken place mainly in those States which have registered impressive improvements in real4in India.increased GDP growth and moderate inflationary pressures have helped alleviate poverty.Reform and Poverty Issues in Indiaalso poverty-alleviation.process of poverty alleviation – both transitory and chronic.health hazard say, a virus or a disease, and could pose a global challenge.growth of State Domestic Product (SDP).

Thus, State-level and intra-state level analysesdeserve to be looked into carefully before arriving at the conclusion that the reform-The third question relates to what Dr. C. Rangarajan (former Governor of theReserve Bank of India and presently Governor of the State of Andhra Pradesh) pointedout viz. the fact that all poverty-alleviation programmes of the pre-reform era have beencontinued during the reform period.  It must be noted that major poverty alleviationprogrammes such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) continue to operate and thePDS continues to be virtually absent in the States where there is concentration of poverty.Hence, the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes is dependent mainly on howThe fourth question is a possible linkage between the sectoral composition ofgrowth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the existence of poverty.  Studies revealthat growth of the primary-sector has a significant impact on rural poverty, while growthin the tertiary sector has on urban poverty. Growth in the secondary sector, does not onFinally, the fact remains that, while evidence of stagnation on poverty-levels isnot conclusive, there is no evidence of significant reduction in the aggregate of peoplebelow poverty line to correspond with the impressive economic performance as permacro-economic indicators such as growth in GDP and inflation.  This calls for a reviewof public policy to assure a pro-poor policy in pursuit of growth.In terms of public policy, it would be u seful to take into account the experience inthe pre-reform as well as the post-reform periods and the constraints imposed on publicpolicy due to globalisation and technological change, and explore the emerging questionson the appropriate policy package to enable the pro-poor view of growth to succeed.  TheFirst, given the fact that the status of agriculture is an important determinant ofrural poverty, should there be a greater focus on public investment in agriculture, which5has been decelerating recently?issues in this regard clearly appear to be many, and a few major ones are listed here.Public Policy for Pro-Poor Growththe other hand, seem to have a significant impact on poverty.focussed are the efforts at implementing them.strategies have not been successful in reducing poverty.reduction in poverty.Second, is it possible that, as some studies indicate, expenditure on roads,agricultural research and irrigation have a greater impact on poverty alleviation thanThird, is it possible that higher growth in agriculture facilitated byFourth, whether improvements in the design and implementation of povertyreduction programmes including the public distribution system would yield the desiredFifth, whether removal of all price based subsidies, direct or indirect, andSixth, studies have also shown that in periods of ‘distress’ such as drought,poverty alleviation programmes make impressive welfare impact.  In such an event, isthere a case for substantial and automatic launching of such programmes on a massivescale while in normal circumstances, public investments, especially in agriculture andSeventh, what would be the role of local bodies, which are being revamped inmany States, and of non-Governmental organisations, in both growth oriented andpoverty alleviation programmes? Would it be appropriate to consider them as goodvehicles for such centrally designed programmes only or should they be encouraged totake interest in multidimensional approach to poverty alleviation and empowerment ofEighth, one question relates to the link between the instrument of povertyalleviation and the objective which is best illustrated with food-subsidy.  The changes inthe budget-allocation for food subsidy could reflect changes in the level of stocks offoodgrains and the carrying-costs rather than any concrete provision of benefit to theconsumers.  In this context, the Reserve Bank of India has commissioned a study onNinth, while the poor are heavily concentrated in some parts of India, many of ourprogrammes directed to the poor are not adequately availed by them.  For example, microfinance initiatives taken by RBI have shown impressive results, and though spread overalmost all the States, two-thirds of micro-finance activity is in evidence in the Southernregion.  Experience shows that the outreach of micro finance tends to be small and it paysdividend to those who are capable and efficient.  Actually, it is successful in areas withpotential for non-farm activities and among clients with skills in non-farm business. RBIis continuing its efforts to spread micro finance to other areas as well, but clearly it can beFinally, economic reform, in a broad sense, would encompass realigning ofrelative functions of the Centre and the States.

Most of thesocial and a significant part of the physical infrastructure lies in the domain of the States.Expenditure responsibility of the States is, therefore, likely to grow in social sectors,particularly in education, health, sanitation and nutrition, even after reckoning for someOn the interstate plane, the new reality is a greater role for market-based resourcesfor the development of a State.  So, while the States need to be encouraged to competefor resources in the market, there should exist mechanisms in the transfer of resourceswhich would differentiate between the ability-consistent efforts and the ability-enhancingefforts.  This means that States which already have a reasonably developed institutional-support base and a strong fiscal position can garner resources from the market and,consequently, reduce their dependence on Central transfers.  In States where theinstitutional setting is underdeveloped, public policies may have to address the issue ofimproving their ability to access financial markets, while, at the same time, augmentingtheir resource base through transfers to help prepare them for a greater degree of self-sufficiency.  This has greater relevance now than before due to market orientation of thereform-process and observed regional inequalities, heightened by concentration of thepoor in underdeveloped States. The Reserve Bank of India had a series of meetings withState Finance Secretaries and in the latest meeting held last week, RBI has been involvedin three tasks viz. reducing interest burden on States’ debt, increasing maneuverability ofState budgets and analysing the multidimensional aspects of State budgets.l, the contribution of Reserve Bank of India in this regard should beconsidered in several aspects, price-stability being the most critical.  One of the strengthsof the Indian system is a strong aversion against inflation.  The secular inflation rate hasbeen very moderate even under difficult circumstances, and volatility has been minimal.A strong anti-inflationary bias in the macro policies provides a bulwark against anadverse impact on poverty.  The weakest segments of society have no defences againstinflation and hence the oft-quoted dictum in India is that an anti-inflationary policy is thebest anti-poverty programme and it is in this context that the role of the RBI gains pre-In the ultimate analysis, markets, however efficient they are, are not democraticinstitutions in the strictest sense, since customer’s vote is proportionate to his/herpurchasing power.  Secondly, labour is different from capital since the owner of capitalcan withhold if he/she thinks that the return is not adequate while labour cannot withholdbecause it will then not be able to survive.  He or she has to work to live.  Thirdly, thepoor can give according to their ability but if such abilities cease to have markets, theycannot get what they need even if the need is minimal.  Fourth, resource-transfer to therich is described as ‘incentives’  while income-transfer to the poor is described as a‘subsidy’ – commonly perceived to be a derogatory term.
