Globalisation of Monetary Policy and Indian Experience *Mr. White, Mr. Turner, distinguished central bankers and friends,I welcome you all to Mumbai and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to thisEighth Meeting of the BIS Working Party on Monetary Policy in Asia. It is anhonour for us to host this prestigious event for the central bankers. I would like tothank the BIS for extending this opportunity to the RBI.Perhaps I should share with you some background on the RBI. It is one ofththe oldest central banks in the developing world – actually it has entered 70year of its operations.  Lord Keynes had proposed a “State Bank” for India toperform central banking as well as commercial banking and thus, participated inthe process that led to consideration of establishing a central bank in India.  TheReserve Bank Bill was introduced in 1927 and the legislative process took sevenfull years. The debate, among other things, was focused on two inter-relatedissues:  one, the relationship between a colonial government and domesticfinancial sector, and two, whether the Bank should be established with private orgovernment shareholding. The issue was settled in favour of private ownershipand, in the meantime, the capital of the country was shifted from Kolkata (knownas Calcutta then) to New Delhi, and the headquarters of the Bank was legislatedto be in the financial capital of the country, namely, Mumbai (known as Bombaythen). The Bank was nationalised in 1949  and  thus  became  government-owned,  and,  not  unsurprisingly, reflected the example of the United Kingdom.Apart from the traditional central banking role, the RBI performed variousdevelopmental roles in tune with the national economic planning during the fourdecades 1950-1990.  With the initiation of reforms in 1991, the Bank redefined itsrole in the public policy arena, mainly in external and financial sectors. The roleof the Bank in monetary policy formulation had to evolve taking into account thereform-agenda before the country and the global developments.   In the address today, I propose to start by drawing your attention to whatmay be termed as the ‘globalisation of the monetary policy’ and the forces atwork shaping it.  Of course, each country has its own unique characteristics and2the impact of globalisation on domestic policies is not similar for all countries.  Inthis context, perhaps a brief review of the distinguishing features of the monetarypolicy in India, and an assessment of how the monetary policy has fared in Indiain the recent past would also be appropriate.The Globalisation of Monetary PolicyThe period since the 1990s has witnessed some convergence in theconduct of monetary policy, worldwide. Currently, there are striking similarities inthe tools that monetary authorities employ to assess macroeconomicdevelopments and the formation of expectations. In the choice of instruments aswell as in the operating procedures, there are common features. The institutionalarchitectures have begun to display several commonalities. The communicationstrategies and, thereby, the public accountability are in the forefront in all centralbanks with progressively increasing globalisation of financial markets andemphasis on central bank autonomy. Finally, there is greater universalrecognition of the trade-offs confronting monetary policy decisions.While individual country experiences vary in tune with country-specificdiversities, the cross-country evidence highlights the fact that there are severalcommon features driving this phenomenon.First, cycles of economic activity have become increasingly synchronizedacross countries, irrespective of the level/stage of development.  Second, there isnow widespread recognition of the adverse implications of high fiscal deficits onthe conduct of monetary policy.  Third, there have been significant shifts ininstrument mix.  Drastic reductions in statutory pre-emptions, greater reliance onindirect instruments, emphasis on flexibility and timing of policy response and, ingeneral, a greater market orientation are all major elements of this shift.  Fourth,there is a greater activism in liquidity management and a focus on the short-endof the market spectrum; this has also been engendered by the growingintegration of financial markets domestically and internationally. Fifth, at anoperational level, there is greater transparency amongst the monetary authoritiesas a strategic objective.  This, in turn, has brought in emphasis on information3management – the quality and quantity of data dissemination represented byrelease of adequate, timely and reliable information in a standardised form, anddissemination of information on the dynamics of policy decisions.  Sixth, there isgreater coordination between central banks, fiscal authorities and regulatorybodies governing financial markets.  Seventh, there is a greater focus onappropriate institutional structures that promote efficiency in the conduct ofmonetary policy.  Eighth, in an environment of synchronized economic activity,international policy coordination has become extremely important.  Finally, thereis a greater recognition that amidst the generalised uncertainty, monetarymarksmanship is better adjudged in terms of ranges rather than in preciseestimates.These developments have been globally associated with a distinctlowering of inflation. In conjunction with more effective communication policies,this has earned for the monetary authorities what has been described as a“credibility bonus,” which has helped in building a reputation for them in achievingthe objectives of monetary policy.  There is also a greater sophistication in theconduct of monetary policy today, and central bankers are constantly engaged inrefining their technical and managerial skills to deal with the complexities offinancial markets.On the downside, the challenges facing monetary authorities havebecome sharper.  The heightened uncertainty surrounding the conduct ofmonetary policy has made interpretation of macroeconomic and financial datadifficult.  Uncertainty is more easily transmitted across the world than beforethrough the ‘confidence’ channel, forcing the monetary authorities to contend withthe contagion from shocks.  Since the 1990s, considerations of financial stabilityhave assumed an increasing importance in monetary policy across the globe.It is useful to recognise some of the forces at work that indicate the paceof such globalisation of monetary policy.  First, the increasing flow of goods andservices across national borders brings about networking of production systems,even standardisation of products, tastes and preferences. Second, financialintegration powered by mobile capital flows leads to the merging of financial4markets across national borders. Third, the explosion of communicationtechnology makes this integration even closer and faster. Fourth, since the late1980s, a factor driving the globalisation of financial sector is the setting ofcommon standards in terms of prudential regulations, supervisory practices anddisclosures. Under these conditions, monetary policy responses in variouscountries have tended to exhibit common characteristics. Undoubtedly, completecongruence of national monetary policies is not feasible because of country-specific factors but there are growing elements of globalisation in the sense thatthere are considerable similarities in the overall setting and conduct of monetarypolicy.The Indian ExperienceIn reality, while there are growing tendencies towards globalisation, theconduct of monetary policy depends on a number of factors that are unique to acountry and the context.  Given policy goals, the contours of the monetary policyare shaped by the macroeconomic structure of the economy and its institutionalsetting.  Other important factors that have a decisive role are the degree ofopenness of the economy, the stage of development of financial markets,payment and settlement systems and the technological infrastructure.  Againstthis backdrop, let me now turn to the specific features of the monetary policy inIndia.First, although there is no explicit mandate for price stability, the conductof monetary policy has evolved around the objectives of maintaining pricestability and ensuring adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of theeconomy for sustaining overall economic growth. The relative emphasis betweenprice stability and growth depends on underlying macroeconomic conditions. Inessence, monetary policy in India strives for a judicious balance between pricestability and growth. The democratic processes in India work in favour of pricestability which, in some ways, amounts to an informal mandate to the centralbank for maintaining an acceptable level of inflation.5Second, the monetary policy framework in India is guided by a ‘multipleindicator’ approach wherein besides monetary aggregates, information pertainingto a range of rates of return in different financial market segments along with themovements in currency, credit, the fiscal position, merchandise trade, capitalflows, the inflation rate, the exchange rate, refinancing and transactions in foreignexchange – which are available on a high frequency basis – is juxtaposed withdata on output and the real sector activity for drawing policy perspectives. Thetransition to a multiple indicator approach has been a logical outcome ofmonetary policy reforms. It has provided necessary flexibility to the RBI torespond more effectively to the changes in domestic and international economicand financial market conditions. In a medium-to long-term perspective, theimpact of money supply on inflation, however, cannot be ignored and for thepurposes of policy, the Reserve Bank still continues to announce projections ofmoney supply compatible with the outlook on GDP growth and expected inflation.Third, liquidity management is carried out through open market operations(OMO) in the form of outright purchases/sales of government securities andreverse repo/repo operations, supplemented by the newly introduced MarketStabilisation Scheme (MSS). The Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), introducedin June 2000, enables the Reserve Bank to modulate short-term liquidity, of atemporary nature, under varied financial market conditions in order to ensurestable conditions in the overnight (call) money market.  The LAF operatesthrough reverse repo and repo auctions, thereby setting a corridor for the short-term interest rate consistent with the policy objectives. The LAF operations,combined with strategic OMO consistent with market liquidity conditions, haveevolved as the principal operating procedure of the monetary policy of theReserve Bank.           Fourth, notwithstanding concerted reforms undertaken since the 1990s,e.g. freeing monetary policy from the burden of automatic monetisation and asignificant marketisation of the government’s borrowing programme, monetarypolicy in India continues to be constrained by the fiscal dominance.  Debtmanagement considerations of ensuring a smooth passage of the borrowing6programme of the government, at minimum costs and roll over risks, make theoverall monetary management difficult when large and growing borrowing yearafter year puts pressure on the absorptive capacity of the market and on liquiditymanagement.  In this context, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget ManagementAct of 2003 which envisages a vacation of primary financing of the fiscal deficitby the Reserve Bank from 2006-07 would enhance the flexibility for monetarymanagement.Fifth, the predominance of publicly-owned financial intermediaries has itsimplications for  monetary policy.  Cross holdings and inter-relationships in thefinancial sector emphasised in planned development were to achieve the socialgoals of the “joint family” headed by the Government. These are being graduallyrevamped consistent with the needs of a market economy.Sixth, a factor that further complicates the transmission mechanism ofmonetary policy is the limited size of the Indian financial system. Although Indiais essentially a bank-based economy, commercial credit penetration in the Indianeconomy is still relatively low. Concerns about credit to agriculture and small-and medium- enterprises usually relate to inadequacy, constraints on timelyavailability, high cost, neglect of small and marginal farmers, low credit-depositratios in several States and continued presence of informal credit markets withhigh interest rates. It is in this context that the monetary policy in India continuesto take cognisance of the need for ensuring financial inclusion of all segments ofpopulation, interests of depositors and for promoting a conducive credit culture.Seventh, the Indian financial system still shows some signs of  stickinessin interest rates. Consequently, apart from the efforts to ensure reduction inexisting high levels of revenue and fiscal deficits, rationalising administeredinterest rates on contractual savings to impart efficiency and operational flexibilityto the financial sector is amongst the priorities in policy.Eighth, monetary management in India is somewhat constrained by thelack of comprehensive and timely information in some areas relative to thedemands of a fast growing and increasingly globalising economy. One lacuna isthe absence of credible data on the labour market. Employment data essentially7pertain to the organised sector which constitutes less than 10 per cent of the totallabour force. There is also considerable ambiguity about the very definition of‘employment’ given the prevalence of under-employment and disguisedunemployment. In the absence of data on the natural rate of unemployment, it isdifficult to assess with reasonable level of confidence the underlying conditions.Similarly, an assessment of the inflationary conditions in the economy isconstrained by the lack of a comprehensive measure of consumer price inflation.The multiple consumer price indices, on the basis of occupational classificationand residence (rural/urban), compound the problem, especially when differencesin weighting diagrams of the commodity baskets lead to differences in inflationnumbers.Ninth, the financial system in India, however, has a relatively lowvulnerability to asset bubbles. There is limited exposure of bank lending to thesensitive sectors, including real estate. While the demand for housing is strong,overall exposure is moderated by assigning higher risk weights to housing loansthan required under the Basel norm.  The share of housing loans in the overallloan portfolio stood at about 10 per cent in March 2004 and net non-performingassets were 1.4 per cent of the net outstanding loans as compared with 2.8 percent of the aggregate portfolio.An AssessmentAn assessment of expectations vis-à-vis outcomes suggests thatmonetary policy in India has performed reasonably well in terms of its objectives.First, compared to many developing countries, India has been able tomaintain a moderate level of inflation.  Historically, inflation rates in India haverarely touched double digits and when they did, it was the result of supply shocksfrom agricultural commodity prices or international oil prices.Second, monetary policy has been reasonably successful in dampeningthe volatility of output and imparting to the economy a growing resilience. Thetrend rate of GDP growth has risen steadily to around 6.0 per cent for about 258years, and India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in theworld.Third, monetary policy has been successful in ensuring financial stability inIndia through a decade and a half when frequent visits of financial crises led todebilitating losses in growth and welfare in large parts of the developing world.This period was also marked by pressures from within such as geo-politicaltensions, drought and international sanctions.  While we might have enjoyed anelement of luck, we believe that we also benefited from exercise of soundjudgment and enhancement of skills at all levels. It is useful to note that theReserve Bank has been engaged in the development of sound and efficientfinancial intermediaries and markets so as to provide solid foundations foreffective transmission of monetary policy.Fourth, success has been achieved in turning around and strengtheningthe external sector.  Restrictions on imports have been virtually abolished andcurrent account convertibility has been instituted since 1994.  The capital accountis virtually open for non-residents. An exchange rate policy of focusing onmanaging volatility with no fixed rate target, while allowing the underlyingdemand and supply conditions to determine the exchange rate movements overa period in an orderly way, has stood the test of time. India’s external sectormanagement has been endorsed by the growing international investorconfidence in the face of sub-investment grade sovereign ratings. Today, Indiaholds the sixth largest stock of reserves in the world, sufficient to cover its entireexternal debt. Since 2002, India has turned creditor to the IMF and is engaged inpre-paying bilateral and multilateral debt.The conduct of monetary policy is getting increasingly sophisticated andforward looking, warranting a continuous upgradation of monitoring scan andtechnical skills.  Flexibility and timeliness in policy response coupled withtransparency and accountability hold the key to further enhance credibility. Aboveall, the monetary authority has to address dilemmas, which exert conflicting pullsat every stage, and blend the desirable with the feasible.  We have to recognise9that judgements are involved at different stages which call for both knowledgeand humility.I conclude, wishing you all success in your deliberations.*  Inaugural address by Dr. Y.V.
