Capital inflows to developing countries have many beneficial effects, especiallyin financing investment and economic growth; but they are also sometimes problematicfor policy makers in developing countries.  Large capital flows could push up monetaryaggregates, create inflationary pressures, destabilise exchange rate, affect domesticfinancial sector, and finally disrupt the economy if and when such flows get reversed ordrastically reduced. The experience so far has, therefore, brought to the fore the issue ofmanaging such flows – specifically, how to maximise the benefits of such flows, andminimise costs of such flows, including the cost of risk of reversal of such flows. India isa relatively late entrant into the league of recipients of large private capital inflows and isstill not a dominant player.  Yet, there is a lively interest in the way in which Indiamanaged its capital flows, maximising growth and minimising costs - including thecontagion effect.  I intend sharing with you our experience in managing capital flowsThe presentation will be in nine sections and these would cover: (a) the growth path androle of capital flows in the ‘eighties and during the reform period, (b) policy frameworkfor capital flows, (c) size and composition of capital flows, (d) tools of management ofcapital flows, (e) link with current account management, dollarisation, andinternationalisation, (f) exchange rate management, (g) crises-avoidance strategies, (h)Growth Path and Capital FlowsMacro parameters, viz., rate of growth in real Gross Domestic Product, savings andinvestment rates, movements in the incremental capital output ratio, current accountdeficit, capital flows and foreign exchange reserves, growth of money and domesticA quick look at the data presented in Table I will reveal that the growth rate in real GDPwas consistently above 5 per cent throughout the ‘eighties and ‘nineties so far, exceptduring the adjustment year of 1991-92. The investment rate has been consistently high atover 20 per cent during the period with over 90 per cent financed by gross domesticsaving.  The current account deficit was kept low below 3 per cent of GDP, barring thecrisis year of 1990-91.  On the inflation front too, a reasonable record was maintainedbarring a few years when it reached double digit.  Broad money growth and domesticcredit expansion have been, by and large, under control and more recently reserves havegrown  both in absolute terms and as a proportion to imports.Briefly stated, the dependence on external flows was restricted and as will be explained,was deliberately, as a policy, kept at low levels.

This meant that, until the ‘eighties; (a) financing ofinvestments was almost wholly through domestic saving with recourse to foreign flows atthe margin only; (b) reluctance to permit foreign investments or private commercial flowsin general; (c) almost total reliance on official, especially multilateral flows, mainly onconcessional terms; (d) recourse to IMF facilities to meet extraordinary situations such asthe drought in 1960s, oil shock of late 1970s, an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in the1980s and more recently, in the early 1990s, the Gulf crisis; and (e) relatively greateremphasis on import-substitution rather than export-promotion.  In brief, till 1980s,external financing was confined to external assistance through multilateral and bilateralIn the ‘eighties, global developments, particularly the perceptible decline in theavailability of official concessional flows in relation to the external financing needs ofdeveloping countries, changed the external sector situation at a time when India wasinitiating liberalisation. The compulsions of repayments to IMF during the late ‘eighties(of the EFF drawals in the early ‘eighties) added to the problems.  Hence, recourse toexternal debt on commercial terms became inevitable.  In addition to institutional sources(such as Export-Import agencies), syndicated loans and bonds, and deposits from non-resident Indians were accessed. These had to be supplemented, in the late ‘eighties withsignificantly large recourse to short term facilities including, in particular, short-termnon-resident deposits. The justification for this approach was to sustain the momentum ofgrowth of the Indian economy which jumped from around 3 per cent per annum during1950-80 to over 5 per cent in the ‘eighties, and to maintain the impressive exportThe onset of the ‘nineties, however, saw the impact of the Gulf crisis on India. with the large fiscal deficits of the ‘eighties and political uncertainties, repercussions ofthis development in the Gulf resulted in drying up of commercial sources of financing,withdrawal of non-resident deposits, large depletion in reserves and significant short-termdebt overhang, in what could be described as a severe liquidity crisis in the balance ofpayments.  Another global dimension that affected India’s management of the balance ofpayments during this period was the serious disruption of trade with the erstwhile USSRon top of worrisome recessionary tendencies in the industrialised countries and loss ofThe broad approach to reform in the external sector after the Gulf crisis was laid out inthe Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments chaired by Dr. C.Rangarajan.  The Committee recommended the introduction of a market-determinedexchange rate regime while emphasising the need to contain current account deficitwithin limits.  It recommended, inter alia  of current account transactionsleading to current account convertibility; compositional shift in capital flows away fromdebt to non debt creating flows; strict regulation of external commercial borrowings,especially short-term debt; discouraging volatile elements of flows from non-residentIndians; gradual  of outflows; and dissociation of Government in theThe policy framework for the external sector based on the Rangarajan Committee Reportwas implemented along with policy changes in trade, industrial and financial sectors.liberalisation2 of flow of external assistance. intermediationliberalisation ,export markets in West Asia.Combinedperformance of the late ‘eighties.sources, mostly on concessional terms to or through Government.Policy FrameworkUnder trade policy, there has been a virtual elimination of licensing, a progressive shift ofrestricted items of imports to Open General Licence (OGL), and lowering of tariffbarriers. Industrial policy has been characterised by delicensing, removal of monopolyclauses defining large industrial houses and removal of most reservations for publicsector enterprises.  The reforms in the area of financial sector were guided byrecommendations of the Narasimham Committee (1991).  Alongside the deregulation ofthe banking industry including entry for new private sector banks, the general thrust ofmonetary policy has been towards reduction in pre- emptions, greater recourse to openmarket operations, deregulation of interest rates and widening and deepening of financialmarkets.  Simultaneously, measures have been undertaken to strengthen the institutionalframework in banking, non-banking financial companies, financial institutions and stockmarkets through prudential norms, capital adequacy stipulations, improvements inpayments and settlement mechanisms and strengthening of the supervisory framework.Institutional measures have also included recapitalisation of banks, improvements in debtrecovery and most important, setting up of the Board for Financial Supervision andstrengthening Bank’s supervisory mechanisms.  A second Narasimham Committee(1998) has recently given a road map for further reform of banking sector, and a numberof recommendations on prudential norms have been announced in the latest policyFiscal adjustment has been undertaken and a very significant measure is that the systemmonetisation of the fiscal deficit has been replaced by a system of Ways andIn brief, reform in the external sector was meshed with reform in other related sectors andwithin the external sector reform, capital flows were managed keeping in view the needsof efficiency and stability.  There was a fairly smooth movement from an administeredexchange rate system to a market-determined exchange rate. Reserve Bank attempts toensure that volatility and speculative elements are curbed through both direct and indirectSize and Composition of FlowsTable 1 shows clearly that since the gradual liberalisation of capital account initiated in1991, capital flows were in excess of current account deficit (CAD )  except in 1992-93and 1995-96, thus adding to reserves. It is interesting to note that the stock of externaldebt came down steeply from US $ 99.0 billion to US $ 93 billion during the year 1995-96 or from 32.3 per cent of GDP to 28.3 per cent of GDP, not only on account ofvaluation changes but also due to the path-breaking policy changes that occurred duringthe period.  In fact, it will be interesting to note the difference between gross and netcapital flows during the period (see Table 2). Furthermore, the decline in debt reflectedthe policy-induced shift in the composition of the capital account in favor of non-debtAs regards composition of capital flows given in Table 3, private flows which averagedabout 47 per cent the in the ‘eighties, rose to 89 per cent in 1997-98.  The mostsignificant vehicle of private capital was Foreign Direct Investment which increased fromUS $ 47 million, i.e, less than 1 per cent of net capital flows in the ‘eighties to 3.7 billionor 28 per cent of net capital flows in 1997-98.Total portfolio investment flows on account of FIIs, GDRs and others have averagedaround US $ 2.6 billion during 1995-96 to 1997-98 despite a sharp drop in flows during3flows.measures.Means Advances.of automatic statement on Monetary and Credit Policy.1997-98 to $ 1.8 billion from $ 3.3 billion in 1996-97.  The dimension of these flowsshould be assessed in the light of the overall slump in global portfolio flows todeveloping countries witnessed during 1997-98. Net Disbursements of commercialborrowings have roughly been close to $ 3 billion during the last three years, reflectingthe policy of restraining commercial borrowings within sustainable limits.  The level ofshort-term debt, which was US $ 8.54 billion in 1990-91, was reduced to US $ 5.03billion by the end of March 1998.  Outstanding net forward exchange liabilities of RBI,which rose to 3.2 billion in January 1998 declined to US $ 1.2 billion in September 1998.In brief, the level of current account deficit and compositional shift in capital flowsThe process of liberalisation of capital account has been very gradual.  The appendedStatement shows the landmarks in regard to liberalisation of current account, capitalaccount, and exchange rate management bringing out clearly how the sequencing andBased on the policy frame and the projected financing requirement for each year,management of the capital account is operationalised through procedures for foreigndirect investment, portfolio investment, external commercial borrowings, NRI deposits,The broad approach to targeting of foreign direct investment has been through a dualroute, i.e., automatic and non-automatic, differentiated on the basis of sector and size andextent of ownership. For infrastructure and export-oriented units, 100 per cent of foreignownership is generally permitted.  Where the approval is automatic, activities and extentof ownership are listed while in regard to the rest, a case by case approval by a highPortfolio investments are restricted to select players, viz., FIIs.  They could, subject tosome restrictions, operate in equity and debt markets.  FIIs are, permitted to invest inequity subject to a ceiling of 10 per cent for individual FIIs in a single company and 30per cent collective FII investment ceiling in a single company. FIIs are also subject tohigher short-term capital gains tax of 30 per cent as compared to 20 per cent for localinvestors. The long-term capital gains tax for FIIs is at the same level of 10 per cent asfor local investors.  Indian corporates are permitted, again through a process of approvalof individual cases satisfying general guidelines, to access funds through GlobalEuroconvertibles.External commercial borrowings are also subject to a ‘dual route’, viz., a smallcomponent of automatic and a major part through case-by-case approval, based on thesize and sector.

An overall annualIn respect of NRI deposits, control over inflows is exercised through specification ofinterest rates or interest rate ceilings for different maturities in respect of deposits inselect schemes, while, more generally, variable reserve requirements are stipulated forencouraging or discouraging such flows.

Infact, even with a managed capital account, we had to contend with occasional surges incapital flows between 1993 and 1997.  In general, the short-term response has taken anumber of forms, viz., raising of reserve requirements, reviewing the pace of removal ofrestrictions on capital inflows, relaxation of end-use specifications,  ofcapital outflows, partial sterilisation through open market operations, and deepening theforeign exchange market by routing an increased volume of transactions through theThe prolonged stability in the exchange rate of the rupee from March 1993 came understress in the second half of 1995-96.  In response to the upheavals, the RBI intervened inthe market to signal that the fundamentals were in place and to ensure that marketcorrection of the exchange rate was orderly and calibrated.  Exchange marketintervention was supported by monetary policy action to withdraw liquidity.  Thepressures intensified towards the end of January 1996 and the first week of February1996.  The Reserve Bank undertook a number of measures to encourage the fasterrealisation of export proceeds and to prevent an acceleration of import payments.  Theinterest rate surcharge on import finance was raised, the scheme of post-shipment exportcredit denominated in foreign currency was scrapped and the RBI continued to interveneThe year 1997-98 and the first quarter of 1998-99 posed severe challenges in exchangerate management in the face of the threat of external contagion and other uncertainties.Distinct phases of exchange rate movements and response of RBI can be identified.During April to September 1997, excess supply conditions prevailed in the market andthe Reserve Bank undertook large net purchases of foreign currency.  From September1997 to mid-January 1998, acute exchange market pressure was staved off through saleof foreign currency, coupled with administrative  and monetary policy measures.  Mid-January to April 1998 marked the return of stability and enabled rolling back of tightmonetary measures introduced in January 1998.When the foreign exchange market was characterised by considerable uncertainties inMay-June 1998, several measures were announced by the RBI in June 1998 to reverse thedemand-supply mismatches in the market.  The market responded positively to thesemeasures, but in August 1998 there were fluctuations in the exchange rate in view ofinternational developments.  The RBI once again undertook strong administrative andmonetary measures, which included increase in the repo rate and the cash reserveA vigilant and proactive policy by the RBI was, therefore, essential to avoid crisis in theAn extraordinary situation arose in 1998-99 consequent upon imposition of sanctions andthe issue of Resurgent India Bonds (RBIs) is an interesting example of management ofcapital account in such a situation.  The RIBs were designed to compensate for theextraordinary events in 1998-99, which may have resulted in some shortfall in thenormally expected level of capital inflows in relation to the current account deficit whichwould continue to be well within 2 per cent of GDP.  Due to the sudden developments in1998-99, a temporary disruption in capital flows, especially debt flows was anticipated.liberalisation7highly unsettled environment of international currency markets.requirement of banks.actively in the spot, forward and swap/money markets.market.Instead of dipping into currency reserves, which may affect sentiment adversely, orcutting the current account deficit through drastic import cuts which would affect realeconomic activity, the alternative was to enhance debt flows at the least possible cost.There was a need to offset the adverse negative market sentiment created in theinternational capital markets due to downgrading of India’s sovereign rating to non-investment grade.  This could be done by demonstrably raising debt resources at a costlower than that any organised financial intermediary was prepared to provide in thecontext of the rating downgrade.  Raising resources through sovereign borrowing wasconsidered to be time consuming and in any case inadvisable as a maiden offering underadverse circumstances.  At the same time, it was necessary to ensure that amounts soobtained were restricted quantitatively to meet essential needs as a replacement fornormal debt flows by keeping an option for premature closure.  Furthermore, we had toensure that the borrowing had an appropriate medium-term maturity, say, five yearsRIBs, which are essentially in the nature of foreign currency deposits on par with FCNR(B), were devised keeping in view these considerations.  It was also necessary for RBI toforex or Government securities market.There have been three main points of criticism regarding RIBs, i.e., the cost of raisingA total amount of $ 4.23 billion has been mobilised at a moderate cost in a difficultinternational environment and in the face of recent downgrading of our credit rating.Some have called it the deal of the year.  To quote an international investor, “… the costat which funds have been raised imply a perceived sovereign rating three to four notcheshigher than current levels.

In return for a specific guaranteeRIBs, the Government can claim benefits in four ways, viz., addition to forex reserves,support to macroeconomic environment and sentiment, indirect support for its ownborrowing programme and resources for infrastructure development, including for publicsector entities.  It can also be argued that Government bears exchange risk in regard tobilateral and multilateral flows for its use or for onlending.  Moreover, given the Indiantrack record on prudent macro economic management, the burden of the exchangeAs evident from the foregoing analysis, liberalisation with respect to inflow of capital hasbeen substantial but gradual.

The Committee observed that although there were benefits of a more open capitalaccount, international experience showed that a more open capital account could alsoimpose tremendous pressures on the financial system. Hence, the committee indicatedThe three crucial preconditions were fiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target andabove all, strengthening of the financial system. The committee recommended areduction in Gross Fiscal Deficit / Gross Domestic Product  ratio from 4.5 per cent to 3.5per cent in 1999-2000 and a mandated rate of inflation for the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 at an average of 3 to 5 per cent. In the financial sector, the time frame for signpoststhat were recommended were in terms of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and non-performingassets ( NPAs). The recommendations were to reduce gross NPAs of banks as apercentage of total advances from 13.7 per cent in 1996-97 to 9 per cent by 1998-99 andto 5 per cent by 1999-2000, and the average effective CRR from 9.3 as of April 1997  to3 per cent by 1999-2000. committee then felt that the preconditions could be satisfied in three years, andtherefore, it adopted a three-year time frame for CAC. A basic dictum of the Committeewas that the timeframe for implementation of the measures could be shortened orelongated in accordance with the performance on the preconditions and that attainment ofpreconditions and implementation of measures should be considered as a simultaneousprocess. A significant feature was that the committee did not recommend unlimited oropen CAC, but preferred a phased liberalisation of controls on outflows and inflows overa three-year period. It may be noted that as per the committee’s recommendations, evenat the end of three-year period, capital account will not be fully open and some flows,Most of the measures related to removing the controls on outflows more than inflows.Specifically, it addressed issues such as investment abroad by Indian JointVentures/Wholly Owned Subsidiaries; retention of earnings by exporters/exchangeearners; investment by individual residents in assets in financial markets abroad; andmore liberal limits for banks in regard to borrowing and deployment of funds outsideIndia. In addition, the Committee addressed the issue of proper governance andtransparency, and the need to develop and gradually enable integration of forex, moneyIt would be useful to assess the current status with regard to both the measures and thesignposts recommended by the committee. The monetary policy of October 1997implemented some of the recommendations of the committee. These included, increasingthe retention portion of exchange earning in the foreign exchange account to 50 per cent, with prior approval from the RBI for execution of projects abroad, permitting to undertake forfaiting of medium-term export receivables, allowing corporateentities to open offices abroad without the need for prior approval from the RBI,providing credit/non-credit facilities to joint ventures abroad and permitting SEBIregistered Indian fund managers including mutual funds to invest in overseas marketssubject to individual and total overall caps.

We also experienced and managed phases of excessive capitalmovements: there were surges of capital inflows during 1993-95, and two major episodesof volatility in flows in the second half of 1995-96 and again during 1997-98. In theperiods of exchange rate volatility, there were major imponderables involved, bothexternally and internally, and contagion and herd behaviour had to be guarded against.
