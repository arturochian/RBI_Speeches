Speech of Finance Minister    Foundation Laying Ceremony for Security Paper Mill at Mysore, Karnataka    Mysore: March 22, 2010        Dr. Subbarao, Governor, RBI;    Mrs Thorat, Deputy Governor, RBI;      Members of the Board of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt. Ltd.  (BRBNMPL) and the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Ltd.  (SPMCIL);    Friends, ladies and gentlemen    2. It gives me immense pleasure to be here today, in this historic city of  Mysore, on the occasion of laying the foundation stone for the project for  establishing a state-of-the art currency notepaper production facility. I  congratulate Ministry of Finance and the RBI for having conceptualized the  architecture of this project, and put the implementation thereof on a fast track, in  a relatively short period of time.    3. Currency distribution is a key sovereign function and among the primary  functions of a central bank. It is also the most visible of its functions, as it  touches directly and immediately the common person. Hence, simply put, the  currency notes continue to occupy a key position in financial transactions being  carried out in the economy.    4.  As per Section 25 of the RBI Act, 1934, the design, form and material of  bank notes are to be approved by the Central Government on the basis of  advice tendered by the RBI. Section 22 of the Act gives RBI the sole right to  issue bank notes in India. The preamble of the Act enjoins the RBI to regulate  the issue of bank notes and operate the currency system of the country. The  wholly owned enterprises of the Central Government and RBI, namely, SPMCIL  and BRBNMPL are responsible for meeting the demand of Indian Currency  Notes. Thus, the Central Government and RBI have co-equal responsibility for  administration of currency related matters. This production unit, which has been contemplated as a joint venture entity between SPMCIL and BRBNMPL, in  equal proportion, reflects the need to maintain and further strengthen the co- operative endeavour, in this arena, between the Government and RBI.    5. Managing currency is a strategic function. One of the main challenges is  to be vigilant against the menace of counterfeit currency, which, if unchecked,  has severe consequences. Circulation of fake notes, in large numbers, can lead  to erosion of the value of legally earned wealth of citizens, fuel inflation through  oversupply of money, and adversely affect the security of the country by  surreptitious funding of illegal and unlawful activities. India is especially  vulnerable in this regard, since much of the counterfeiting takes place as State  sponsored activity by some countries and forces inimical to our interests. While  the magnitude of counterfeit currency in circulation has shown an increasing  trend in recent years, the magnitude of the problem is still within manageable  proportion, and, the total estimated fake currency is a miniscule proportion of  the money supply.  However, the growing threat casts a responsibility upon us  to ensure that our currency has high integrity, is not prone to duplication, and,  its distinctive features remain inviolate.    6. For a vast and growing country like India, indigenisation of various inputs  for manufacturing currency notes, namely, security features, paper and ink, is  cardinal to ensuring their integrity. However resilient the processes may be,  doubts will always persist so long as we have to depend on foreign suppliers for  meeting the requirements of ingredients that go into the making of bank notes.  India has posted several achievements in science and technology  not just in  the recent times, but right from the inception of human civilization. Therefore it  is not beyond our capacity to aim for producing all the building blocks that go  into production of currency notes.    7.  While we are wholly self reliant in the printing of currency notes, we are  largely dependent on imports for meeting the paper requirements. Presently,  the annual requirement of paper for printing of Banknotes is around 18,000  tonnes for printing of around 15-16 billion pieces of notes, with 95% of this  being imported from foreign suppliers. This requirement is expected to increase  further which implies that in the absence of adequate domestic manufacturing  capacity, our dependence on imports will increase. Besides, on account of increase in demand of banknote paper globally, without corresponding increase  in the production capacity of paper, the country may soon face a situation of  shrinking supplies and concomitant higher prices.    8. I am given to understand that this manufacturing facility at Mysore with a  production capacity of 6,000 tonnes per annum will be the first production line of  the Joint Venture. I am also told that the capacity will be increased to 12,000  tonnes in the second phase. These capacities will significantly redress the  demand supply gap for currency paper in India and herald the start of the  process which will eventually make India completely self reliant in all the  security inputs required for manufacture of currency notes. Indigenisation of  banknote paper manufacturing will provide the benefits of backward integration  in the form of assured, smooth and timely supplies, cost savings, employment  generation, and an effective deterrent to counterfeiting. Hence, this project is of  great strategic significance and we must remain resolutely committed to its  success.    9. The effort at indigenization should be carried to its logical end and  subsume security features and ink as well. I have been told that modest  capacity exists within SPMCIL for manufacturing of security intaglio ink. This  capacity should be augmented and self-sufficiency in ink production needs to be  targeted.    10.  The security features being used in bank notes are technologically  advanced and developed products, a result of large investments, over long  periods of time, in research and development (R&D). These products are  procured from specialist suppliers through customized exclusivity agreements,  which protect the interests of the procuring country. At present, our capacities in  this area are minimal. However, looking forward, with the objective of complete  indigenisation, it is imperative to create a state of the art R & D institution. This  institution shall, on a continual basis, keep pace with the innovations happening  in this field, and incubate capacities  either in the existing institutions of higher  research and learning, or, through Greenfield ventures  in this significant area.   11. I have been informed that significant potential for development of  indigenous technologies exists in other related areas as well, such as plated  coins, machinery and related software.    12. Looking to the importance of ensuring self sufficiency in all aspects of  security products, I have constituted a high level review committee, one of the  terms of reference of which is to suggest a roadmap for progressive  indigenization of various inputs, including high end machinery and security  features. I am keenly awaiting the recommendations of this committee, after  which, I plan to develop a roadmap for indigenization, in consultation with the  RBI, which will enable us to meet the requirements of security inputs, ensure  integrity of our currency and effectively thwart menace of counterfeiting.    13. I understand that a detailed timeline has been formulated for  implementing this project. It would be important to adhere to the milestones and  I look forward to the successful and timely completion of the project. I urge the  Ministry of Finance and the RBI to monitor implementation of this important  endeavour at periodic intervals, to ensure that the project is completed in time  bound manner. I may also be kept informed in case of any issues that require  intervention at my level.    14. I once again congratulate all of you on this occasion and hope that this  landmark Project will achieve its goals and serve the nation's best interests.
