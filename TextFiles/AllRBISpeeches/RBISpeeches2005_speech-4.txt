Taking Banking Services to the Common Man –Financial Inclusion *Ladies and Gentlemen,I am truly honoured to deliver the Fedbank Hormis Memorial Foundationcommemorative lecture. The illustrious list of the previous years’ speakersindicates the kind of significance this commemorative lecture has acquired over theyears. The late Shri K.P.Hormis, founder of Federal Bank, was a visionary and leftbehind an institutional set up in the form of Federal Bank which has been doingyeoman service for well over seventy five years. The Fedbank Hormis MemorialFoundation, a public charitable trust, has been furthering the cause of banking andfinance by providing knowledge and training in the areas of banking, finance,economics and management to banking professionals as well as deservingstudents who are specializing in these areas. As the life and times of late ShriK.P.Hormis were spent largely in taking banking to the masses, which is indicatedby Federal Bank’s mix of urban and rural coverage, I thought it would beappropriate for me to speak on taking banking services to the common man –financial inclusion, a topic of contemporary significance and relevance.The banking industry has shown tremendous growth in volume and complexityduring the last few decades. Despite making significant improvements in all theareas relating to financial viability, profitability and competitiveness, there areconcerns that banks have not been able to include vast segment of the population,especially the underprivileged sections of the society, into the fold of basic bankingservices. Internationally also efforts are being made to study the causes offinancial exclusion and designing strategies to ensure financial inclusion of thepoor and disadvantaged. The reasons may vary from country to country and hencethe strategy could also vary but all out efforts are being made as financial inclusioncan truly lift the financial condition and standards of life of the poor and thedisadvantaged.______________________________* Commemorative Lecture by Shri V.Leeladhar, Deputy Governor Reserve bank of India atthe Fedbank Hormis Memorial Foundation at Ernakulam on December 2, 20053. What is Financial Inclusion?• Financial inclusion is delivery of banking services at an affordablecost to the vast sections of disadvantaged and low income groups.Unrestrained access to public goods and services is the sine qua nonof an open and efficient society. As banking services are in thenature of public good, it is essential that availability of banking andpayment services to the entire population without discrimination is theprime objective of the public policy.4. The scope of financial inclusionThe scope of financial inclusion can be expanded in two ways.(a) through state-driven intervention by way of statutory enactments ( forinstance the US example, the Community Reinvestment Act and makingit a statutory right to have bank account in France).(b) through voluntary effort by the banking community itself for evolvingvarious strategies to bring within the ambit of the banking sector thelarge strata of society.When bankers do not give the desired attention to certain areas, the regulatorshave to step in to remedy the situation. This is the reason why the Reserve Bank ofIndia is placing a lot of emphasis on financial inclusion.In India the focus of the financial inclusion at present is confined to ensuring a bareminimum access to a savings bank account without frills, to all. Internationally, thefinancial exclusion has been viewed in a much wider perspective. Having a currentaccount / savings account on its own, is not regarded as an accurate indicator offinancial inclusion. There could be multiple levels of financial inclusion andexclusion. At one extreme, it is possible to identify the ‘super-included’, i.e., thosecustomers who are actively and persistently courted by the financial servicesindustry, and who have at their disposal a wide range of financial services andproducts. At the other extreme, we may have the financially excluded, who aredenied access to even the most basic of financial products. In between are thosewho use the banking services only for deposits and withdrawals of money. Butthese persons may have only restricted access to the financial system, and maynot enjoy the flexibility of access offered to more affluent customers.5. Consequences of Financial ExclusionConsequences of financial exclusion will vary depending on the nature and extentof services denied. It may lead to increased travel requirements, higher incidenceof crime, general decline in investment, difficulties in gaining access to credit orgetting credit from informal sources at exorbitant rates, and increasedunemployment, etc.  The small business may suffer due to loss of access to middleclass and higher-income consumers, higher cash handling costs, delays inremittances of money.  According to certain researches, financial exclusion canlead to social exclusion.6. International experience in promoting financial inclusionAn interesting feature which emerges from the international practice is that themore developed the society is, the greater the thrust on empowerment of thecommon person and low income groups. It may be worthwhile to have a look at theinternational experience in tackling the problem of financial exclusion so that wecan learn from the international experience.The Financial Inclusion Task Force in UK has identified three priority areas for thepurpose of financial inclusion,  viz., access to banking, access to affordable creditand access to free face-to-face money advice. UK has established a FinancialInclusion Fund to promote financial inclusion and assigned responsibility to banksand credit unions in removing financial exclusion. Basic bank no frills accountshave been introduced. An enhanced legislative environment for credit unions hasbeen established, accompanied by tighter regulations to ensure greater protectionfor investors. A Post Office Card Account (POCA) has been created for thosewho are unable or unwilling to access a basic bank account. The concept of aSavings Gateway has been piloted. This offers those on low-income employment£1 from the state for every £1 they invest, up to a maximum of £25 per month. Inaddition the Community Finance Learning Initiatives (CFLIs) were alsointroduced with a view to promoting basic financial literacy among housingassociation tenants.A civil rights law, namely Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in the United Statesprohibits discrimination by banks against low and moderate incomeneighborhoods. The CRA imposes an affirmative and continuing obligations onbanks to serve the needs for credit and banking services of all the communities inwhich they are chartered.  In fact, numerous studies conducted by FederalReserve and Harvard University demonstrated that CRA lending is a win-winproposition and profitable to banks. In this context, it is also interesting to know theother initiative taken by a state in the United States. Apart from the CRAexperiment, armed with the sanction of Banking Law, the State of New YorkBanking Department, with the objective of making available the low cost bankingservices to consumers, made mandatory that each banking institution shall offerbasic banking account and in case of credit unions the basic share draft account,which is in the nature of low cost account with minimum facilities.  Some keyfeatures of the basic banking account are worth-mentioning here.• the initial deposit amount required to open the account shall notexceed US $ 25• the minimum balance, including any average balance, required tomaintain such account shall not exceed US $ 0.10• the charge for periodic cycle for the maintenance of such accounts to bedeclared up front• the minimum number of withdrawal transactions which may be madeduring any periodic cycle at no charge to the account holder must at leastbe eight• a withdrawal shall be deemed to be made when recorded on thebooks of the account holder’s banking institution• except, as provided below, an account holder shall not be restricted as to the number of deposits which may be made to theaccount without incurring any additional charge• the banking institution may charge account holders for transactions atelectronic facilities which are not operated by the account holder’s bankinginstitution as well as other fees and charges for specific banking serviceswhich are not covered under the basic banking account scheme• every periodic statement issued for the basic banking account shouldinvariably cover on it or by way of separate communiqué maximumnumber of withdrawals permitted during each periodic cycle withoutadditional charge and the consequences of exceeding such maximum andthe fee if any, for the use of electronic facilities which are not operated by the account holder’s banking institution.An interesting feature of basic banking account scheme is the element oftransparency i.e. the banking institution should, prior to opening the account,furnish a written disclosure to the account holder describing the main features ofthe scheme i.e. the initial deposit amount required to open the account, minimumbalance to be maintained, charge per periodic cycle for use of such account,maximum number of withdrawal transactions without any additional charge andother charges imposed on transactions for availing electronic facility not operatedby the account holder’s banking institution, etc.7. Indian ScenarioBank nationalization in India marked a paradigm shift in the focus of banking as itwas intended to shift the focus from class banking to mass banking. The rationalefor creating Regional Rural Banks was also to take the banking services to poorpeople.  The branches of commercial banks and the RRBs have increased from8321 in the year 1969 to 68,282 branches as at the end of March 2005. Theaverage population per branch office has decreased from 64,000 to 16,000 duringthe same period. However, there are certain under-banked states such as Bihar,Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and alarge number of North-Eastern states, where the average population per branchoffice continues to be quite high compared to the national average. As you wouldbe aware, the new branch authorization policy of Reserve Bank encourages banksto open branches in these under banked states and the under banked areas inother states. The new policy also places a lot of emphasis on the efforts made bythe Bank to achieve, inter alia, financial inclusion and other policy objectives.One of the benchmarks employed to assess the degree of reach of financialservices to the population of the country, is the quantum of deposit accounts(current and savings) held as a ratio to the adult population. In the Indian context,taking into account the Census of 2001 (ignoring the incremental growth ofpopulation thereafter), the ratio of deposit accounts (data available as on March31, 2004) to the total adult population was only 59% (details furnished in the table).Within the country, there is a wide variation  across states. For instance, the ratiofor the state of Kerala is as high as 89% while Bihar is marked by a low coverageof 33%. In the North Eastern States like Nagaland and Manipur, the coverage wasa meager 21% and 27%, respectively.  The Northern Region, comprising the statesof Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, has a high coverage ratio of 84%. Compared tothe developed world, the coverage of our financial services is quite low. Forinstance, as per a recent survey commissioned by British Bankers' Association, 92to 94% of the population of UK has either current or savings bank account.8. Steps towards financial inclusionIn the context of initiatives taken for extending banking services to the small man,the mode of financial sector development until 1980’s was characterized by• a hugely expanded bank branch and cooperative network and neworganizational forms like RRBs;• a greater focus on credit rather than other financial services likesavings and insurance, although the banks and cooperatives didprovide deposit facilities;• lending targets directed at a range of ‘priority sectors’ such asagriculture, weaker sections of the population, etc;• interest rate ceilings;• significant government subsidies channeled through the banks andcooperatives, as well as through related government programmes;• a dominant perspective that finance for rural and poor people was asocial obligation and not a potential business opportunity.It is absolutely beyond any doubt that the financial access to masses hassignificantly improved in the last three and a half decades. But the basic questionis, has that been good enough. As I mentioned earlier, the quantum of depositaccounts (current and savings) held as a ratio to the adult population has not beenuniformly encouraging. There is a tremendous scope for financial coverage if wehave to improve the standards of life of those deprived people.With a view to enhancing the financial inclusion, as a proactive measure, the  RBIin its Annual Policy Statement for the year 2005-06, while recognizing the concernsin regard to the banking practices that tend to exclude rather than attract vastsections of population, urged banks to review their existing practices to align themwith the objective of financial inclusion. In the Mid Term Review of the Policy(2005-06),  RBI exhorted the banks, with a view to achieving greater financialinclusion, to make available a basic banking  ‘no frills’ account either with nil orvery minimum balances as well as charges that would make such accountsaccessible to vast sections of the population. The nature and number oftransactions in such accounts would be restricted and made known to customers inadvance in a transparent manner. All banks are urged to give wide publicity to thefacility of such no frills account so as to ensure greater financial inclusion.Further, in order to ensure that persons belonging to low income group both inurban and rural areas do not face difficulty in opening the bank accounts due to theprocedural hassles, the KYC procedure for opening accounts has been simplifiedfor those persons who intend to keep balances not exceeding rupees fifty thousand(Rs. 50,000/-) in all their accounts taken together and the total credit in all theaccounts taken together is not expected to exceed rupees one lakh (Rs.1,00,000/-)in a year.9. The Way ForwardThe banks should come out of inhibited feeling that very aggressive competitionpolicy and social inclusion are mutually exclusive. As demonstrated elsewhere,the mass banking with no-frills etc. can become a win-win situation for both.Basically banking services need to be “marketed” to connect with largepopulation segments and these may be justifiable promotional costs. Theopportunities are plenty.• In the context of India becoming one of the largest micro finance markets inthe world especially in the growth of women’s savings and credit groups(SHGs) and the sustaining success of such institutions which has beendemonstrated by the success of SEWA bank in Gujarat, low cost banking isnot necessarily an unviable venture/proposition.• The IBA may explore the possibility of a survey about the coverage inrespect of financial inclusion keeping in view the geographical spread of thebanks and extent of financial services available to the population so as toassess the constraints in extension of financial services to hithertounbanked sections and for initiating appropriate policy measures.• It may be useful for banks to consider franchising with other segments offinancial sector such as cooperatives, RRBs etc. so as to extend the scopeof financial inclusion with minimal intermediation cost.• Since large sections of low income groups transactions are related todeposits and withdrawals, with a view to containing transaction costs,'simple to use' cash dispensing and collecting machines akin to ATMs, withoperating instructions and commands in vernacular would greatly facilitatefinancial inclusion of the semi urban and rural populace. In this regard, it isworthwhile to emulate the example of ‘e-Choupal’ project brought forththrough private sector initiative.ConclusionIt is becoming increasingly apparent that addressing financial exclusion will requirea holistic approach on the part of the banks in creating awareness about financialproducts, education, and advice on money management, debt counseling, savingsand affordable credit. The banks would have to evolve specific strategies toexpand the outreach of their services in order to promote financial inclusion. Oneof the ways in which this can be achieved in a cost-effective manner is throughforging linkages with microfinance institutions and local communities. Banks shouldgive wide publicity to the facility of no frills account. Technology can be a veryvaluable tool in providing access to banking products in remote areas. ATMs cashdispensing machines can be modified suitably to make them user friendly forpeople who are illiterate, less educated or do not know English.To sum up, banks need to redesign their business strategies to incorporate specificplans to promote financial inclusion of low income group treating it both a businessopportunity as well as a corporate social responsibility. They have to make use ofall available resources including technology and expertise available with them aswell as the MFIs and NGOs. It may appear in the first instance that  taking bankingto the sections constituting “the bottom of the pyramid”, may not be profitable but itshould always be remembered that even the relatively low margins on highvolumes can be a very profitable proposition. Financial inclusion can emerge ascommercial profitable business. Only the banks should be prepared to thinkoutside the box!Coverage of Banking Services (Ratio of Demand Deposit Accounts to the adultpopulation)No. of No. ofacc. acc.Adult Per PerPopulatio Total No. 100 of 100 ofRegion/State/Union Current Savings Total n (Above Of popula adultTerritory Accounts Accounts Population 19 years) accounts tion pop.NORTHERNREGION 4215701 52416125 132676462 67822312 56631826 43 84Haryana 572660 8031472 21082989 11308025 8604132 41 76Himachal Pradesh 134285 2433595 6077248 3566886 2567880 42 72Jammu & Kashmir 277529 3094790 10069917 5379594 3372319 33 63Punjab 1156137 13742201 24289296 14185190 14898338 61 105Rajasthan 689657 12139302 56473122 28473743 12828959 23 45Chandigarh 80607 1126696 900914 546171 1207303 134 221Delhi 1304826 11848069 13782976 7929589 13152895 95 166NORTH-EASTERNREGION 476603 6891081 38495089 19708982 7367684 19 37Arunachal Pradesh 10538 209073 1091117 544582 219611 20 40Assam 378729 5071058 26638407 14074393 5449787 20 39Manipur 12514 200593 2388634 1222107 213107 9 17Meghalaya 24305 458779 2306069 1088165 483084 21 44Mizoram 3441 117885 891058 476205 121326 14 25Nagaland 13819 195452 1988636 995523 209271 11 21Tripura 33257 638241 3191168 1784212 671498 21 38EASTERN REGION 1814219 47876140 227613073 122136133 49690359 22 41Bihar 464511 13225242 82878796 40934170 13689753 17 33Jharkhand 166007 5834341 26909428 13737485 6000348 22 44Orissa 228160 7030004 36706920 21065404 7258164 20 34Sikkim 4097 125365 540493 288500 129462 24 45West Bengal 942733 21544753 80221171 45896914 22487486 28 49Andaman & NicobarIslands 8711 116435 356265 213660 125146 35 59CENTRAL REGION 2202217 64254189 255713495 129316677 66456406 26 51Chhattisgarh 192067 3346898 20795956 11209425 3538965 17 32Madhya Pradesh 553381 11731918 60385118 31404990 12285299 20 39Uttar Pradesh 1324509 45804350 166052859 82229748 47128859 28 57Uttaranchal 132260 3371023 8479562 4472514 3503283 41 78WESTERN REGION 3178102 49525101 149071747 86182206 52703203 35 61Goa 81551 1584177 1343998 891411 1665728 124 187Gujarat 955964 16220262 50596992 28863095 17176226 34 60Maharashtra 2127240 31568184 96752247 56207604 33695424 35 60Dadra & NagarHaveli 6076 69308 220451 122765 75384 34 61Daman & Diu 7271 83170 158059 97331 90441 57 93SOUTHERNREGION 4666014 83386898 223445381 135574225 88052912 39 65Andhra Pradesh 1156405 23974580 75727541 44231918 25130985 33 57Karnataka 1086662 19147819 52733958 30623289 20234481 38 66Kerala 600065 17669723 31838619 20560323 18269788 57 89Tamil Nadu 1786514 22052812 62110839 39511038 23839326 38 60Lakshadweep 491 22997 60595 33686 23488 39 70Pondicherry 35877 518967 973829 613971 554844 57 90ALL-INDIA 16552856 304349534 1027015247 541031553 320902390 31 59
