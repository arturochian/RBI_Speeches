32 ACU Board Meeting –
Governor’s Welcome Address on June 16, 2003
Honourable Governors and distinguished Delegates, Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:
nd
It is a great privilege for me to welcome you to this 32 Board meeting of the Asian Clearing
Union (ACU). I am happy that this meeting is being held in the city of Bangalore, known as the
‘City of Gardens’ , with a great tradition in music, literature, architecture, science and technology.
The city is now known even more as India’s leading city for information technology.
2.  Before proceeding further, I should mention with immense grief that Dr. Mohsen Nourbaksh,
the Governor of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is no more with us. He was one
of the finest and leading personalities of the ACU fraternity. I request this House to stand in
silence and  pay our humble respect to the memory of Dr. Nourbaksh.
3.  The ACU Board meeting is being held in India after a gap of seven years – the previous one
was held in May 1996 at Mumbai. I am sure that this meeting, as was the case with all the earlier
occasions, will also prove to be a fruitful one and would be an important landmark in the
consolidation and further strengthening of the ACU.
4.   The Asian Clearing Union (ACU), which started functioning in November 1975, has completed
27 years of successful operations. It has proved to be a strong and purposeful regional
arrangement benefiting its members by optimizing the use of their foreign exchange resources.
From a humble beginning of trade worth USD 51.4 million during the first year of its operations,
the Union has grown into a reasonably powerful entity for regional co-operation in Asia.  During
the year 2002 it clocked a turnover of almost USD 7 billion.
Benefits of ACU
5.   We may recall that ACU was formed at a time when the countries in the region were facing
acute shortage of foreign exchange and, therefore, had stringent exchange controls.  The Union
provided the member countries with the twin advantages of economizing on the use of foreign
exchange and also availing of short term credits during the period of the settlement cycle.  In the
process, the governments of the member countries, their monetary authorities and central banks
have established close and purposeful relationships.  Further, the bankers and traders in the
member countries benefited from lower transaction costs.  The ACU has established a creditable
settlement record in that there has been no default at all since the Union started functioning.
6.  A significant contributory factor for the success of the ACU was the switching over of the
union’s accounting unit from AMU (Asian Monetary Unit) to the ACU dollar.  Under the current

    Board Meeting
system, in vogue since 1996, traders are being allowed not only to invoice their documents in
US dollars but also to make and receive payments in dollars.  Commercial banks in member
countries are allowed to open nostro accounts in ACU dollars to facilitate all receipts and
payments.  Further the central banks are arranging to fund as well as absorb excess liquidity
from these accounts.
7.   The switchover has facilitated the application of real time rates and up-gradation of the entire
ACU mechanism to be in tune with the rapid changes in the international forex markets due to
the revolutionary changes in satellite communications and wide ranging financial sector
liberalization in the developing economies.  As a result, the transactions are now being settled
expeditiously and in true reflection of the market value of the currencies of member countries.
8.    Further, the switchover to ACU dollar for accounting of all the transactions of the Union has
facilitated market participants in member countries to get forward cover for their transactions and
also made them eligible to get pre-shipment and post-shipment credit denominated in foreign
currencies.
9.  It is heartening to note that India has been playing a key role in the success of the ACU
mechanism, topping the turnover table year after year.  Its share in the volume of transactions
has been around 40% followed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and Bangladesh at 23 per cent
and 17 per cent respectively on an average, during the last three years.
10. In the last Board meeting my distinguished colleague from Sri Lanka, Governor
Jayawardena rightly described ACU as the oldest institution for regional co-operation in Asia.
Having been set up at a time of severe shortage of foreign exchange and having served the
member countries well, the Union has reached a stage where there is a need to evaluate the
future role of the ACU to adjust to new realities.  In this context, Governor Jayawardena had
suggested that the terms of reference of the ACU needs to be revisited, and I am glad that a
technical team with the help of ESCAP has gone into this aspect.
Future role of ACU
11. For the evolution of ACU in the coming years the recommendations of the Technical
Committee, which examined `The Future role of ACU’ and related issues are important.  The
Committee felt that the Union should continue in its present form and should continue to focus
on the facility to settle, on a multilateral basis, payments for current international transactions
and thus economise on the use of foreign exchange reserves.  It has, however, highlighted that
the ACU mechanism needs to demonstrate the tangible benefits it could provide to its members.

On the expansion of ACU, the Committee has pointed out that neighbouring countries would join
the mechanism only if they are convinced of the benefits they could derive from the membership.
It is, therefore, necessary to make the ACU mechanism more efficient in the first instance and
enhance the volume of trade routed through the arrangement.  In this context, the Committee
has noted that administrative bottlenecks have been hampering the progress of use of the
mechanism to some extent.  If ACU mechanism has to become popular, these bottlenecks have
to be removed.
12.   Keeping the need of efficient telecommunication facilities among member countries in view,
the Committee has also recommended that all the member countries could introduce SWIFT
system for transmitting messages to facilitate faster settlement of transactions especially in view
of the fact that use of telex is being discontinued by most countries.  Introduction of the Real
Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), although expensive, could be thought of as a medium
term objective by member countries.
13.  Apart from improving upon the existing operational mechanism of ACU to enhance
efficiency of the Union it could now be used as a forum for free exchange of views among the
members.  The Union could become a strong and non-political forum of central banks in the
region to discuss issues relating to economic co-operation among member countries within the
ACU mechanism on the one hand, and other areas like exchange rate management and foreign
exchange reserve management with a view to evolving appropriate approaches to resolving
technical issues on the other.  The forum could also facilitate exchange of experiences on
developments taking place in the respective economies, problems faced by individual member
countries etc.  The Board may like to deliberate on the details of the recommendations of the
Technical Committee when its Report is presented, later during the day.
Other issues
14. Besides the issues concerning the ACU mechanism which I have just mentioned, perhaps
this august gathering can deliberate on other issues like the overall economic development of
the region.  The global economy is clouded by uncertainties.  The major economies of the world
are plagued by sluggish growth and are searching for ways to improve their performance.
Compared to the industrialized nations, developing countries are faring better.  Within the ACU,
most of the member countries recorded annual growths in excess of 4% during 2000-2001.  This
augurs well for the ACU.  However, there is need for better volumes of trade amongst the
member countries so that the system of ACU could be utilized to the full extent for the maximum
benefit of each of them.

15.  There is need for further efforts at increasing economic co-operation among members and
closer relationships among the banking systems of the countries.  In the scenario of fast
emerging developments, prompted by technology and deeper integration of global markets, it is
imperative that ACU members should continuously update themselves technologically and be
quick in adopting new and more efficient methods of operations.  As recommended by the
Technical Committee, members who are yet to switch over to SWIFT, should do so
expeditiously, in order to enable ACU to aim for and achieve `real time’ settlements as soon as
possible.
16.  There is also a strong need to expand the membership.  Besides Maldives, the possibilities
of bringing in Thailand, China, Malaysia and countries like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and others
should be explored.  The expanded membership will help in better utilization of this important
mechanism for the benefit of all the members.
17.  It is in this context that we have invited Thailand to attend this meeting.  I extend a warm
welcome to the representatives from the Bank of Thailand.  After this meeting, they will be
visiting our office in Mumbai to study in detail the working of the ACU mechanism and its utility
for the member countries.  I earnestly hope that they will be convinced about the benefits of
membership of the ACU.
18.  Before I conclude, on your behalf and mine, I would like to pay a special tribute to the
contribution of Dr. Mohammad Firouzdor, Secretary General, to the work of ACU.  I have been
informed that he proposes to retire from his position next week.  As you are aware he has been
the guiding spirit behind the ACU Secretariat for the last six years.  Through his excellent efforts,
among many other matters, Dr. Firouzdor has ensured that the switchover to ACU clearing
mechanism is smooth and efficient. He was also instrumental in bringing the settlement
mechanism to best international standards.  All of us are grateful to him for the valuable
contribution he has made to the success of ACU and wish him a healthy and happy retired life.
19.  A successor to Dr. Firouzdor would also need to be elected at this meeting.  I propose we
take up this item under our last agenda on `any other business’.
20.  We earnestly hope that your stay during this Board Meeting will be comfortable and
enjoyable.  Once again, let me say how happy I personally, and the Reserve Bank are to
welcome you to our country and to the City of Bangalore.
Thank you,
