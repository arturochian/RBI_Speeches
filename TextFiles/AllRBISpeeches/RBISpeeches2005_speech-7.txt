Corporate Governance in the Financial SectorI am happy to be here today at the annual seminar of insurance regulators andfeel fortunate to share the platform with a very distinguished international expertDr. YRK Reddy of the Academy of Corporate Governance.Keeping in view the discussions on corporate governance scheduled at theseminar I intend to give a brief overview of the role and importance of corporategovernance in the banking sector, initiatives undertaken by RBI and then a flag afew generic issues relating to corporate governance based on our experiencewith the banking sector. Though the ‘deposit accepting’ feature of banks setsthem apart from other financial intermediaries, the basic elements of governancein any public institution can be said to be sector independent. Moreover althoughobjectives of banking sector regulators may be slightly different from those ofinsurance regulators there are a number of commonalities and in some countriesbanking and insurance regulation is in one institution. I therefore, hope that thisinteraction would be found useful by the participants.Corporate Governance and banksAlthough globalisation of financial markets necessitates some basic internationalstandards of corporate governance for financial institutions, it is also recognizedthat such uniform international standards may result in different levels ofsystemic risk for different jurisdictions because of differences in businesscustoms and practices and institutional and legal structures of national markets.Each country will therefore need domestic regulations that prescribe specificrules and procedures for the governance of financial institutions that addressnational differences in political economic and legal systems while adoptinginternational standards and principles.Banks are “special” as they not only accept and deploy large amount ofuncollateralized public funds in fiduciary capacity, but they also leverage suchfunds through credit creation. The role of banks is integral to any economy. Theyprovide financing for commercial enterprises access to payment systems and avariety of retail financial services for the economy at large. The integral role thatbanks play in the national economy is demonstrated by the almost universalpractice of states in regulating the banking industry and providing in many casesa government safety net to compensate depositors when banks fail. The largenumber of stakeholders whose economic well being depends on the health of thebanking system depend on implementation of appropriate regulatory practicesand supervision. Indeed in a healthy banking system the regulators andsupervisors themselves are stakeholders acting on behalf of society at large.  Asregulators we do not act on behalf of shareholders or individual customers but onbehalf of groups such as depositors policyholders or pension fund members whorely on the continued solvency of regulated institutions for their financial securitybut who are themselves not well placed to assess financial soundness.Banks unlike insurance companies are highly leveraged entities and assetliability mismatches are an inherent feature of their business. Consequently, theyface a wide range of risks in their day-to-day operations. Any mismanagement ofrisks by these entities can have very serious and drastic consequences on astand alone basis which might pose a serious threat for financial stability. Thisdimension further strengthens our premise that effective risk managementsystems are essential for financial institutions and emphasises the need for theseto be managed with great responsibility and maturity. Good corporategovernance, therefore, is fundamental to achieve this objective.Governance – Principal Agent problemThe main characteristics of any governance problem are that the opportunityexists for some managers to improve their economic payoffs by engaging inunobserved socially costly behaviour or abuse and the inferior information set ofthe outside monitors relative to the firm. There is a wide range of potentialagency problems in financial institutions involving several major stakeholdergroups including but not limited to depositors owners creditors management andsupervisory bodies. Agency problems arise because responsibility for decisionmaking is directly or indirectly delegated from one stakeholder group to anotherin situations where objectives between different stakeholder groups differ andwhere complete information which would allow for further control to be exertedover the decision maker is not readily available. Primarily there are three groupswhich can monitor the management of banks: owner, market and supervisors.The oversight by the Board is an important part of governance in banks. Inaddition oversight by non-executives who are not involved in day to daymanagement is also important, direct line supervision in different areas andindependent risk management and audit functions also form part of theorganizational structure of any bank which ensures proper governance.Initiatives taken by RBIThe importance attached to corporate governance in banks is reflected in the factthat the Reserve Bank had constituted at least three committees/ working groupsto assess and make appropriate recommendations. These are:• A Standing Committee on International Financial Standards and Codeswas constituted to, inter alia, assess the status in India vis-à-vis thebest global practices in regard to standards and codes. An AdvisoryGroup on Corporate Governance (Chairman: Dr. R. H. Patil) madedetailed assessment and gave recommendations of which thoserelating to PSBs is an important component.• The Advisory Group on Banking Supervision (Chairman : Mr. M.S.Verma) has also made some recommendations on corporategovernance.• A Consultative Group of Directors of banks and financial institutions(Chairman Dr. A.S. Ganguly) was constituted to review the supervisoryrole of Boards of banks and financial institutions and to obtainfeedback on the functioning of the Boards vis-à-vis compliance,transparency, disclosures, audit committees etc. and makerecommendations for making the role of Board of Directors moreeffective.The Groups made their recommendations after a comprehensive review of theexisting framework as well as of current practices and benchmarked therecommendations with international best practices as enunciated by the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision, as well as of other committees and advisorybodies, to the extent applicable in the Indian environment. The Groups made farreaching proposals to improve corporate governance and many, if not all, dorequire legislative processes and they are necessarily time consuming and oftenrealizable only in medium-term.  While proceeding with analysis and possiblelegislative actions, changes that could be brought about within the existinglegislative framework have been implemented.The issue of corporate governance in banks, like any organization,  needs to beaddressed in regard to (i) quality and concentration of ownership; (ii) quality ofManagement (iii) prudential framework and (ii)  the mechanism for effectiveoversight of Board of Directors.I. Quality and concentration of ownershipThe ownership issue in banks straddles a few crucial issues that have beenengaging our attention and a policy environment is being sought to be createdthat would confirm to the best principles of governance. Unique corporategovernance challenges are posed where the ownership structure lackstransparency or where there insufficient checks and balances on inappropriateinfluences of controlling shareholders. While there can be different views on theissue of concentrated ownership there is clearly a recognition that significantshareholders should pass the fitness and propriety tests.The current legal and policy framework with respect to ownership in banks, at asectoral level, entails the following :(i) Voting rights restriction as per banking lawsIn terms of the statutory provisions under the various banking acts, the votingrights, when exercised, have been stipulated as under:Private Sector Banks – No person holding shares, in respect of any[Section 12(2) of Banking share held by him, shall exercise voting rights onRegulation Act,1949] poll in excess of ten percent of the total votingrights of all the shareholders.Nationalised Banks – [Section No shareholder, other than the Central3(2E) of Banking Companies Government, shall be entitled to exercise voting(Acquisition and Transfer of rights in respect of any shares held by him inUndertakings) Acts, 1970/80] excess of one percent of the total voting rights ofall the shareholders of the nationalised bank.State Bank of India (SBI) - No shareholder, other than RBI, shall be entitled(Section 11 of State Bank of to exercise voting rights in excess of ten percentIndia Act,1955) of the issued capital, (Government, inconsultation with RBI can raise the above votingright to more than ten percent).SBI Associates - [Section No person shall be registered as a shareholder19(1) and (2) of SBI in respect of any shares held by him in excess of(Subsidiary Bank) Act, 1959] two hundred shares.No shareholder, other than SBI, shall be entitledto exercise voting rights in excess of one percentof the issued capital of the subsidiary bankconcerned.(ii) Acknowledgement of RBI for transfer of shares more than 5% In respect of private sector banks, RBI had issued guidelines in September1999, revised in February 2004, on the grant of acknowledgement foracquisition and transfer of shares. In terms of these, acknowledgement fromRBI for acquisition/transfer of shares is required for all cases of acquisition ofshares which will take the aggregate holding (direct and indirect, beneficial orotherwise) of an individual or group to equivalent of 5 percent or more of thepaid-up capital of the bank. For higher thresholds, 10% and 30%, increasinglystricter criteria would be adopted for considering granting ofacknowledgements.(iii) Restrictions on cross holdings: a bank's aggregate investment in thefollowing instruments issued by other banks and financial institutions ispermitted up to 10 per cent of the investing bank's capital funds (Tier I plusTier II capitala.  Equity shares;b.  Preference shares eligible for capital status;c.  Subordinated debt instruments;d.  Hybrid debt capital instruments; ande.  Any other instrument approved as in the nature of capital.Further, banks’ / FIs’ investments in the equity capital of subsidiaries are atpresent deducted from their Tier I capital for capital adequacy purposes.II. Board of DirectorsThe framework in respect of ensuring effective oversight by the Board ofDirectors incorporates the following:(i) Statutory requirement regarding composition of Board of Directors(ii)  BOD establishes strategic objectives and a set of corporate values thatare communicated throughout the banking organisation.(iii) BOD have an obligation to understand the risk profile of the institutionand ensure adequate capital to cover the risk(iv) Unique challenge when the institutions have complex corporatestructures. Where a bank is part of a wider group either as parent orsubsidiary a number of of issues arise from the corporate governanceperspective in that it is likely to affect to a certain extent structure andactivities of both parent and subsidiary boards. Need for effective controlof subsidiaries by the parent board.(v) Excessive outsourcing of intragroup activities also causes concernsfrom the supervisors point of view.(vi) Group dimension also creates conflict of interest within the Group whichhave to be managed.(vii) Guidelines regarding criteria for appointment of directors, role andresponsibilities of directors and the Board(viii)   Covenants & undertaking: A declaration and undertaking is required tobe obtained from the proposed / existing directors. The directors arerequired to execute a covenant binding them to discharge theirresponsibilities to the best of their abilities, individually and collectively.Further, the issue related to the broader issue of fit and proper status ofdirectors and signing of the covenants should be one of the criteria to beeligible to be a director of a bank. The board of the bank must ensure inpublic interest that the nominated / elected directors execute the deedsof covenants as recommended by Dr. Ganguly Group.(ix)  Training / Seminars: The banks have been advised to ensure that thedirectors are exposed to the latest managerial techniques, technologicaldevelopments in banks, and financial markets, risk managementsystems etc. so  as to discharge their duties to the best of their abilities.While RBI can offer certain training programmes/seminars in this regardat its training establishments, large banks may conduct suchprogrammes in  their own training  centres.(x)  Audit committee of the Board In 1995, the RBI directed banks to set upAudit Committees of their Boards, with the responsibility of ensuringefficacy of the internal control and audit functions in the bank besidescompliance with the inspection report of the RBI, internal and concurrentauditors.  To ensure both professionalism and independence, theChartered Accountant Directors on the boards of banks are mandatorymembers, but the Chairman would not be part of the Audit Committee.Apart from the above, Board level committees that are required to be setup are Risk Management committee, Asset Liability Managementcommittee (ALCO), etc. The Boards have also been given the freedomto constitute any other committees, to render advice to it.(xi)  Sound practices for CR, MR and OR management emphasizing role ofBoard & Senior management: As the primary responsibility of layingdown risk parameters and establishing an integrated risk managementand control system rests with the Board of Directors, the banks wereadvised that all assessments of the risk management systems shouldbe placed before the Board. On the basis of such evaluation banksshould initiate appropriate steps, with the approval of their Board, toeliminate the gaps in compliance with the risk management guidelinesissued by RBI and ensure that they have efficient and robust riskmanagement systems in place.(xii)  ‘Fit and proper’ assessment in respect of all persons to be appointed onthe Boards of private sector banks,(xiii) The earlier practice of RBI nominating directors on the Boards of allprivate sector banks has yielded place to such nomination in selectprivate sector banks.III. Quality of management1. Senior management consists of a core group of individuals responsible forthe day to day management of the bank –should have necessary skillsand oversee line managers in specific business areas and activitiesconsist with policies and procedures laid down  by the Board.2. Senior Management establishes effective system of internal controls3. Fit and proper norms for CEO and directors were laid down in terms ofcircular dated June 25, 2004. It was mandated that ‘On appointment ofDirectors, due diligence of the directors of all banks – be they in public orprivate sector, should be done in regard to their suitability for the post byway of qualifications and technical expertise. Involvement of NominationCommittee of the Board in such an exercise should be seriouslyconsidered as a formal process.’4.  Prior approval of Reserve Bank of India for appointment of CEO as wellas terms and conditions thereof.5. Powers for removal of managerial personnel, CEO and directors, etc. inthe interest of depositors. IV         Prudential standardsThe whole principle of capital regulation is that the owners will monitor if theyhave much at stake either in the form of capital or future profits. Hence theemphasis on capital adequacy. Similarly the need for prudential norms onincome recognition and  asset classification and provisioning is required becauseof the nature of bank balance sheets-loan assets do not lend themselves toproper valuation. Appropriate accounting  standards, connected and related partytransaction regulations, risk based supervision enforcement of corporategovernance rules are essential for promoting sound corporate governance. Infact the importance of corporate governance permeates the Core Principles forbanking Supervision against which we assess our practices.Other monitors include PCA framework or structured early intervention approach.However, regulation cannot be a substitute for corporate governance.Transparency as a tool to promote corporate governanceTo accurately evaluate a bank’s disclosures about its financial position andfinancial performance and its risks and risk management strategies, marketparticipants and supervisors need fundamental information about the bank’sbusiness, management and corporate governance. Such information can helpprovide the appropriate perspective and context to understand a bank’s activitiesand help in the effective operation of market discipline which would indirectlyaddress any weaknesses in corporate governance and also encourageenhanced role of corporate governance on the level and quality of disclosures.Thus transparency and good corporate governance can be seen ascomplementary issues – like two sides of the same coin. Certain disclosuresmandated from corporate governance angle are:- Related party transactions: The banks are required to disclose the nameand nature of related party relationship, irrespective of whether there havebeen transactions, where control exists within the meaning of AS 18.Related parties for a bank are its parent, subsidiary(ies), associates/ jointventures, Key Management Personnel (KMP) and relatives of KMP. KMPare the whole time directors for an Indian bank and the chief executiveofficer for a foreign bank having branches in India. Relatives of KMPwould be on the lines indicated in Section 45 S of the R.B.I. Act, 1934.- Segment reporting: For reporting of business information undergeographical and business segments in terms of AS 17, banks arerequired to disclose their ‘domestic’ and ‘international’ operations asgeographical and ‘Treasury’, ‘Other banking operations’ and ‘Residualoperations’ as business segments.- RBI also puts in public domain details of the levy of penalty on a bank forcontraventions of any of the provisions of the Act or non-compliance withany other requirements of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; order, rule orcondition specified by Reserve Bank under the Act.-  While there is no accounting standard in India for disclosure of derivativesbusiness by incorporated entities, RBI has prescribed a minimumframework for disclosures by banks on their risk exposures inderivatives. The disclosure format includes both qualitative andquantitative aspects and has been devised to provide a clear picture of theexposure to risks in derivatives, risk management systems, objectives andpolicies. It broadly included the notional as well as mark to market value ofoutstanding derivative contracts along with the credit equivalents for thesame. The banks are also required discuss their risk management policiespertaining to derivatives with particular reference to the extent to whichderivatives are used, the associated risks and business purposes served.The discussion is expected to include:o the structure and organization for management of risk in derivativestrading,o the scope and nature of risk measurement , risk reporting and riskmonitoring systems,o policies for hedging and / or mitigating risk and strategies andprocesses for monitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges /mitigants, ando accounting policy for recording hedge and non-hedge transactions;recognition of income, premiums and discounts; valuation ofoutstanding contracts; provisioning, collateral and credit riskmitigation.- Apart from the above, in case of listed banks there is added ‘marketoversight’ which subjects them to additional post-listing disclosures.Does compliance with accounting and auditing standards promote bettercorporate governance?The role of sound accounting and adequate disclosure in the creation of usefulinformation for markets and investors is obvious. Sound auditing standardsapplied properly by auditors who also maintain high standards of professionalconduct also contribute to market and investor confidence. In turn, thesedisciplines are also responsive to the changing needs of market, investors andother external stakeholders. Compliance with accounting standards alsocontributes to transparency with regard to certain aspects which are relevant tocorporate governance. Role of rating agencies in CG: The role of rating agencies in influencingcorporate governance has started being appreciated. By providing independentanalyses of the strengths and weaknesses of banks, rating agencies play acritical role in the capital market. To managements and boards, their commentscan be early warning signals which can impel bank strengthening measures.Going forward, rating agencies should focus more on governance risks anddevelop a methodology that explicitly assesses the quality of governance.
