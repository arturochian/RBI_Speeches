Rural Finance: Issues & Challenges1    At the outset, I thank National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development  (NABARD) for inviting me to this esteemed gathering of experts in the field of rural  finance. I am happy that NABARD has organised this National Seminar to mark the  completion of 32 years of its existence. Built upon the legacy of Agricultural Credit  Department of the Reserve Bank of India and the Agriculture Refinance  Development Corporation (ARDC), NABARD today has carved for itself a special  place, especially in the area of rural financing and development. Many of the  innovative financial products and services developed and mainstreamed over the  last three decades for the rural economy can be either directly attributed to the  NABARD or have been positively influenced by the NABARD. I am also happy that  topical issues in the field of rural finance were deliberated upon today as part of this  seminar. I am sure that the seminar has provided a lot of useful insights in the field of  rural finance for all of us and these inputs will help us in informed policy making.     Challenges in developing an inclusive rural financial system    2. Providing financial services in rural areas is a challenge as agriculture and  other rural economic activities have unique characteristics of dependence on natural  resources, long production cycles and vulnerability to multiple risks (all of us  remember the old adage Indian agriculture is a gamble in monsoon). Further, the  sub-division of land and small ticket size of rural non-farm activities require the  provision of small sized loans in large numbers often raising the operational costs for  banks. Moreover, with the widening of the ambit of non-agricultural activities, the  need for non-agricultural rural finance too has gone up considerably. While poorer  groups might need basic savings services and micro-credit to cover production costs  and emergency expenses, farmers and farmers organisations require larger  amounts of credit to finance production, inputs, processing and marketing besides  risk mitigation products, for example, insurance for loss of life and assets. The new  rural finance paradigm needs to be based on the premise that rural people are  bankable and rural clientele is not limited only to the farmers & uneducated but also  includes a generation which can use & adopt technology. It, in turn, advocates a  demand-driven design and efficient provision of multiple financial products and  services through an inclusive financial sector comprising sustainable institutions  serving a diverse rural clientele.    3. Thus, developing an inclusive yet sustainable rural financial system is  extremely challenging and involves comprehensive understanding of host of                                                                1  Based on valedictory address delivered by Shri Harun R Khan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank  of India at the National Seminar on Rural Finance organised by the National Bank for Agriculture  and Rural Development (NABARD) on July 24, 2014 at New Delhi.

Satyajit Dwivedi of NABARD. complementary issues, which I would like to subsume under a broad 7Ps  Framework:    ? Product strategy: For catering to the varied needs of small ticket size  transactions, whether a bouquet of diversified products and services can be  developed without compromising on the flexibility, continuous availability and  convenience of the products? Which types of financial products have the  greatest impact on reducing poverty and lifting growth rates in deprived  districts and regions?  ? Processes: What kinds of business processes can help banks to reach  underserved segments and provide hassle-free near doorstep service to the  customers without jeopardising financial viability? How do we design an  efficient hub & spoke model to overcome the hurdles in the agent led  branchless banking?   ? Partnerships: What are the constraints faced by the underserved and/or  excluded segments in accessing financial services from different types of  service providers? Are the bank - non-bank partnerships, such as, Business  Correspondents, SHGs, MFIs, etc. working efficiently in easing the  accessibility and availability of financial services?  ? Protection: What measures and mechanisms are needed to protect both the  providers and the receivers of rural finance from abuse and misuse of such  services? Whether enough risks mitigants are there for the borrowers given  the higher vulnerability in the sector? Are lenders protected against ebb & flow  of uncertainty in credit culture?  ? Profitability: Whether the business strategies and delivery models are  geared to provide affordable and acceptable services to the rural clientele  while ensuring that rural finance service providers function profitably on a  sustained basis? How do we tap into the customer willingness to pay through  an appropriate pricing model?  ? Productivity: How do we increase the productivity of financial services  provided in the rural areas? What are the strategies needed to synergize  other resources with finance (say, under a credit plus approach) to ensure  more productive and optimal use of financial services?  ? People:  Are the frontline staff of the financial service providers well-equipped  to meet the needs of driving the process of financial inclusion in terms of  knowledge, skill and attitude? Do these people have the capacity,  comprehension and commitment to identify potential customers and offer  them timely advice and comprehensive services?     Many of these are the age-old questions which unfortunately remain pertinent even  today and pose a significant challenge to the policy-makers and regulators. Having  spoken about the challenges, let me outline some of the developments that have  taken place in recent times in rural finance space with specific reference to the three  Page 2 of 12   2011-12  2010-11  2009-10  2008-09  2007-08  2006-07  2005-06  2004-05  2003-04  2002-03  2001-02  sub-themes of this seminar and highlight some of the critical issues related to these  sub-themes.      Capital formation in agriculture and rural infrastructure    Trends in capital formation in agriculture and agricultural credit     4. In any discourse on rural development, agriculture is put on the top of  development agenda and for valid reasons too. Around 50 per cent of population  depends on agriculture for its livelihood. A positive relationship has been found  between agriculture growth and poverty reduction. Also, improved growth in  agriculture tends to trigger rural non-farm activities which can bring down rural  unemployment. Further, there are various forward and backward linkages of  agricultural sector with other sectors of the economy. In the past couple of decades,  a rapid decline in the share of agriculture in GDP, however, has been witnessed  without a commensurate decline in labour force dependent on agriculture. Another  sign of concern has been a deceleration in the growth of gross capital formation  (GCF) in agriculture in real terms in the recent past.  Moreover, GCF in agriculture  has generally grown at a rate slower than the rate of growth in overall GCF over the  last decade, except for a spurt between 2007-08 and 2008-09 (Chart 1).    Chart 1: Growth in Capital Formation in Agriculture  25.0  20.0  15.0  10.0  5.0  0.0  -5.0  Total GCF Ag. GCF  Source: Central Statistics Office (CSO)        5. The elementary growth theory tells us that the growth of a sector depends  upon the investments made in that sector, its capital-output ratio, and the efficiency  of capital in that sector. During much of the period from 1980-81 onwards till 2007- 08, the investment rate in agriculture (GCF as per cent of GDP in agriculture) was  always below 16 per cent. It is only in recent years that this rate has crossed the 16  per cent mark and we have seen some positive results on the agricultural growth  Page 3 of 12    3 year m.a.growth in per cent 2012-13  2012-13  2011-12  2011-12  2010-11  2010-11  2009-10  2009-10  2008-09  2008-09  2007-08  2007-08  2006-07  2006-07  2005-06  2005-06  2004-05  2004-05  2003-04  2003-04  2002-03  2002-03  2001-02  2001-02  2000-01  2000-01  front. In fact, the rate of investment was 22.7 per cent in 2009-10. It has, however,  shown fluctuations thereafter (Chart 2).    Chart 2: Capital formation in agriculture  25.0  20.0  15.0  10.0  5.0  0.0  Ag share in GDP Share of Ag. GCF in Total GCF Share of Ag. GCF in Ag. GDP  Source: Central Statistics Office (CSO)      6. It is interesting to note that in the early 1980s, the share of public and private  investment in agriculture was almost equal, but subsequently the share of public  investment fell drastically. There was an attempt in the early 1990s to increase the  share of public investment, but the impetus did not last long. There was marginal  improvement in this share during 2003-07 but it declined in the subsequent period. In  2012-13, the share of public sector in agriculture amounted to only about 15 per cent  of total GCF (at 2004-05 prices) (Chart 3). So, private sector, the farming community  itself, was a major driver of growth in the agricultural sector. The Union Budget 2014- 15 has rightly recognised the need to revive public investment and has enhanced the  sum allocated towards agriculture investment and warehousing.

Let us now turn to some of the trends in agricultural credit. Tenure-wise  pattern of agricultural credit suggests that the share of long-term credit in total  agricultural credit experienced a secular decline, reaching 37.8 per cent in 2011-12  from 74.3 per cent in 1990-91 (Chart 4). Focus on crop loans with availability of  interest subvention only partially explains this phenomenon. This is a disquieting  trend. It suggests a possible neglect of capital formation in agriculture. Given that  private sector is the major driver of the capital formation and that rate of investment  in agriculture, which presently hovers around 20 per cent need to be sustained and  in fact raised further, there is a need to give immediate attention to long-term  agricultural credit. The issue of sharp decline in project based lendings spearheaded  earlier by the NABARD also needs urgent attention for improving share of long-term  credit. The key thrust areas of such schematic lendings will have to be in areas like  production and marketing of protein foods, vegetables & fruits, organic farming,  supply chain management and farm mechanization.

While capital formation in agriculture directly reflects the investment in  agriculture, rural infrastructure, a much broader concept, refers to all possible  physical and social infrastructure that create a conducive environment for growth in  rural areas. Several studies confirm the positive link between rural infrastructure and  improved livelihoods and productivity and reduced poverty. While almost all rural  infrastructure sectors are under State Governments, Central Government spending  has also been significant in recent years. Overall, the outlay on rural infrastructure  has increased over the years with around ` 3 trillion spent under various heads for  rural infrastructure by the Central Government during the year 2000-12. Out of this,  largest sum went to development of rural roads followed by rural drinking water and  sanitation and rural housing. Irrigation received around 16 per cent of the total rural  infrastructure during this period (Table 1).

Looking at the state of physical infrastructure in rural areas, we see that it has  certainly improved but it still leaves a lot to be desired. It is estimated that rural roads  have connected around 69 per cent of habitations that were planned to be covered  by 2013, but the smaller and more remote ones are yet to be connected. Further, in  2011 almost all villages were connected to the grid, but as much as 45 per cent of  2 rural households still lacked electricity connections . Electricity supply is often  unreliable and water supply is unavailable or polluted.     10. Irrigation is one of the most important inputs for agriculture. Though the  country has made significant strides toward development of irrigation facilities since  independence, more than 50 per cent of the agricultural land is still unirrigated.  Further, huge variations are found across States in terms of the proportion of  irrigated agricultural land. Punjab has an irrigation index of 98 per cent while only 6  per cent of the agricultural land in Jharkhand is irrigated (Chart 5). Further, large  scale delays, huge cost escalation, implementation delays, etc. have contributed to  slow down in expansion of areas under irrigation. Dwindling public sector control  support for critical extension related activities and programme for land development  and soil conservation are major gaps that need urgent redressal. These disparities in  rural infrastructure too need to be addressed.                                                                   2  IDFC Rural Development Network (2013), India Rural Development Report 2012-13.

Ministry of Agriculture      11. One significant component of rural finance is the value chain finance. It  derives its significance from the fact that there are about 140 million farming  households of which more than 80 per cent are small and marginal farmers. Linking  these farmers to formal financial services is a significant challenge. If agriculture has  to support investment for the small and marginal farmers, promoting agri-business  through development of value chains looks very promising. Promoting agricultural  value chains will bring about better market opportunities, technology adoption,  private investments and reforms that would increase their access to finance besides  significant positive impact on end-consumers in terms of reasonable prices of  products. New generation private sector banks and foreign banks who have now  priority sector obligations contribute a lot in this regard. NABARD has in the recent  past, conducted some ground level studies to understand the supply chain  management issues related to onion, potato & tomato and is now according priority  to warehouse funding and creation of cold storage capacities in the country, besides  providing negotiable warehouse receipts to the farmers which, in turn, will prevent  distress sale of farm produce by the farmers.    12. It is widely recognised that commercial interests of small-scale producers are  best bridged by producer organisations including co-operatives and their federations.  Realising the importance of collective investments in productive assets, Government  of India has set up Equity Grant Fund for providing matching assistance and credit  guarantee fund (with 85 per cent default guarantee cover) for financing Farmer  Producer Companies. The Reserve Bank has also included financing producer  companies under the ambit of priority sectors. Further, NABARD has also constituted  a Producer Organisation Development Fund with a corpus of ` 500 million for  financing producer companies.  Need of the hour is to scale-up the operations of the  producer organizations.    Page 7 of 12    per cent Hassle-free financial services to the rural sector      13. Since independence, expanding the outreach of financial services to the poor  has been at the centre of the poverty alleviation policy in India. The successive  surveys of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) {All-India Debt and  Investment Surveys (AIDIS)} document a steady rise in the importance of banks as a  source of rural household credit since 1951-52. While there was a decline in the  share of banks in debt of rural households between 1991-92 and 2002-03, we can  hope for a revival in this share over the last decade going by the extensive policy  efforts for financial inclusion by the Reserve Bank and the Government of India in  collaboration with institutions oriented towards rural areas, such as, the NABARD.     14. Financial inclusion is a buzzword nowadays, not just in India, but globally as  well. At RBI, we view financial inclusion as a process that seeks to ensure access to  appropriate  financial  products  and  services  at  an  affordable  cost  in  a  fair,  transparent & secure manner  by  mainstream institutional players. This availability of  financial products and services is not only for society in  general, but  importantly, for  the vulnerable  groups, such  as,  weaker  sections, small business units  and  low   income  groups as well. Such small customers do provide a big & stable market for  retail deposits and other credit and third party products. Given the dominance of  banks, bank-led model for financial inclusion has been emphasized, but at the same  time, synergies embedded in non-bank financial players are also being tapped.     15. Several initiatives have been undertaken to expand banking services to  remote areas of the country. The branch authorisation policy has recently been  rationalised, with commercial banks directed to open not less than a quarter of their  total branches in hitherto unbanked areas. Given the challenges involved in opening  brick-and-mortar branches at a rapid pace due to resource and time constraints,  banks have been encouraged to avail of Business Correspondents (BCs)/ Business  Facilitators (BFs) to further their inclusion efforts. Further, the Reserve Bank has now  removed some of the major restrictions on use of BC model; it has allowed for-profit  NBFCs to work as BCs and the requirement of BC touch-point being within 30 km  radius of the bank branch has been dispensed with.  Banks have been persuaded to  switch over to Core Banking Solutions (CBS) and leverage technology to the  maximum extent possible. The growing focus on mobile technology to deliver  banking services is a manifestation of this initiative. Similarly, importance being  attached to non-banks and quasi-banks (payment banks, which are in the offing,  can also function as BC of other banks), is also to be seen in the context of efforts to  expand financial inclusion through technology based payment system products. With  the cloud over Aadhar based unique identity being cleared, the pilots sponsored by  the Reserve Bank for remittance related cash-outs using pre-paid instruments are  expected to gather momentum and could turn out to be a major initiative in financial  inclusion without the necessity of having bank accounts.    Page 8 of 12   16. Since 2010, commercial banks have adopted Board-approved Financial  Inclusion Plans (FIPs) containing self-set targets for financial inclusion for a span of  three years. The first span of three years ending 2013 has been quite encouraging.  Taking the process further, banks have been advised to draw up a 3-year FIP for the  next three-year period, of which one year is already behind us. A key feature this  time is that banks have been advised that their FIPs should be disaggregated to the  branch level. The disaggregation of the plans is being done to ensure the  involvement of all stakeholders in the financial inclusion efforts.    17. Having said all this, the present extent of financial inclusion does not  adequately match up to our peers, not to mention the advanced economies (Table  2). For example in 2011, just 38 per cent of the adults had accounts at formal  financial institutions in India as compared to over 50 per cent in other BRICS  economies, and even higher in the United States. Of course, the statistics would  have improved in the last three years given the policy push of the Government, the  Reserve Bank and the stakeholders.  Clearly, there is a substantial distance that we  still need to cover to achieve universal financial inclusion.     Table 2: Select Financial Inclusion Indicators for 2011    Brazil Russia India China South United  Africa States  Account at a formal financial institution,  62.0 51.9 38.0 63.3 59.1 90.7  older adults (%, age 25+)  Loan from a financial institution in the past  8.1 8.5 8.8 7.9 11.8 21.6  year, older adults (%, age 25+)  {Source: World Bank (Global Findex)}    18. In the last few years, there has been notable quantitative and qualitative  improvement in the process of financial inclusion. Today, we have realized the need  for deeper penetration of financial services in the unbanked sectors with more and  more people using various modes of banking, such as, traditional brick & mortar,  BCs/BFs channel, mobile banking, etc., to avail financial services. There are signs of  financial inclusion graduating from a policy obligation to a business proposition. The  concern, however, remains that still a large number of people remain excluded. For  instance, formal credit to small and marginal farmers and small business units  continue to be limited. Consequently, rural indebtedness from non-institutional  sources among these farmers continues to be high.  Thus questioning the efficacy of  the players and their partnerships in creating a sustainable financial inclusion plan.  At the same time, too much of mandated programmes for financial inclusion with  focus on meeting quantitative targets and the perception that financial inclusion  drives are meant to be doling out government subsidy only could degenerate the  programme to the likes of some of the populist measures without sustainable  business proposition for the providers and receivers of financial services. Hence,  there is a need for careful planning and qualitative evaluation of these programmes.  Page 9 of 12   A specific case of concern is the growing fatigue in the SHG-Bank Linkage  Programme, to which I turn now.     Issues in the SHG Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP)    19. India introduced the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP) more than two  decades back on a pilot basis. Today, it is a regular banking programme mainly due  to active involvement of NABARD and also due to the role of the Reserve Bank in  creating a conducive regulatory environment for this programme to grow. By end of  March 2013, India had about 7.3 million bank-linked SHGs with a range of financial  institutions including commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, and co-operative  banks, marginally down from 8 million recorded in 2012, exhibiting some signs of  fatigue in this programme. Further, the number of SHGs having outstanding loans  with banks has declined from 4.8 million to 4.4 million between 2011 and 2012 and  stood at 4.5 million in 2013. Similarly, the number of SHGs to whom bank loans were  disbursed declined from 1.6 million in 2010 to 1.2 million in 2011and has stagnated  thereafter.  (Table 3).     Table 3: Progress in Micro-Finance Programme by banks: Self Help Groups  (as at end-March)   Number (in millions)  2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13P  Loans disbursed  1.1 1.2 1.6 1.6 1.2 1.2 1.2  Loans outstanding  2.9 3.6 4.2 4.9 4.8 4.4 4.5    Amount (` billion)     2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13P  Loans disbursed  66 88 123 145 145 165 206  Loans outstanding 124 170 227 280 312 363 394  {Source: NABARD}    20. The major issues confronting the SHGs include inadequate number of quality  agencies required for capacity building and hand-holding, governance and  leadership challenges, lack of management information systems, inconsistent  reporting, supervision and management capacities, excessive dependence on  promoter agencies for essential services, skewed distribution of SHGs across the  regions, decline of banking sectors involvement in the programme with primacy  being attached to financial inclusion programmes which have almost excluded SHGs  from their focus, increasing incidence of NPAs, etc. The new challenges for SHGs  are how do they move up in the value chain to livelihood activities leading to  sustained income generation supported by different backward and forward linkages.  Therefore, the focus needs to shift towards consolidation of SHGs by addressing  these deficiencies. In order to overcome the fatigue of the SBLP and as part of its  poverty alleviation strategy, NABARD has taken various initiatives like SHG-2, Joint  Liability Groups (JLG) and Producer Organization related initiatives. It aims to cover  Page 10 of 12   all eligible poor rural households in the country through SBLP by March 2017 and  promote 2 million new SHGs during 2013-17. There is also a strategic shift from  State/district-based planning for SBLP to block-based planning to address the issue  of intra-district imbalances in promotion of SHGs. There has also been a focus on  convergence of SBLP with financial inclusion initiatives of the Reserve Bank and  government programmes like the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to  maximise benefits to the SHG members. In respect of the latter, it is important to  underscore that Government sponsored initiatives should not crowd out agencies  already doing good work in the field as there is enough space for multiple  stakeholders & SHGs to function. Focus on credit at the cost of savings should also  not be over emphasized and distortions leading to misuse and abuse of the system  through interest subvention also need to be avoided.    Concluding Thoughts    21. It has been repeatedly recognized that majority of the people in rural areas  depend on agriculture as a source of living though non-farm activities are gradually  gaining significance in the rural economic development. It is also recognized that  agriculture is more risky economically than industry and trade and, therefore, the  perception that rural populace are unbankable. Let us acknowledge that rural  economy is imperfect, lacks information and communications infrastructure and  coupled with geographical spread of rural population and diversity of need for small  ticket size financial transactions, developing an inclusive rural financial system is a  challenge. I have flagged some of the major challenges through a 7Ps framework  involving issues of Product strategies, Processes, Partnerships among different  players, Protection of both the providers and the receivers, Productivity of the  financial services flowing to the rural sector, and capacity, competence and  commitment of People involved in providing financial services. I am sanguine that  none of these challenges are insurmountable and have reasons to believe that the  seminar has provided several alternative solutions for achieving a sustainable  financial inclusion in India.     22. Let me conclude by saying that the Reserve Bank remains committed to  create a conducive regulatory environment where financial entities can ensure  hassle free financial services to the poor without jeopardising financial stability.  Contextually, banks may be given the freedom to determine their own financial  inclusion strategies as part of their overall business philosophy and pursue it as a  commercial activity, taking on board their risk appetite and product sophistication.  With a couple of financial service providers, and especially an erstwhile microfinance  service provider, allowed to become banks and with the possible introduction of on- tap licensing of small banks and payment banks in addition to entry of foreign banks  in the context of priority sector requirements, we hope to expand the size and scope  of the rural financial system landscape and, thereby, address the persistent and  Page 11 of 12   emerging challenges relating to rural finance and substantially improve the level of  financial inclusion in the country, both qualitatively and quantitatively.       Thank you all for your attention.      Page 12 of 12
