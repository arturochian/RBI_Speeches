Role of Financial Sector in the Growth of the Southern Region
– A Question of Balancing
Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen!
2. The importance and the lead role of financial sector for economic
development attracted the attention of economists, policy makers as well as
executors. According to Goldsmith (1969:400), “mobilizing liquid resource
accelerates economic growth and improves economic performance to the
extent that it facilitates the migration of funds to the best user, i.e. to the
place in the economic system where the funds will find the highest social
return”.
3. In the analysis of financial institutions in Schumpeter’s work, banking was
considered as one of the primary and essential factors for economic
development. In the whole process of development, Schumpeter (1933 and
1939) regarded the banking system as one of the two key agents (the other
being entrepreneurship). Given this impetus, it is worth mentioning that the
correlation between bank credit and economic growth is resilient.
4. It is thus the financial system that has been tasked to intermediate to usher
in efficient allocation of resources.  Banking system has, in fact, become
special with its main functions of mobilizing savings of public and its efficient
allocation for various productive activities and providing access to those
sections of entrepreneurs who are unable to find any formal financial service.
In the Indian context, such allocation of resources for economic activity is
done mainly by banks, but the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), the Co-
operative banks and the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) also
contribute in fulfilling this task.  In India, the guidance/directions given to the
banking system, with regard to the social banking in the 1970s and 1980s
and with the introduction of comprehensive economic and financial sector
reforms in the 1990s helped in addressing the gaps in financing economic
activities. Further, the introduction of financial inclusion and the related policy

gratefully acknowledged.measures initiated both by the Government of India and by Reserve Bank of
India in recent decade enabled banks to reach the extra mile and not to
distinguish between micro and small enterprises, street vendors, small
business entrepreneurs, etc.
5. India being such a large country that it’s different regions are at different
states of economic development and have been growing at different speeds.
Public policy does recognize this and therefore, has provisions that strategies
suiting the levels and speeds of economic growth in the regions be pursued.
6. Today, I will be focusing on the ‘Role of Financial Sector in the Growth of
the Southern Region’. Since banks are the major players in the financial
system, my talk will be centred on the role of banks for economic growth and
its future prospects for the region. I have organized my talk as follows:
(a) I will briefly discuss about major economic parameters of the southern
region.
(b) then I will be analyzing the linkage to growth based on (i) Deposits to
GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) (ii) Banks’ Credit to GSDP (Gross
State Domestic Product) (iii) C/D ratio and (iv) Urban Cooperative Banks
(UCBs) in the allocation of resources for economic activities in the region (v)
role of NBFCs and (vi) financial inclusion - general trend in the region.
(c) Thereafter, I will discuss the scope of the banking sector in the emerging
developments of the region and what more can be done by the banks to
further the growth in the region.
Economic Growth
7. During the pre - reform period of 1980s, the growth rates of the states in
the southern region were generally less than the all India growth rate. During
the 1990s, after the economic and financial sector reforms, these states
performed better than the all-India growth rate. The growth rates were still
higher, during the last 10 years or so when greater push had been given for
financial inclusion. (Pl see Table 1).

Per capita income
8. Let us now look at another indicator of economic prosperity viz., per capita
income. The per capita income of the region over the last three decades
compared with other regions showed that this region has performed very
well. In fact, during 1980s, this region’s average per capita income was below
the national average. During the 1990s, while Kerala and Tamil Nadu
surpassed the national average, AP and Karnataka were just below the
national average. However, during the 2000s, the entire region was much
more than the national average. (Pl see Table 2)

Number of offices
9. Let us now turn to the role played by the commercial banks as part of the
financial system for the progress of the region. Commercial banks, which are
involved in providing credit facilities and making investments for productive
activities as well as broadening banking practices under financial inclusion,
have expanded their offices across the region. The number of offices
(including Regional Rural Banks) expanded in the region by moving up
sharply from 17,613 end-March 1999 to 29,135 at end-March 2013
(excluding U.Ts of Pudhucherry and Lakshadweep).

4Role of banks
10. I would like to highlight the involvement of commercial banks in the
development of the region.  For measuring the role of banks, the following
parameters have been considered by me: (a) deposits to GSDP, (b) credit to
GSDP and (c) C/D ratio. The role played by banks has been analysed under
these categories in terms of: (a) prior to the introduction of financial sector
reforms; (b) post financial sector reform period and (c) inclusive growth
period. Prior to 1991, the deposit to GSDP of combined Andhra Pradesh in
1981 was hardly 28.0 per cent, credit to GSDP ratio was 21.1 per cent and
Credit to Deposit ratio was 75.3 per cent. This moved up to an impressive
level of 52.8 per cent, 58.1 per cent and 109.9 per cent, respectively, in 2013,
underscoring banking penetration for the growth in the combined State of
Andhra Pradesh (Table 4). In fact, banks have played deeper role, even
better in the rest of the region like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala states.

Urban Co-operative Banks
11. Another important institutional set up in the financial system allocating
funds for economic activities is by Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs). As at
end- March 2014, a total of 557 UCBs under both scheduled and non-
scheduled categories were operating in the region. These UCBs put-together
have mobilized public deposits totaling ` 48,461.41crore as at end-March
2014 and funded various activities in the region amounting to ` 32,146.15
crore at end-March (Table 5).

Role of NBFCs in the Region
12. As at end-March 2014, there were 995 non-banking financial companies
in the category of deposit taking, non-deposit taking and core investment
companies in the Southern Region as against 12,029 for all-India. Among the
states in the region, deposits taking financial companies are very active in the
State of Tamil Nadu (Table Nos. 6 and 7).

Financial Inclusion in the Southern Region
14. In India, even today, we have a huge slice of our populace, comprising
mainly less privileged people that remains largely excluded from the formal
financial system. In order to take the banking service to the so far financially
excluded society, constant and special measures have been taken by the
Government of India and the Reserve Bank under the ‘Financial Inclusion’
programme whereby a roadmap has been set to achieve 100 per cent
Financial Inclusion in the entire country.
15. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank, in January 2006, permitted banks to
engage Business Correspondents (BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs) as
intermediaries for providing financial and banking services.  Reserve Bank
has also from time to time enlarged the list of eligible individuals / entities
8who can be engaged as BCs. The BC model allows banks to provide door
step delivery of services especially cash in – cash out transactions at a
location much closer to the population, thus addressing the last mile problem.
16. In our efforts to achieve sustained, planned and structured financial
inclusion, we have advised all public and private sector banks to put in place
a Board approved Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) to achieve the target latest
by March 2016.  In addition, we have asked banks to integrate approved
FIPs with their business plans and to include the criteria on financial inclusion
as a parameter in the performance evaluation of their staff.
17. As a result, banks have made further stride in providing banking services
to the people. I am happy that commercial banks under ‘Financial Inclusion’
agenda are moving in tandem with the target in the entire Southern Region.
While the villages under population above 2000 have been covered, the
process for ensuring complete coverage of villages with population below
2,000 is progressing well.
18. As per CRISIL’s financial inclusion index called Inclusix, which covers
three parameters of branch penetration, deposit penetration and credit
penetration, on a scale of 100, the highest financial inclusion of 66.1 points
has been achieved by the Southern Region in 2012, as against 42.8 for all-
India. This also indicates that more extension and expansion of the country
as a whole, and even in this region.
What more for the region – A Balancing Act?
19. Let us now discuss what more the banking system can do for the region.
There are several expectations by the region out of the banking system and
there are several compulsions on the banking system. Further, there are
certain peculiar specialities in this region. A standard response by the
banking system will be to skip these. In my opinion, the banking system
9should, instead, find a fine balance between managing these peculiarities
and adhering to set best practices.
- First of course, is that the region expects continued support from the banks
for its growth lead to be maintained. That is, the region expects to maintain
the more than 100% CDR. While the banking system will be willing to be
partnering this, it will have to do so by balancing the expectations from the
rest of India.  Every region competes for greater flow of credit and financial
services and the banking system has the responsibility in addressing this.
- Second, this region is susceptible to vagaries of nature and natural calamities
strike this region in a severe way, affecting especially the agricultural sector.
Maintaining steady flow of credit to the agricultural sector is a challenge.
Complicating this is the ineffectiveness of agricultural insurance.  This region
has the peculiar, but popular, habit of gold loans smothering the agricultural
loans. In that process, the farmers do not get the benefits of agricultural
insurance. The banking system has to find a solution for this vexed problem
of balancing their need to secure their interests vis a vis the protection for the
farmers. I will return to discuss another variant of this gold loan related
problems in a minute.
- Third, like any other region, this region also wants increased flow of credit for
the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector. As is well known,
despite continuous increase in the bank credit for the MSME sector, the
formal credit flow for this sector is very meager compared to the enormous
number of units in this sector and the banking sector should tap the great
potentials of this sector.  The biggest hurdles facing the banking system are
its requirements of documentation, its traditional models of assessing the
credit needs of the MSMEs and many a time, the gap in the attitude and
sensitivity of the bank officials. It is heartening to note that the non-banking
financial companies (NBFCs) in this region have found a balanced answer to
skirt around these hurdles and their flow to this sector has recorded good
10growth in recent times. Perhaps, the banking sector can also find such a
balance.
- Fourth, another speciality of this region is the preponderance of non-formal
and informal, but riskier avenues for savings. This region is replete with
history of the so-called blade companies, varieties of formal and informal chit
funds, ponzi schemes, emu farms and other types of attractive schemes.
These schemes have time and again captured the imagination of gullible,
and even not-so-gullible people of this region, very often lured them into
losing their hard earned savings. These ever running episodes only clearly
establish the failure of the formal financial system, including the banking
system, in catering to the savings, investment and risk taking needs and
appetite of these masses. They very pithily indicate that there are savings to
be mobilised in an orderly manner; and there are people whose risk appetite
is more than ordinary or normal and the formal financial system can offer
them well regulated risky financial products. The banking system should
come out with innovative and customized savings and financial products.
This way they can balance their business opportunities with the niche needs
of these people in the region.
- Fifth, another speciality of this region is very note worthy and heartening.
That relates to the number of Self Help Groups (SHGs), especially of the
women which operate in this region. In fact, the southern region leads by
leaps and bounds in this respect. The readiness, the enthusiasm and the
dedication and discipline of these women SHGs are the backbones of their
success. In the wake of their successes, certain unhealthy practices and
certain overreactions to them had resulted in a slowdown, even in stoppage
of credit flow to this segment. Further, quite many SHGs, before they have
matured enough to handle credit and finance, have been exposed to credit.
Concomitantly, the credit discipline that had been assiduously built
painstakingly over the years has been ruptured. Restoring that spirit, while
ensuring continued flow of credit is another balance the banking system has
to find.
11Conclusion
20. Now, to conclude, we have seen how the regional economy did a
turnaround in the post reform and financial inclusion period as compared to
the pre-reform period; the regional economy has not only posted better
growth but also has surpassed certain all-India numbers. We also saw how
the banking system has, by allocating the mobilised resources, contributed to
the steady and sustained economic growth of the region over the last three
decades. We have also seen the role played by the urban cooperative banks
and the non - banking financial companies in providing access to financial
products and services and helping in allocation of credit. Finally, we
discussed some peculiarities and specialities of the region and their impact
on the banking operations and how banks need to undertake a tightrope
balancing while handling these peculiarities.
21. Thank you one and all for your kind attention.
