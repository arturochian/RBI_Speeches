GenNext Banking: Issues and Perspectives    Introduction  At the outset, let me thank the Indian Merchants Chamber for inviting me to chair this  th session on GenNext Banking of the 4 International Banking and Finance Conference 2009.  I  congratulate the organizers on having chosen such topical and germane topics as Banking   Crisis and Beyond, Credit Instruments- Beyond Vanilla Lending for the earlier sessions. I  particularly congratulate the organizers for selecting the topic GenNext Banking for this  session, which is both timely and contextual, and merits serious deliberation.   2.  As you all may be aware, India is in the midst of a demographic transition. The  demographic transition that India is going through will result in addition of millions of youth,  who are potentially a bankable population and present a unique opportunity for banking system  to expand their customer base. It has been estimated that the population in the 15-24 age group  grew from around 175 million in 1995 to 190 million in 2000 and 210 million in 2005,  increasing by an average of 3.1 million a year between 1995 and 2000 and 5 million between  2000 and 2005. In 2020, the average Indian will be only 29 years old, compared with 37 in China  and the US, 45 in West Europe and 48 in Japan.     3.  In addition to the demographic transition, other drivers of GenNext Banking are  inadequate penetration, GDP growth and availability of information and communication  technology. The issue is how the banking system will gear up and tune itself with this new  generation across the length and breadth of the country. As India is poised to be a global power  st   in the 21 century, GenNext banks will be a catalytic agent in making India a global power.  The  GenNext society / economy will essentially be a knowledge society / economy and the challenge  is to see how we can facilitate banking in a knowledge economy. There are also going to be    challenges of dealing with knowledge workers.     1  Address by Dr. K.C.Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Panel Discussion on GenNext  th Banking at the 4 International Finance and Banking Conference organized by the Indian Merchants Chamber on  November 25, 2009 in Mumbai. The Assistance provided by Dr. Deba Prasad Rath and Mr. Tarun K Singh in  preparation of the address is gratefully acknowledged. 1   4.  In the above perspective, I organize the rest of my presentation under the following  sections.  First, in Section 1, I propose to cover the macro setting for GenNext banking by way of  discussing the demographic composition of Indias population and the nexus between low  dependency ratio and saving. Section 2 provides a projection of Housing and Education Loan  requirement in the economy in the next few years.  Section 3 discusses how banks need to  emerge GenNext with suitable new schemes and reorientation of their banking activities. It also  contains a discussion on how to facilitate banking in the context of knowledge economy/society.  Section 4 concludes highlighting certain implications and challenges arising from GenNext  banking which need further deliberation.     Section 1: Demographic Composition of Indias Population    5.  According to the Technical Group on Population Projections constituted by the National  Commission on Population, May 2006, annual population growth is expected to gradually  decelerate from 1.6 per cent in the five years ending in 2006 to 0.9 per cent in the five years  ending in 2026. Indias population, which is estimated to have gone up from the Census 2001  figure of 1,029 million to 1,112 million in 2006, is projected to increase to 1,400 million by 2026  (Table 1).     6.  The age structure of a population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. The  proportion of population in the working age group of 15-64 years will increase steadily from  62.9 per cent in 2006 to 68.4 per cent in 2026. This demographic transition actually to yield a  demographic dividend would depend a lot on ensuring proper healthcare and other human  resource development such as education, etc. as also their employability into the productive  workforce of the economy.            2     Table 1 : India : Population projections (in millions)    Year  2001 2006 2011 2016 2021 2026  Total  1,029 1,112 1,193 1,269 1,340 1,400 Below 15 years 364 357 347 340 337 327 15-64 years  613 699 780 851 908 957 Above 65 years 49 56 66 78 95 116 Note: Figures for 2001 are as per Census of India 2001.

Penetration levels suggest healthy potential and target market still expanding  8. Despite the aggressive growth in most financial segments over the past decade, there is  still the under-penetration of most financial products/services.  Even though Indian banking  credit has enjoyed a significant growth during the period 2003-08, credit penetration remains  well below regional benchmarks, which is suggestive of healthy growth potential in the medium  term.  Indian financial sector offers structural growth opportunities and an expanding target  market.  In India, it is the household sector which generates largest savings in relation to the  private corporate and public sectors, in that order. A significant proportion of household  financial savings is routed through the banking system. As of 2008-09, while the household  deposits accounted for around 54 per cent of the gross financial assets, bank credit accounted for  around 94 per cent of household financial liabilities.   9.  While the credit growth during the high growth phase has encompassed all sectors  both  retail and industrial - and incremental lending has been much diversified compared to in the mid  - and late 1990s, the retail credit as a proportion of GDP has remained quite low (Table 2).      3   Table 2.

With the low existing penetration levels and the fact that more than 30 per cent of Indians  who are below 15 years of age, will enter in the age group of 15-64 years over the next 5 to 10  years, the structural opportunity for banks is evident.  The younger generation is far more open to  consumer loans, financial products like insurance, mutual funds and wealth management and  thereby offers a much bigger revenue base for financial-service providers.   11.  Although significant financial deepening has been taking place in Indian economy over  the years as seen from the deposit-GDP ratio, bank assets-GDP ratio and credit-GDP ratio, the  low levels of penetration in India can provide a medium term structural growth driver for banks.  A noteworthy feature discernible in the Indian context is that the rise in indicators of financial  deepening takes place along with a noticeable rise in the domestic savings rate. This has to be  seen in the backdrop of financial sector reforms, rise in total factor productivity and investment  boom which has led to acceleration in the growth performance.   4   Low dependency ratio and saving nexus  12. In the recent years, a virtuous cycle of growth, saving and investment has been in  operation (Table 3) and is likely to continue in the near to longer-term being contributed by  demographic dividends and decline in dependency ratio. These factors will facilitate both rise in  saving and capital formation and are expected to further reinforce the virtuous cycle of growth in  future. The existing studies on India suggest a near one-for-one relationship between the  dependency ratio and national savings. According to recent studies (Goldman Sachs 2007), 1  percentage point decrease in the dependency ratio adds 0.8 per cent to the national saving ratio.  Rodrik and Subramanian (2004) used estimation results by Mulheisen (1997) on India's  consumption behaviour, which shows a one-to-one relationship between the dependency and  saving ratios. Accordingly in India, a fall in dependency ratio from 37.1 per cent in 2006 to 34.6  in 2011 and 31.7 per cent in 2026 will result in rise in saving from the present level of 37.7 per  cent in 2007-08.

The vast business potential for banking can be ascertained from a brief empirical exercise  and a projection on the housing loan in India. The housing loan is an important component of the  loans and advances portfolio of the SCBs (Table 2). As at end-March 2009, the housing loans  constituted 44 per cent of the retail loan portfolio of SCBs and 9 per cent of the total loans and  advances of SCBs. The growth rate of housing loans, which witnessed very high growth during  2004-05 and 2005-06, has however been witnessing a deceleration since then.   14. A statistical analysis of the data on GDP, housing loan and educational loan for the  period March 2004 to March 2009 suggests that a 1 per cent increase in GDP growth is  associated with 3 per cent increase in housing loan and 5 per cent increase in education loan.  Assuming a real GDP growth rate of 6.25 per cent in 2009-10 and 8 per cent each in 2010-11 and  2011-12, and 9 per cent each during 2012-13 to 2014-2015, the housing loan is expected to grow  at 20.3 per cent in 2009-10, 25.0 per cent each in 2010-11 and 2011-12 and at 28.1 per cent  during the period 2012-13 to 2014-05.  The education loan is expected to grow at a rate of 32.3  per cent in 2009-10 and at 39.8 per cent each in 2010-11 and 2011-12 and 44.8 per cent during  the period 2012-13 to 2014-15.   15. It may be mentioned here that these estimates are indicative and based on historical data. In  reality as the country moves towards the high growth trajectory, given the strong income effect  and complex interplay of factors affecting the demand for housing, the demand for housing loans  may grow manifold. According to some estimates, presently there is a shortage of about 19.4  million housing units in India. In addition, the Indian population is projected to grow at a rate of  1.6 per cent per annum while GDP is expected to grow at a rate of 8-9 per cent per annum. As a  result, the per capita income is expected to quadruple by 2020. The Indian middle class is also  expected to expand by more than 10 times from its current size of 50 million to 583 million  people in next 18 years. Given this rise in per capita income, swelling middle class and rapid  urbanization, it is estimated that additional 45 million housing units would be required by the  year 2012. These estimates suggest that the housing loan to GDP ratio would grow sharply in the  coming years.   6   16. Size of housing financial systems as a share of GDP in a cross-country perspective  [Warnock, Veronica Cacdac and Francis E. Warnock (2008)] suggest that the emerging market  economies generally have a smaller housing financial system averaging to 10 per cent of GDP  with the largest being between 20  30 per cent of GDP and developed countries accounting for  around 55 per cent of GDP. During 2001-05, mortgage debt (housing finance) to GDP ratio for  India was lower at 4.9 per cent than other developed countries USA (67.4 per cent), UK (66.6  per cent), Japan (35.7 per cent), France (24.1 per cent) and Korea (20.8 per cent), and Asian  emerging economies like China (10.0 per cent), Malaysia (28.3 per cent), Philippines (6.8 per  cent), Taiwan (26.0 per cent) and Thailand (15.5 per cent).   17. An educated young population gives a head start in todays knowledge economy. In  India, they form the backbone of the countrys booming service sector. According to a  NASSCOM study, the number of students enrolled for tertiary education in India is close to 10  million. While banks are now regularly extending education loan for courses in India and some  banks are also contemplating extending education loans for courses aboard, this is indicative of  the growth potential of education loans in India.   Section 3: GenNext Banking  Life Cycle wise products and services available under one roof  18. The Indian banks have identified the growth potential of the Gen Next and are already  providing schemes especially keeping in mind the requirements and preferences of the younger  generation. As mentioned in the earlier section, the banking sector can help in reaping the  population dividend by providing life cycle wise products and services under one roof. Let me  elaborate on this. The GenNext banks would be offering products and services right from birth  till death. The relationship would start with birth when a savings account could be opened. I  recall PNBs scheme where soon after birth when devotees visited Golden Temple, an account  was opened for the newly born. Then as the child grows, appropriate products and services  would be offered at the right time. During infancy, small health and life insurance services could  be offered. Other features could include recurring deposit and fund transfer from parents to kids  account. As the child reaches educational stage, educational loans, debit card and two- wheeler/scooter loans could be offered. After education, as the youth enters job, then products  7   like housing loans, credit cards, etc could be offered. Equity and mutual fund products could be  offered. Once he gets a job, savings, demat and e-broking accounts could all be offered. At later  stages, the composition of investments in equity oriented schemes would shift in favour of debt  oriented as the age advances.  For entrepreneurs, loans and insurance could be offered for  entrepreneurial ventures. For people in different professions, offering products suited to their  profession would present a challenge and opportunity. If a loan is given, then non-life insurance  like that for house, education and car loans could be made available. At stage of marriage,  marriage loans could be offered. Once, he becomes old, loans for refurbishment of house etc.  would be offered and this cycle continues till funeral insurance products. Thus, the essential idea  is that a relationship once built at birth carries on till death and all the products and services are  made available under one roof. Every person will have a customized web-page where they can  simply select and avail of the various products and services required by them.   19.  The GenNext banking would thus not just be to attract the youth but to attract them at  infancy itself so that in future the bank can become the preferred source for other requirements of  the growing customer. The saving accounts for youngsters are intended to inculcate habits of  thrift. They will have to be educated and financial education initiatives would be important.  The  banks would have to envisage the changing environment by gauging the dreams and aspirations  of the youth brigade and launch/provide services accordingly.   20. The banks are also providing facilities like internet banking, tele-banking etc. recognizing  that the younger generation is much more tech-savvy and believe in saving time and energy by  using technology. Banks are also opening exclusive branches for GenNext, which cater to all the  aspects of banking for the young population. But, in my opinion, for GenNext banking to be a  success, staff at all branches would have to be youth-oriented otherwise it is naturally not  possible to reach the vast majority of our youth. To sum up, the various dimensions of GenNext  banking which will have a profound impact are information requirement, number, volume,  diversity, density and delivery model among others.   Knowledge Economy and Reorientation in Indian Banking  21. It is now commonplace to say that the 21st Century will be the Knowledge Century and  we are transiting from product-based to knowledge-based economy. The knowledge economy -  8   an economy in which Wealth is based upon the ownership of knowledge and the ability to use  that knowledge to create or improve goods and services  presents significant challenges. All the  more so due to the demographic transition underway now in our country, since knowledge  resources such as know-how and expertise are as critical as other economic resources in this  economy. India will probably have the worlds largest set of young people. Even as other  countries begin to age, India will remain a country of young people, potentially to our great  advantage.  22. The transformation of banking caused by the rapid development of information and  communication technologies has provided banking entities with new ways of bringing their  products to the customers. The banks would now have to increasingly deal with knowledge  workers i.e. one who works primarily with information and uses knowledge in the work place.  Traditional banking has thus changed into electronic banking, and therefore the standard form of  contact  personal contact  is taking a back seat to new, faster, more conformable, and cheaper  means of communication.   23. The introduction of electronic banking services also creates new tasks to be faced, such  as the optimization of distribution channels and the security of data transfer. The customer will  not purchase a service that fails to meet his requirements or a service that does not guarantee the  required privacy and security. That is why banks are trying to devote enough attention to all  aspects of the modernization of traditional banking.   24. Basic electronic banking includes services provided through self-service zones, Internet  Banking, E-mail Banking and Phone Banking etc. A new product is the electronic purse,  sometimes called a "multipurpose payment card", which is a payment instrument for making  non-cash payments. The e-shop represents a specific form of electronic banking. Electronic  commerce comes in three basic forms: the e-shop, e-store, and e-exchange.   25. Indias banking industry must strengthen itself significantly if it has to support the  modern and vibrant economy which India aspires to be. Focusing on enriching human capital  will help the banking sector competitive. The banking sector needs to fundamentally strengthen  institutional skill levels especially in sales and marketing, service operations, risk management  9   and the overall organisational performance ethic. The last, i.e., strengthening human capital will  be the single biggest challenge. Old private sector banks also have the need to fundamentally  strengthen skill levels. However, even more imperative is their need to examine their  participation in the Indian banking sector and their ability to remain independent in the light of  the discontinuities in the sector.  26. In the field of the knowledge economy, the re-orientation in banking is required at two  levels. The first is the field of banking management, the continuous improvement of which  relates mainly to expanding the use of information technologies and knowledge systems. This  will involve, above all, support for financial system management, internal quality management  systems in banks, interactive payment systems, and management information systems.  27. The field of banking management is closely connected with the second field  banking  products along with the services and operations directly related with them. On the one hand,  there are products directly connected with progressive information technologies  electronic  banking and electronic commerce. A second group comprises products and services which in  terms of formation and quality of provision are directly related to the quality, reliability and  speed of information technologies. One of the most important components of the knowledge  economy is the people who use the information and communication technologies.   Section 4: Issues and Challenges  28.  The expansion of banking services for the millions of new customers would imply that  there would be tremendous growth in the volume of such services. While this presents  tremendous business opportunities for the banking sector, it also raises new issues and challenges  for the players, regulators and policy makers.   29.  As the banking sector takes initiatives to cater to the evolving needs of the economy, we  need to deliberate on the following issues:   i) What are the appropriate systems and structure to generate information for future  generation banks? Let us not do GenNext banking without information.  10   ii) Will the existing players be able to meet the required volume, number, density and  diversity of services?  If not, would new players, such as MFIs, NBFCs, Corporates,  telecom companies and foreign players be authorized to perform these services?   iii) What should be the Delivery Structure for the entire financial system for seamless  delivery of all products under one roof? Should the model be based on universal  banking, subsidiary or collaborative route?  iv) What should be the delivery model at grass root level? Should it be by way of direct or  indirect approach?  Given the dimensions of business involved, a multichannel delivery  system utilizing a combination of branches, smart cards and mobile services appears to  be the most appropriate model.      v) What are the policy changes necessary to meet these challenges and to facilitate growth  and transition?   vi)  What should be regulatory framework for meeting these challenges? Does it not require  a 180 change?  Since there are a large number and variety of financial products  involved, what appropriate regulatory framework needs to be in place for effective  regulation? The question that may need to be examined would be the appropriateness of  single versus multiple regulators. Whether the existing regulatory co-ordination  mechanism, as followed through HLCCFM, continue in the same form? Is there a need  to separate regulation from supervision?    vii) What should be Business Model in terms of pricing, marketing, product development?  Transparency in pricing is the key in the context of the huge volumes involved and  banks may need to examine the level of their margins. Treating Customers Fairly will  be a crucial issue for GenNext banking as the customers will be more educated and  aware of their rights.      viii) What should be the approach to Risk Management Framework? In view of the large  volume, products and customers involved and the exponential growth taking place in  banking services, how risk management will evolve to mitigate the emerging risks?  ix) What are the institutions and supporting requirements and challenges in the  Technology, Communication and Network Connectivity which will enable seamless  services in a secured and cost-effective environment?    x) HR issues will assume prominence as the banks may have to assess the skill requirement  for providing such services and accordingly create the workforce.       30. To sum up, I have attempted to outline the scope for increasing the banking industry's  operations and competitiveness through information and communication technologies in the  11   context of demographic trends of India and the knowledge economy that we are embarking upon.  I hope that this conference will further deliberate on these issues and come out with the  appropriate framework to be developed through which all players will work together to establish  the system to cater to the requirements of the future. It is important that all the banking products  be made available under one roof and provided in a seamless manner; otherwise, we would lose  st this opportunity. I am sure that 21 century will be our century and the banking sector will rise to  these challenges and more. I wish the deliberations a success.   Thank you.                                12     Select Reference     1. Goldman Sachs (2007), Indias Rising Growth Potential, January 2007.  2.
