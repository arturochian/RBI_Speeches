*Global Liquidity and Financial ContagionI thank Mrs. Usha Thorat, Director, Centre for Advanced Financial Researchand Learning (CAFRAL) for the opportunity of being a part of this very distinguishedpanel. With the “great moderation” of high growth and low inflation, consideration ofliquidity almost fell off from the lexicon of central banks. Arguably, with centralbanks targeting interest rates, liquidity becomes endogenous. Of course, liquidity isthe flip side of the same coin. If one were to target a very low interest rate, one wouldhave to let go of liquidity.While monetary policy is conducted by countries keeping in view theirdomestic objectives, liquidity cannot be confined to sovereign boundaries. The biggerand more systemic a country is, the greater is the spillover, particularly if it is areserve currency country. The events leading up to the “great recession” made uscognisant of the role played by excessive global liquidity in the financial crisis. Asthe global economy pulled out of the great recession, liquidity played an even greaterrole in terms of unconventional monetary policy.As recovery takes hold in advanced economies and central banks exit fromtheir excessively accommodative monetary policy, liquidity for sure will play animportant role, some glimpse of which we had in the May 2013 announcement oftaper by the US Fed. Though market reaction was muted in the subsequent December2013 Fed announcement of calibrated reduction of its bond purchase programme,how the situation will evolve is uncertain. But certainly, consideration of liquidity hascome to occupy centre stage in policy analysis. The ebb and flow of global liquidityis of greater concern for emerging market economies (EMEs) like ours.Against this backdrop, I will begin by reviewing the concept and the trend inglobal liquidity. I then highlight the impact of global liquidity on asset markets andEMEs before turning to our experience in managing the spillover.*Remarks by Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director at the Conference on Capital Account Managementand Macro-Prudential Regulation for Financial Stability and Growth organised by the Centre for AdvancedFinancial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) and Initiative for Policy Dialogue (iPD), New Delhi, January 14,2014. The assistance provided by Rajan Goyal, Rajeev Jain and Somnath Sharma is acknowledged.1Concept and TrendTraditionally, liquidity is seen in terms of the balance sheet of the central bankor more broadly the balance sheet of the banking sector. It could be some measure ofnarrow money or broad money. However, financial innovation and technology hasmade it possible to generate substantial financial liquidity outside the monetarysector. The global financial crisis has prompted the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to come up with amuch wider concept of global liquidity.The BIS-IMF definition of the global liquidity emphasises on the “ease offinancing” as a key attribute. It depends upon the existing macroeconomicenvironment, monetary policy stance, financial regulation and a host of other factorssuch as the pace of financial innovation and risk appetite that guide the actions ofmarket participants.Indicators of global liquidity can broadly be classified into two categories:price based indicators and quantity based indicators. Price based indicators tend toprovide information about the conditions at which liquidity is provided, whilequantity measures capture how far such conditions translate into the build-up of1potential risks . Policy rates, short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, termspreads, deviations of levels from trends, and deviations of term spreads from trendsare all regarded as important indicators of global liquidity conditions.  On the otherhand, quantity-based indicators of global liquidity measure both assets and liabilitiesof globally active financial intermediaries. Generally, it is the asset-side approach,which is considered more appropriate as it represents the actual extension ofinternational credit. These two approaches represent the same underlying2phenomenon and complement each other .  Let me now turn to the recent trend inglobal liquidity.1BIS (2011), “Global liquidity - concept, measurement and policy implications”, CGFS Publications No 45,November 2011.2IMF (2013), ‘‘Global Liquidity-Credit and Funding Indicators’’, IMF Policy Paper, July 16, 2013.2Immediate rise in global liquidity in the post-crisis period was the result ofunusual policy accommodation in the advanced economies. In an effort to prop uptheir financial systems, monetary authorities in the advanced economies resorted toaggressive monetary easing by reducing policy rates to near zero (Chart 1). However,the key channels of conventional monetary policy were impaired once policy ratesapproached the zero lower bound.Chart 1: Key Policy Rates: Select Advanced Economies76543210US-Intended Fed Funds RateUK-Bank RateECB-Interest Rate on Main Refinancing OperationsJapan-Basic Discount RateSource: Respective Central Bank Webistes.Recognising the limitations of conventional policy tools and the severity of theeconomic downturn, major central banks turned to substantial liquidity injection byexpanding their balance sheets in various unconventional ways (Chart 2).3Per centJan/00Apr/01Jul/02Oct/03Jan/05Apr/06Jul/07Oct/08Jan/10Apr/11Jul/12Oct/13Chart 2: Central Bank Balance Sheets50454035302520151050US Fed BoE BoJ ECB RBI2007 2008 2012 2013Note: Data are sourced from respective central bank websites.

Let me now turn to the impact of such ebb and flow of global liquidity on assetmarkets and the EMEs.Chart 3: Year-on-Year Growth in International Claims2520151050-5-10-15Cross-border credit (yoy) Domestic credit (yoy)Source: IMF, International Financial Statistics; BIS international banking statistics; BIS calculationsImpact on EMEsAn environment of excessive global liquidity has been associated with highcapital inflows to EMEs. During the phase of excess liquidity, global investorsseeking higher yields shift their portfolios towards emerging markets exhibiting4Per cent to GDPPer cent2001Q12001Q32002Q12002Q32003Q12003Q32004Q12004Q32005Q12005Q32006Q12006Q32007Q12007Q32008Q12008Q32009Q12009Q32010Q12010Q32011Q12011Q32012Q12012Q32013Q1higher interest rates and better economic prospects. This is reflected in strong capitalflows to EMEs, which may not always be consistent with their domesticfundamentals (Chart4). This has implications for exchange rates, domestic monetaryand liquidity conditions and overall macroeconomic and financial stability.While high and unstable capital flows can lead to macro and financial stabilityconcerns, managing capital flows to minimise such concerns has costs. Globalliquidity could potentially lead to over-heating through augmenting domesticliquidity; loss of competitiveness through exchange rate appreciation; and increasedvulnerability to crisis through spillover to various segments of financial sector.Furthermore, fluctuations in global liquidity make capital flows to EMEs moreunstable. This in turn makes it difficult for policymakers to assess and distinguishbetween the durable and transitory components of capital flows, constraining theirability to effectively pursue domestic policy objectives. In short, capital flowsinconsistent with domestic absorptive capacities in EMEs complicate macroeconomicmanagement.Chart 4: Cross Border Credit Growth and Capital Inflows to EMEs400 25203001520010100500-5-100-10-200-15-300 -20Capital Inflows to EMEs Cross border credit growthSource: IIF and BISIt is also argued that major central banks engaging in ultra-accommodativemonetary policies at the same time give a large positive shock to global liquidity that3feeds into commodity and food price inflation.

Correlation between cross-border credit andinternational commodity prices suggests a possible link between global liquidity andfinancialisation of commodity markets.In 2008, global capital inflows retreated from the EMEs. The resumption ofcapital flows to countries in 2009 with a strong growth outlook or appreciationexpectations brought back pressures on the exchange rate and rising asset valuations,including equities (Chart 5). Many emerging markets met these challenges with a mixof macroeconomic policies as well as macro-prudential and other capital flowmanagement measures.Chart 5: Emerging Economies Capital Flows and Stock Market Indices350 300300250250200200150100 150501000-5050-100-150 0FDI Inflows Portfolio Inflows: EquityPortfolio Inflows: Debt Other InflowsEmerging Economies Stock Market IndicesSource: IIF and World Bank.

Hence, capital inflows resulted in both the appreciation of theRupee and accretion to foreign exchange reserves.In the context of intervention in the foreign exchange market, the issue of costof sterilisation invariably comes up for discussion. But the issue is a complex one:should one look purely at the financial cost measured largely in terms of interest ratedifferential between foreign and domestic interest rates? Should one look at the costof non-intervention in terms of its implications for financial stability, which is ofcourse difficult to quantify but perhaps easy to understand? In any case, the financialcost of sterilisation is in the nature of a quasi-fiscal cost: if it is borne by the centralbank, profit transfer to the government reduces to that extent; if it is directly borne bythe government, it is reflected in the budget. In addition, if sterilisation is donethrough raising unremunerated cash reserve ratio (CRR), the cost is borne bycommercial banks, though they may benefit from easy liquidity. In its interventionoperations, the Reserve Bank followed a cost sharing approach with the financialcosts shared by the RBI, government and commercial banks. With the hindsight I7USD billionJan/07May/07Sep/07Jan/08May/08Sep/08Jan/09May/09Sep/09Jan/10May/10Sep/10Jan/11May/11Sep/11Jan/12May/12Sep/12Jan/13May/13Sep/13Exchange Ratecould venture to say that the liquidity buffers that were built up earlier helped duringthe crisis.Deleveraging during the crisis led to reversal of capital flows. India’s balanceof payments came under pressure in Q3 of 2008-09 due to capital outflows. It becamenecessary to draw down reserves to finance the shortfall and maintain orderlyconditions in the foreign exchange market. This led to a corresponding contraction inthe base (reserve) money. The Reserve Bank, therefore, ensured the necessaryexpansion in net domestic assets (NDA) through conventional open marketoperations (OMO) involving outright purchase of government securities in thesecondary market as well as provision of liquidity through repos under its dailyliquidity adjustment facility (LAF).Another instrument, which allowed the Reserve Bank to expand liquidity, was5the unwinding of the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) securities .  The unwindingof MSS balances not only created the scope for adequate liquidity expansion by theReserve Bank without expanding its balance sheet in any significant measure, but thetiming of the unwinding could also be modulated in such a way that the largeborrowing programme of the government was managed smoothly without exertingundue market stress. In addition, the reduction in cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banksfrom 9 per cent to 5 per cent released 1.6 trillion of primary liquidity. Liquidityexpansion achieved through unwinding of MSS and reduction in CRR ensured thatthe Reserve Bank’s balance sheet did not expand significantly, unlike in several othercentral banks.  Thus the liquidity buffer built up in the pre-crisis period helped to easeboth foreign exchange and rupee liquidity.Since India witnessed stronger growth ahead of the global recovery, capitalinflow revived during 2009-10 and 2010-11 and was reflected in significantappreciation of the Rupee. It was also supported by ample global liquidity conditionsemanating from quantitative easing (QE). However, during the euro area crisis,deleveraging in European banking system again adversely affected capital flows to5 MSS securities are essentially short-term government securities, introduced in April 2004, as an instrument ofsterilisation to partly neutralise the expansionary effects of surges in capital inflows. The amount sterilisedthrough MSS remained immobilised in the Central Government’s account with the Reserve Bank of India. Asat end-September 2008, MSS amount stood over`1.7 trillion.8India towards the later part of 2011-12. In response, several policy measures weretaken to encourage capital inflows, particularly giving greater access to internationalinvestors to domestic currency debt market.Again, volatility in the financial market returned following the announcementin May 2013 of the US Fed’s intention of likely tapering of QE. Portfolio outflows,particularly from the domestic currency debt segment, were substantial. Thisprompted the Reserve Bank to resort to somewhat unconventional monetary policymeasures besides drawing down of foreign exchange reserves to meet the immediateshortfall. Let me give you the essence of the key measures. In terms of monetary policy, the upper bound of the policy rate corridor (i.e.,MSF rate) was raised by 200 basis points and the quantity of central bankliquidity available through the LAF window was restrained. This had thedesired effect of tightening the monetary conditions and raising the effectivepolicy rate sharply to the MSF rate. In order to signal that the above measure is temporary so that the interestrates at the longer end do not harden, a form of operation twist was tried byconducting outright OMO purchase of government securities alongside saleof short-term government cash management bills. This inverted the yieldcurve, though accompanied by some increase in long-term rates. With a view to containing the current account deficit (CAD) on the balanceof payments (BoP), gold imports were restricted. The non-resident deposit schemes and domestic banks’ borrowing abroadwere further liberalised with incentives for swapping these inflows directlywith the Reserve Bank. This substantially augmented foreign exchangereserves despite some outflow on account of directly meeting the foreignexchange requirement of oil imports.      As portfolio capital outflows waned and BoP improved, stability returned tothe foreign exchange market. This prompted the Reserve Bank to unwind the bulk ofthe exceptional measures and normalise monetary policy by restoring the policyinterest rate corridor to its original configuration and the repo rate to its signaling roleof policy.9ConclusionLet me conclude. Excess global liquidity emanating from accommodativemonetary policy stance in advanced economies has raised asset prices and impartedgreater volatility to capital flows to EMEs. In episodes of liquidity stress, capitalaccount and exchange rate management seem to override the domestic monetarypolicy objectives of growth-inflation considerations. As aptly observed by HélèneRey (2013), “independent monetary policies are possible if and only if the capital6account is managed”. In India, we experienced two episodes of severe stress on ourbalance of payments emanating from volatile capital flows which were managed witha combination of polity tools. Given that the central bank balance sheets in advancedcountries are still bloated and the actual taper starting now, considerable uncertaintiesremain for global financial markets and capital flows to the EMEs.Thank you.6Rey, Hélène (2013), “Dilemma not Trilemma: The Global Financial Cycle and Monetary PolicyIndependence”, paper presented in 2013 Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank ofKansas City.10
