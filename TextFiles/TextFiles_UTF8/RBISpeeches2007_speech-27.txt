1 First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy: Underlying Macroeconomics      Shri Bhatt and distinguished participants,     I am deeply honoured to be invited to deliver the valedictory address at the  High Powered Macroeconomic Workshop organised by the State Bank of India.  I am  particularly gratified that this Workshop has become a reality, since its genesis is in  the extremely useful discussions that we in the Reserve Bank of India had with the  Indian Banks Association as part of pre-Annual Policy consultations held in April this  year.    The success of any monetary policy formulation is dependent on successful  communication between the central bank and all market participants.  The  effectiveness of communication would be greatly enhanced if there is deeper  understanding among participants of all the reasoning and the process that goes  behind policy making.  So we greatly value this initiative that you have taken.  On July 31, we set out our first quarter review of the annual policy and you are  all aware of the response of financial markets and the banking and financial system  to our announcement.  Today, I propose to move away from the minutiae of the  policy review and share with you my thoughts on the underlying macroeconomics  and the unfolding of expectations for the period ahead.         I propose to structure my address by beginning with an overview of domestic  and global macroeconomic developments that conditioned our assessment and  response on July 31.  My approach will be to compare the current situation with that  prevailing in April 2007 i.e., at the time of the Annual Policy Statement, in order to  highlight the changes that have taken place within the Indian economy but more  perceptibly, in the international environment.  Against this backdrop, I will try to set  out the key elements of our assessment of underlying developments, the  complexities and the challenges. Finally, I will draw upon the rationale emerging from  this assessment to explain the stance of the first quarter review.                                                          1  Valedictory Address by Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India on August 3,  2007at the Workshop for Top Executives of Banks on Macroeconomic Issues and their Relevance to  the Banking System organised by the State Bank of India. Assistance of M.D. Patra and Indranil  Bhattacharya in preparing the speech is gratefully acknowledged.     1  I. Overview of Macroeconomic Developments  Then and Now   You will all recall that the Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 was formulated  at a time when the Indian economy was seen to be facing the intensification of  demand pressures which, coupled with supply constraints, were showing up in  inflation (as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)), ruling above 6 per cent  through the preceding quarter (January-March, 2007).  Consumer price inflation was  even higher.  There was also expectation internationally at that time that the global  economy was moderating after unusually high growth in the last few years.   However, some volatility had been observed in international financial markets and  there was some expectation of repricing of risks, and its potential effects on financial  markets.  Overall, while prospects for growth continued to be favourable, monetary  authorities around the world were showing an inclination to be watchful about risks to  price and financial stability.  By late July, while the evolution of macroeconomic and  financial developments was broadly on track, with some upward revisions about  growth prospects, there are some incipient shifts taking place in sentiment, liquidity  and market conditions, particularly in the presence of some volatility in financial  markets.  Policy responses of central banks across the world have acquired a tone of  increased caution.         (a) Domestic Developments      In February 2007 i.e., prior to the Annual Policy Statement, the CSO had  placed real GDP growth at 9.2 per cent in 2006-07.  By the time of the first quarter  review, the CSO had revised this estimate to 9.4 per cent, indicative of the  improvement in aggregate supply conditions, but also pointing to the firming up of  demand pressures. In the first quarter of 2007-08, some supply conditions seem to  have improved.  The arrival of the rabi harvest, a satisfactory south-west monsoon  so far and a slow catch-up in kharif sowing provides grounds for optimism regarding  agricultural performance this year.  Activity in the industrial and services sectors has  continued apace, though there seems to have been some moderation in specific  sectors.  In the disposition of aggregate demand, however, there appear to be signs  of some shifts underway.  Although the demand for consumer non-durables has  picked up, the coincident high growth in capital goods and non-oil imports,  secondary effects on intermediate goods and stretched capacity utilisation together   2suggest that investment demand could be intensifying. There seems to be a general  optimism about Indias growth prospects in projections made by various agencies;  some agencies have taken the lead in initiating upward revisions (Table 1).     Table 1: Projections of Real GDP for India by various Agencies: 2007-08  (Per cent) Agency Overall GrowthAgriculture Industry Services Month of  Projection  1 2 3 4 5 6  ABN Amro 7.6    March 2007 Asian Development Bank 8.0    March 2007 Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) 8.5 3.0 9.3 9.9 April 2007  9.23.09.411.2 July 2007 Centre for Monitoring the Indian 8.5    June 2007 Economy (CMIE)  Citigroup 9.33.010.310.9 April 2007 CRISIL 7.9-8.43.08.4-9.19.3-9.9 March/   June 2007 Economic Advisory Council to the Prime 9.0 2.5 10.6 10.4 July 2007 Minister  ICRA 8.5    April 2007 Indicus Analytics 8.4 3.0 7.9 9.7 April 2007 International Monetary Fund 8.4*    April 2007 9.0* July  2007 JP Morgan 8.0    March 2007 Organisation for Economic Cooperation 8.5    May 2007 and Development (OECD)  National Council for Applied 8.3 2.6 8.7 9.9 April 2007 Economic Research (NCAER)  Reserve Bank of India 8.5    April 2007/ July 2007 Median Projection (Q1 Review)                    8.5  Median Projection (Annual Policy                    8.4  Statement   : Not Available.                           * : Calendar Year.     Within this overall picture of the real economy, headwinds to growth seem to  be reshaping the outlook. While corporate performance continues to be buoyant as  assessed in April, there is some deceleration in corporate sales and profitability  growth on a year-on-year basis as also increases in input and staff costs.  There is  some indication of a turn in business sentiment with the optimism reflected in various  surveys conducted at the time of the Annual Policy Statement having been  moderated by rising cost expectations, strained capacities and the impact of recent  exchange rate movements, particularly in IT, commercial vehicles, auto parts and  cement.      3 The key monetary and banking aggregates are exhibiting somewhat diverging  profiles. Money supply is running well above the indicative path given in the Annual  Policy Statement in April, driven up by the expansion in reserve money and high  growth in deposits.  With banks having launched aggressive mobilisation strategies,  presumably in response to the high credit demand of the last few years, there has  been high growth in aggregate deposits in the banking system.  Consequent to the  lagged and cumulative effects of monetary measures taken since September 2004,  there has been some slackening of non-food credit growth. Banks SLR portfolios (at  28.7 per cent of NDTL on July 6) have increased.  This will help them to mitigate  balance sheet risks and also allow for better liquidity management.  The deceleration  in credit demand has been localised in the commercial real estate, housing and retail  segments.  On the other hand, the pick up in bank credit to agriculture and industry  is favourable to sustaining the growth momentum (Table 2).

Source : Reserve Bank of India.         4The combination of rising deposit growth and moderation of non-food credit growth is  contributing to the prevalence of excess liquidity conditions in the financial markets.    With the imposition of a ceiling of Rs.3,000 crore on daily LAF reverse repos since  March 5, 2007, the summary measure of the liquidity overhang, i.e., the sum of LAF,  MSS and outstanding cash balances of the government, did not fully capture the  counterpart  liquidity shifts in the market during this period as the net position in the  LAF presents only a partial picture.  A large part of the liquidity that would have  otherwise been absorbed under the LAF is currently showing up in excess CRR  balances and in banks investments in money market mutual funds.  On the other  hand, the transfer of funds from the Government to the Reserve Bank on account of  the sale of the Reserve Banks stake in the State Bank of India has had the indirect  effect of impounding market liquidity on a temporary basis. Thus, new factors have  been impinging the assessment of liquidity in recent weeks, which has been  reflected in the behaviour of overnight market rates and in the Reserve Banks  liquidity management operations (Table 3).

Overnight  rates have been close to zero for a prolonged period of time (Chart 1).  These have  been caused by the cumulative impact of the unwinding of government cash  balances, excess capital flows, and high deposit growth.  In the Government  securities market, there is reasonable stability but the yield curve seems to be  indicating that excess liquidity conditions in the short term segment was beginning to  effect longer term yields.  The forex market is experiencing continuous upward  pressures on the spot exchange rate and forward premia have declined across  maturities.

It  may be recalled that in January 2007, the resolve of monetary policy was stated as  returning inflation to within the policy tolerance threshold on a priority basis.  Against  the backdrop of the spike in WPI inflation in January and the persistence in the  hardening of consumer prices, this stance was reinforced in April. The combination  of monetary, fiscal and supply management measures appears to have had a  salutary effect on inflation expectations and from end-May there has been a distinct  easing of inflation in terms of the headline. Yet, inflation pressures appear to be   6 Rupees crore 31-Mar- Per cent 06 9-May- 06 9-Jun-06 12-Jul-06 14-Aug- 06 15-Sep- 06 19-Oct- 06 23-Nov- 06 27-Dec- 06 2-Feb-07 8-Mar-07 Rupees crore Per cent 3-Apr-07 10-Apr-07 16-Apr-07 20-Apr-07 26-Apr-07 4-May-07 10-May-07 16-May-07 22-May-07 28-May-07 1-Jun-07 7-Jun-07 13-Jun-07 17-Jun-07 21-Jun-07 25-Jun-07 29-Jun-07 3-Jul-07 7-Jul-07 11-Jul-07ruling firmly.  Excluding the decline in energy prices since February, WPI inflation  continues to be above 6 per cent.  Excluding food and energy prices, inflation would  still be above the headline. Inflation in terms of consumer prices is still in the range of  5.7-7.8 per cent.  Besides, global prices of key food grains such as wheat and rice,  and of oilseeds and livestock products are at historically elevated levels, igniting  international concern on the effect of these prices on overall inflation.  With food  having a higher weight in price indices in developing countries, this development is  of particular concern to countries such as ours.  International crude prices are high  and volatile with expectations that they would remain at these levels through 2007.  These factors would have a definite bearing on the manner in which the inflation  outlook in India evolves over the months to come.  Inflation concerns remain with us  and thus our vigil on inflation must continue. There are no grounds for complacency  on this account.       The balance of payments outlook remains strong and resilient between April  and now. A sharper than expected increase in non-oil imports has resulted in a  widening of the merchandise trade deficit in the early months of 2007-08. The key  difference between expectations and outlook relating to the external sector is the  magnitude of capital inflows received so far. In reflection, the foreign exchange  reserves have gone up by nearly US $ 23 billion during April-July 20, which is  already nearly half of the entire reserve accretion during the year 2006-07. By  current indications, managing capital flows and consequently, liquidity will be the  main challenge facing monetary policy in 2007-08.        (b) Global Developments     The key change in the global outlook between April and July is the upward  revision by the IMF in global growth forecasts for 2007 and 2008 from 4.9 per cent to  5.2 per cent.  This upward revision is expected to be shared by all major mature  economies, barring the US, as well as the emerging market economies (EMEs),  particularly China and India.  In the EMEs which are progressively increasing their  contribution to global growth, the prospects are strong but embedded with risks of  overheating, volatile crude prices, leveraged international financial markets and  persisting global imbalances.  In China, in particular, there have been rising  concerns, as stated by their highest authorities, that the growth process could have   7the potential of becoming unstable and unsustainable. Inflation concerns have  become renewed on the back of the flare up of crude prices alongside elevated  levels of food and metal prices (Table 4).

Source:   Based on World Bank's actual commodity price data.  The year 2004 has been taken  as the base to better exhibit price trends over the relevant period.       Global financial markets, which faced major episodes of turbulence in May- June, 2006 and again in February 2007, seem to be experiencing heightened  volatility again in July due to the fall in confidence related to the adverse  developments in the US subprime mortgage market transmitted to other segments  through the highly leveraged activities of hedge funds and private equity funds. Even  as financial markets are repricing risks, there continues to be a compression of risk  spreads and an ever widening search for returns, interrupted by sporadic flights to  safety.  While there seem to be signs of some abatement in the carry trade, there are  persisting uncertainties and EMEs, in particular, need to be on guard against the  manner in which carry trades unfold.  Perhaps, the most volatile segments have   8been currency and equity markets with increasing linkages and potential vulnerability  to contagion effects.    In response to these developments, several monetary authorities have  continued to display a readiness to tighten monetary policy further in reinforcement  of their stance in April.  Central banks in EMEs have supported the withdrawal of  monetary accommodation with successive increases in cash reserve requirements  and in the application of non-monetary measures.  In India and China, in particular,  the use of cash reserve requirements has been more frequent than in other EMEs  (Table 5).   Table 5 : Cash Reserve Ratio  (per cent)  China India  Effective CRR Effective CRR  4.50  Sept-21,2003 7.00Jun-14,2003  4.75  April-25,2004 7.50Sep-18,2004  5.00  July-5,2006 8.00Oct-2,2004  5.25  Aug-15,2006 8.50Dec-23,2006  5.50  Nov-15,2006 9.00Jan-6,2007  5.75  Jan-15,2007 9.50Feb-17,2007  6.00  Feb-25,2007 10.00March-3,2007  6.25  April-15,2007 10.50April-14,20007  6.50  May-15,2007 11.00April-28,2007  June-5,2007 11.50Aug-4, 2007 7.00  Aug-15,2007 12.00          Thus, central banks across the world remain hawkish with respect to inflation  and prepared to act against any signs of instability developing.  Where they have  paused, as in the US, they have done so on the back of sustained prior action.  The  outlook on inflation continues to drive the response of central banks (Table 6).    9   Table 6: Key Macroeconomic Indicators: Emerging Markets  (Per cent) Country Consumer Current Real Central Govt.

One key issue that many of the key Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) are  facing is the issue of excess forex flows, both because of a current account surplus  in most cases, and additional capital flows. In this regard, the key difference between  India and most of these economies is the existence of a current account deficit,  though modest, along with a significant merchandise trade deficit which is now in   10excess of 7 per cent of GDP. Most of these countries, along with us, have  experienced significant real exchange rate appreciation over the last year or two. So  the practice of monetary management has encountered significant complexity in a  number of EMEs. We are not alone.  We may note that we have so far been  managing this complexity relatively successfully within the context of high economic  growth, high credit growth, a reasonable degree of price stability and most  importantly maintenance of financial stability. The quality of bank balance sheets has  been improving on a continuous basis, and we are hopeful that they will reach  international best practice soon.  It is interesting to observe that, just like us, many of  these countries have been using the whole range of monetary instruments, including  direct sterilisation through issuance of government or central bank bonds, increases  in reserve requirements, and different means of capital account management to  manage the monetary impact of excess forex flows. The overall problem of the  capital flows, both from the point of view of the monetary management of EMEs and  reverse capital flows to industrialised countries, is now receiving worldwide attention.  The Committee of Global Financial System (CGFS) under the aegis of BIS has also  appointed a Working Group to look into these complex issues.     II. Macroeconomics of Policy Assessment  Domestic macroeconomic prospects are currently seen to be broadly  favourable, with the pace of growth being maintained and the inflation outlook softer.  As already stated, however, the attendant risks from global developments relating to  food, commodity, and energy prices remain and will have to be monitored carefully,  and acted upon as necessary.  In an overall perspective, the main objective of policy  as set out in April, is to manage the transition to higher growth with price and  financial stability. The key issues for the conduct of monetary policy in the context of  this objective are a continuing emphasis on price stability and well anchored inflation  expectations.  This will involve managing liquidity in the presence of the pressures  from high deposit growth, shifts in government cash balances and continuing capital  flows. The flux in global financial markets is a clear and present danger to stability for  which policy makers and all stake holders have to be well prepared. Exchange rate  movements have become amplified by these developments.  Going forward, it will be  necessary to reinforce the commitment to financial stability alongside the  containment of inflation so as to support growth.  The Reserve Bank's Annual Policy   11statement had announced the initiation of further development of financial markets,  such as the work related to currency futures, interest rate futures and credit default  swaps.  Our annual publication, Report on Currency and Finance has, this year, paid  particular attention to the overall development of financial markets in some detail.   The key element of our approach is the maintenance of financial stability, along with  the continuous development of markets.  Against this backdrop and a careful assessment of the balance of risks, the  projection of real GDP growth for 2007-08 has been retained around at 8.5 per cent  as in the Annual Policy Statement.  A key assumption is that agriculture will post a  return to trend growth and the momentum will be maintained in industry and  services. While the outlook for inflation remains unchanged, the policy priority in the  first quarter review is to hold headline inflation within 5 per cent in 2007-08 and  within 4.0 - 4.5 per cent over the medium term.  While money supply and aggregate  deposits are currently high, moderating the growth of these key aggregates has  assumed policy priority.  Early indications suggest that the balance of payments  position is strong, that the current account deficit will be managed within sustainable  limits but the uncertainties and volatility associated with capital flows will test the  evolving policy stance.    While the domestic outlook is positive and should remain so with appropriate  corrections in liquidity and financial market conditions to align them with the policy  stance, it is the global outlook which presents the greatest threats to growth with  stability in India.  The conduct of monetary policy must ensure that the gains of  strong macroeconomic performance are not lost in the cross currents of global  financial markets and the periodic episodes of volatility of turbulence which have  world wide ramifications.  It is in this context that the Reserve Bank has reinforced  the emphasis on price stability and financial stability in the first quarter review with a  view to supporting growth by contributing stability.  To sum up, therefore, inflation  risks and potential dangers of financial market turbulence dominate the  macroeconomics of current policy assessment.       III. The Policy Response   The operating framework of monetary management is rendered complex,  particularly in  a developing economy such as ours which is undergoing significant  financial deepening and structural change. The relationship between real economy   12variables such as GDP growth and monetary aggregates is subject to constant  change. Similarly, the relationships between different monetary aggregates  themselves  such as broad money (M ),  narrow money (M ) and reserve money  3 1 (M ) is also subject to continuous change. It is for this reason that we have to  0 operate policy flexibly, leading to some impressions of lack of transparency. Our  overall job is to maintain price stability in the presence of the existing scenario of  welcome accelerated growth, along with the maintenance of financial stability of the  system. It is our firm judgement that low and stable inflation is essential to  maintenance of the growth process and we are determined to achieve this continuing  goal. Similarly, in a low income country such as ours, we also believe that the ability  of market participants, ranging from far flung subsistence farmers to the ultra  sophisticated financial market players, such as you, is much more varied than in a  developed country. The costs of risks unfolding are asymmetric, so we have to place  a higher weight on the maintenance of financial stability than in a developed country,  as we pursue overall growth and associated financial market development.    The stance of monetary policy in the first quarter review assigns a higher  priority for managing appropriate liquidity in the financial markets while maintaining  the intensive vigil on price and financial stability.  The Reserve Bank has articulated  its approach to liquidity management in the form of appropriate use of CRR  stipulations, open market operations including MSS and LAF and all policy  instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.    In view of the surplus conditions in the financial markets, the ceiling on daily  reverse repos under the LAF has been removed.  The objective is to absorb excess  liquidity and align overnight rates with the prevailing monetary policy stance so that  policy signals are efficiently and transparently passed through into the structure of  interest rates, aggregate demand and thereby, growth and stability. The restoration  of the informal LAF corridor should help in stabilising overnight rates and smoothing  volatility.  The key policy rates have been kept unchanged.  The cash reserve ratio  has been raised by 50 basis points to 7 per cent in the first quarter review with a  view to impounding liquidity generated by excessive deposit growth in the banking  system.  The CRR is expected to work in conjunction with the restoration of the LAF  corridor to ensure appropriate liquidity conditions in the economy.  The policy stance  will be under careful and continuous review and the mix of instruments will be   13modulated by the evolving situation.  To reflect the Reserve Banks point of view at  the present time, the stance of policy for the period ahead has been enunciated as:            To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and well-anchored inflation  expectations while ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment that supports  export and investment demand in the economy so as to enable continuation of the  growth momentum.                To re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions in financial markets for  securing macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability while simultaneously  pursuing greater credit penetration and financial inclusion.             To respond swiftly with all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving  global and domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability  and the growth momentum.     Once again, I congratulate Shri Bhatt and the State Bank of India for  organising this extremely useful and illuminating workshop.      Thank you.     14
