Restructuring of the Public Finances and• •Macro-economic StabilityMr. Chairman and friends,This meeting has been convened to solicit views on one of the specific references to theEleventh Finance Commission, viz., means by which the Union (or Centre) and the Statesmay bring about restructuring of the public finances so as to restore the budgetarybalance and maintain macro-economic stability. I will, therefore, confine myself to thistheme, in the context of reform process under way. I will, first, describe what may becalled the new realities relevant to current macro-economic management. Then somespecifics relating to devolution mechanisms and macro-economic issues could beconsidered. Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) initiatives in this context will be brieflylisted. I will conclude with comments on specific issues on which some participants inthis meeting have expressed strong views.1. With increasing integration between the Indian and world economy, in terms of tradeand financial flows and especially private external capital flows, we have to recognise theneed for some sort of convergence of macro-economic stability parameters. Most criticalare, fiscal deficit and within it revenue deficit and especially monetised deficit, inflationand of course interest rates. So, we should consider world trends in say, inflation andfiscal deficit, public sector savings and compare our performance in this respect to judgehow competitive we stand in terms of stability and efficiency indicators. While we mayafford to be out of alignment temporarily, or marginally, or with reference to one or twoof the parameters, we will find it difficult to maintain macro stability if we are too faraway on most of them, especially, on the inflation and fiscal deficit front. Today, fiscaland monetary options are no longer driven by domestic compulsions alone ; they have tobroadly conform to certain internationally acceptable norms of what constitutes the soundfundamentals of an open and competitive economy. I do not think we have much optionlong-run.2. The challenges for fiscal restructuring also stem from several domestic factors.Reforming the financial sector to augment efficiency in financial intermediation isinevitable. Further intensification of financial sector reforms means development of organised and efficient debt market, which cannot be realised without strengtheningfiscal consolidation and addressing legal, institutional and technology issues. Hence,limiting the fiscal deficit of Centre and States to a sustainable level is critical for furtherprogress in financial sector reform. This will facilitate further liberalisation of regulationrelating to banks’ investment in government securities and promotion of a more orderlygrowth of debt market. Fiscal discipline is a precondition for successful financial sector• As desired by Eleventh Finance Commission, outline of presentation made by Dr.Y.V.Reddy to theCommission in the meeting of select economists on December 4, 1998, at New Delhi. The presentationdoes not necessarily represent the RBI’s views.

Incidentally, the concept of public sector deficit which includes governmentdeficit including those of public-enterprises’, loses, technically, its significance whenmany enterprises get into diversified (government and public) ownership patterns orbeing privatised, and when they start operating purely on commercial lines. However,there is an implicit government guarantee in respect of borrowings by any publicenterprise, and thus the magnitude of public sector deficit also needs to be reckoned.3. There is now an increasing  about the importance of monetary policy, andthe autonomy in conduct of monetary policy as well as efficiency in monetarytransmission mechanism and these require drastic reduction in the currently ruling highlevel of government borrowing – which again has a significant bearing on fiscal andrevenue deficits.4. Economic reform in a broader sense would also encompass realigning of relativefunctions of Centre and States towards achieving economic prosperity and improving thequality of life. In our context, it means greater emphasis on development of socialinfrastructure and physical infrastructure. Most of the social, and a significant part ofphysical infrastructure lies in the domain of States compared to Centre. Expenditureresponsibility of States is likely to grow in social sectors; particularly education, health,sanitation and nutrition, even after reckoning with some unbundling as also scope forprivate provision. Economic reform is not sustainable if expenditure of StateGovernments is not buoyant in desired directions and this has a bearing on verticaldistribution of resources.5. On the inter-state plane, the new reality is greater role for market based resources fordevelopment of a State. So, while States need to be encouraged to compete for resourcesin the market, there should exist mechanisms in transfer of resources which woulddifferentiate between ability-consistent efforts and the ability–enhancing efforts. By this Imean States which already have a reasonably developed institutional support base andstrong fiscal position can garner resources from market and consequently reduce theirdependence on central transfers. In States where institutional setting is underdeveloped,public policies may have to address the issue of improving their ability to access financialmarkets, while at the same time augmenting their resource base through transfers to helpprepare them towards a greater degree of self-sufficiency. This has greater relevance now6. Against the backdrop of new constitutional provisions relating to giving financialautonomy and responsibilities to local bodies and its inclusion as terms of reference forthe first time for Eleventh Finance Commission, the issues of inter-state and intra-statetransfers have assumed a new dimension. In this context, there is an increasing referenceto Municipal bonds as a means of financing urban infrastructure, especially against thebackdrop of recommendations of the Rakesh Mohan Committee. To the extent theseproposals involve guarantees by State Governments, they affect State finances andprovide expediency to state level reforms, and to the extent there is a demand forcounting them as approved securities for SLR, it has a bearing on interest rate structureand monetary and debt management policies. Our objective is to reduce statutorythan before due to market orientation and has a bearing on equity/horizontal distribution.realisation3preemptions. The Central and State enterprises should, therefore, be encouraged to accessmarket on the basis of financial strength and viability rather than through sops like taxbenefits and SLR routes which distorts the interest rate structure and hampers market7. On fiscal deficit situation, we have to be concerned about the total liabilities ofgovernments, rather than marketable debt alone, since this has dynamic and spiralingconsequences for fiscal policy and its future sustainability, involves a signaling effect forthe market, and is important from the view point of the focus of rating agencies. Whilemarket liabilities would include public debt and contingent liabilities due to guarantees,8. Against the backdrop of Asian crisis, a new reality in the sphere of management offinancial risk for the economy is the need to recognise and monitor off-balance sheetliabilities, whether these are due to banks or Governments. In this context, the guaranteesgiven by the State Governments and Central Government, will have to be assessed andmonitored. The focus on such guarantees has increased recently in the context ofattracting private sector and foreign investment in infrastructure, especially when costrecovery systems are not fully in place. Managing these guarantees can pose difficultproblems at a time when exchange rate is fluctuating and the guaranteed amount ispushing up the external liabilities, as for example, in the case of power projects. Anothernon-transparent way of assuming liability by the Government is to issue letters ofcomfort which do have the same effect as guarantees for the rating purpose and for thesustainability of government finances, though such letters of comfort may not be reported9. We have to be also aware of new realities in the Government borrowing Let me draw attention to two critical issues in the government market borrowingprogramme. One is the increasing cost of Government borrowings, and the other, theshortening of maturities. Both affect the debt management and monetary policyobjectives. While the former is related to the size of the borrowing and hence the fiscaldeficit, the latter is influenced by the future policy uncertainties, particularly relating tofiscal policy, and consequently the market preference for short-term government papersto ward off long-term interest rate risk. What is therefore important is a dynamicallyconsistent fiscal policy with emphasis on low fiscal deficit. Another source of high costfund for the Government is borrowing through the tax-savings and relief bonds, apart from public sector undertaking bonds, which not onlyaffect the overall cost to Government but operate as wrong benchmarks for other markets.These schemes may need a thorough review if we have to move away from dependenceon captive borrowing sources towards retailing of Government securities to a larger10. Abolition of ad hoc treasury bills and introduction of the scheme of Ways and MeansAdvances for the Centre is a major development, impinging on both development ofGovernment securities market and fiscal discipline, including quality of cash and debtmanagement.

Finally, in consonance with the Narasimham Committee–II recommendations, wehave introduced risk weights for Government securities for the purpose of assessingcapital requirement for the banking system and provisioning norms for unhonouredguarantees as essential measures to promote soundness of financial sector. This couldimply greater caution on the part of banks in supporting Government borrowing orgranting advances against guarantees. Incidentally, the share of banks in total financialintermediation, and that of public sector banks in total banking system are likely to comedown in the medium term. Hence, the extent of what may be called captive investors forGovernment securities, could be proportionately less in both formal and informal terms.This has implications for the interest rate in funding a high level of fiscal deficit of and states.12. As part of economic reform, substantial restructuring of public enterprises has beentaking place both at Centre and States and this is likely to be intensified in future. Suchrestructuring has often meant some immediate financial costs, especially when there islarge scale rescheduling of debt, and conversion of debt into equity. These measuresamount to impact of not several hundreds but several thousands of crore. There is apotential for serious erosion of quality of assets. This aspect requires intensive analysisfor designing a suitable approach to restructuring and it is as important as an approach toprivatisation in terms of its dynamic impact on government finances.Macro-economic Issues1. In the light of the new realities described, revenue and expenditure assessments by thecommission should reflect the broad macro-economic concerns of reducing the revenueand fiscal deficit of the combined Government sector. This may require working towardsa consensus on the desirable path of fiscal deficit of 2. While fixing the target levels of fiscal deficits for the combined Government sector,some redistribution of revenue deficits and perhaps even creation of revenue surpluswould be needed. This poses a critical task of devising a balancing mechanism by theEleventh Finance Commission. The major element here would be the incentive system,which needs to be built into the devolution mechanism for transfer of resources. TenthFinance Commission provided a weight of ten per cent for tax effort in its devolutionformula. This may need some review. Also, a revisit to the issue of unutilised taxpotential in the States, tax capacities etc. may be worthwhile. Given the importance ofcost recovery of expenditure, an analysis could be made to see if we could build some3. A ‘totality’ view of fiscal and financial sector interaction is absolutely essential, in thecontext of new realities that have been described. What we have to keep in mind is thesignaling effect that the Commission’s fiscal recommendations would have on thereasonable incentives for promoting fiscal performance of states.Centre and States.centre5financial markets. If there is a clear and credible indication of fiscal consolidation by theEleventh Finance Commission, it will help smoothening the movements in long-terminterest rates. Now, with the growing size of gross and net borrowings of Centre andStates, persistent combined revenue deficits, and cut in capital expenditures, borrowingcosts to Government remain high and sticky. The Eleventh Finance Commission’srecommendations can help change the market expectations through the adoption of a4. While the Finance Commission deals basically with horizontal and vertical equity inresource sharing arrangement, incentives for tax-effort, and perhaps even cost-recoveryissues, one can raise the question of incentive framework in expenditure allocations also.If education and health are critical for reform, and if the assignment of resources is basedon the assumption of increased outlays to such sectors, how do we ensure that theassumption is realised? How should we devise transfer mechanisms that ensure allocationand performance in these sectors? In a way, this is stretching the point, but it is worthRBI’s Initiatives1. RBI has been taking initiatives, in multiple capacities, viz., as monetary authority, asdebt-manager of Centre and States, and as banker to Centre and States. There is anoverlap, and for that matter even conflict, in discharge of these three functions. Hence, itis difficult to pigeonhole RBI’s initiatives. For the present purpose, let me allude to someof the efforts we have taken to improve the quality of information, analysis, and2. RBI has been expressing its views in its Annual Reports on the issue of governmentborrowings. A specific proposal on putting a ceiling on public debt has also beensuggested in a technical paper on the subject published in the RBI Bulletin (December1997).3. Initiatives have been taken to bring about reconciliation between interests of some wellmanaged States and others in imparting market orientation to State borrowings, in theabsence of progress on State Funding Corporation earlier advocated by the RBI.Currently, a State has an option to access market borrowings outside the tranche of allStates, to the extent of 5 to 35 per cent of annual borrowing 4. A scheme for consolidated Sinking Fund has been designed by the RBI as amechanism to ensure orderly retirement of market debt, although only a few States haveresponded 5. In recognition of the emerging problems relating to guarantees, we have constituted aWorking Group whose Report is due soon.

RBI is separately, studying the implications of management of public account forfinances of governments.7. RBI has been taking active interest in developing Government securities market, interms of policy (elimination of ad hoc Treasury Bills), instruments (Treasury Bills ofvarying  and innovative instruments in dated securities), institutionaldevelopment (Primary Dealers and Satellite Dealers), technology (screen based) and legal8. RBI is constantly improving interactions with Governments, as for example, throughrecently constituted Cash and Debt Management Group with the Central Government,and two meetings with State Finance Secretaries conducted recently. The interaction isalso continuing through ad hoc 9. RBI publishes data and analysis in its weekly and monthly Bulletins, which areavailable at website on an adequate and regular basis. The Report on Currency andFinance and the Annual Report provide the Bank’s analysis of government finances andthe policy priorities in this sector. There is an annual study of State Finances published inRBI Bulletin, which carries a wealth of information on state finances.10. RBI has been conducting policy intensive research studies on fiscal and other macro-economic issues through its Development Research Group (DRG) wing and through themedium of its research journal, viz.; Occasional Papers, which are available for widerpublic dissemination. Moreover, the bank provides active research support toGovernment, Planning Commission and other national institutions on public financeissues. Recently, we have initiated a DRG study on the implications of fiscal deficit formacro-economic stability which should be of use to the Eleventh Finance Commission.As requested by the Commission, we will take up analysis of specific subjects in thisstudy and make it available to the Commission in view of the Eleventh FinanceComments on Specific IssuesA number of issues have been flagged in this meeting by the eminent economists andeconomic administrators and I agree with most of what has been said especially on theimportance of cost-recovery for commercial services rendered by government, especiallyin sectors of power, water and road transport. There were strong and somewhat divergentviews on the relevance of fiscal deficit, importance of public ownership, advantages ofdecentralisation, transparency in tax-expenditures and on the issue of insensitivity tomarket related interest rates. I will briefly give my views on each of these.1. On the issue of fiscal deficit, what level of fiscal deficit is sustainable is contextual -depends entirely on the context, including in particular, the level of domestic savings,especially financial savings of households, the level of Current Account deficit, theacceptable level of inflation and, of course, the rate of economic growth. More than size,what is important is how fiscal deficit is financed and for what purposes it is used. If it isCommission’s appreciation of research capabilities available in the RBI.groups.changes (Public Debt Act, SCR Act, Stamp Duty etc.).maturities7financed by large order of monetisation, it has adverse implications for inflation with alag. This has been an empirical fact for us. Dr. C. Rangarajan, our former Governor, hasmade research based observations on this phenomenon in our country. As regards use, tothe extent it is used for financing revenue deficit, there would be no return directlyattributable to such expenditures. Further, there is an addition to stock of liabilitieswithout corresponding addition to stock of assets, impinging on future cash flows. On theother hand, if the deficit is used to finance capital expenditures, there is addition to bothstock of assets and liabilities, but even then such a deficit will have negative impact aslong as the direct financial return to Government on addition to stock of assets is less thancost of servicing of additional liabilities. If such expenditures directly compete withprivate investment and if productivity in public sector is demonstrably lower than that ofprivate sector in the same activity, there would be a further negative impact. To the extentthere is funding of public investment out of such a deficit with clear complementarity toprivate investments, it is possible that deficiency in direct return is made up by increasein indirect returns. One aspect often ignored by economists advocating large fiscaldeficits to fund public investment is the expectations on the part of potential creditors,domestic or foreign, that borrowed funds are indeed used for genuinely productivepurpose. It is not merely the advocacy or promise of productive use of funds butexpectations of creditors about such productive use that becomes important if‘preemption’ is reduced. The sustainable or defensible level of fiscal deficit should beviewed in the current context of mode of financing and use of funds in Centre and States.Sometimes, it is argued that increased fiscal deficit would help stimulate demand andshould not be eschewed. But the issue really is whether this is a sustainable course tofollow in the medium to long term. Year-to-year variations may be desirable from theview point of counter-cyclical objectives of fiscal policy but only within the objective ofmedium-term sustainability. The desirability or otherwise cannot, therefore, be settled inabstract terms, but only with reference to context.2. On public ownership also, there have been strong views and it cannot be held thatpublic ownership, by itself is inefficient or for that matter relatively more efficient, be itefficiency in technical, allocative or dynamic terms. Contextually, I would suggest, thatthere are three inter-related approaches. First, if on ideological and strategic grounds, anenterprise has to be a public enterprise, 100 per cent owned or 51 per cent , there can beno debate. On instrumentalist grounds, i.e., as an instrument of non-commercialobjective, alternative ownership patterns and optimisation of results could be examined toachieve such non-commercial objectives, provided there is a debate on desirable changes,if any, in market structure also. Third, and in all other cases, a portfolio approach toownership rather than ideological or instrumentalist needs to be considered. In aninvestment portfolio approach, it is not material whether a particular public enterprise iscurrently profit making or loss making or giving high or low returns. For allpredominantly commercial activities, where entry of private enterprise is permitted,portfolio approach appears logical. In a portfolio approach, we can project future cashflows, both with plans for restructuring and without to obtain the Net Present Value. Ifthe present value of anticipated proceeds from privatisation appear to exceed the net assetvalue, with or without restructuring, then privatisation is warranted. The portfolioapproach can factor-in degrees of public ownership and control since restructuring option8includes consideration of degrees of autonomy also. Such a framework can be applied forpublic enterprise in both Centre and States. The real issue is a credible threat ofprivatisation, which in itself will help improve the efficiency of public enterprise in asmuch as management and workforce would be motivated to improve their performancetoward change of ownership. As a result, it is inevitable that a large public enterprisesector will remain, but with greater dynamism. I agree with the view that, a large segmentof public enterprise sector will continue to exist for quite some time because of sheer sizeof public enterprise now. It could also be as a consequence of costly restructuring toavoid privatisation resulting in continued fiscal burden. In my view, effective threat ofprivatisation is useful, resulting in some actual privatisation combined with increasedlevel of efficiency in the public enterprise sector, thus reducing the fiscal burden.3. On the issue of decentralisation, either a conceptual approach or a pragmatic approachis possible. Conceptually, the case for decentralisation in Government can be made whenan optimal distribution of powers and functions between various levels is arrived at and aprocess of decentralisation is warranted to reach the optimum. Further, decentralisation insome aspects or powers could be combined with centralisation in regard to others whilemeeting optimality criterion.In the current debate, there is an impressionistic or anecdotal evidence of need fordecentralisation. Empirically, it can be established, that where Centre and States arecurrently performing same functions (Delhi Electricity or Road Transport), States areseen to be less inefficient both in physical and financial parameters. Quantitative analysisof efficiencies, activity-wise, at Centre/district/municipal/ panchayat could certainly beattempted. I will not be surprised if the results vary as between States, with a distinct tiltin favour of more decentralisation. However, real decentralisation is not possible unlessthe staff is squarely brought under the administrative control of relevant level ofGovernment and democratic process is ensured.4. Transparency in budget, especially quantifying, to the extent possible, and presentingtax-expenditures is certainly worthwhile. Ideally, the Eleventh Finance Commissionshould work on quantifying tax-expenditures in the last five years at Centre and Statelevels, recast their budgets on a proforma basis and consider these as inputs for assessingrevenues and expenditures. There are also related issues of tax exemption of municipalbonds which has been advocated by some. It is no doubt a standard practice in manycountries. In India however, municipal bonds may not sell without State guarantees,which could imply adverse credit worthiness effects for states themselves. Further, whileCentre has been allowing tax exemptions to entities like PSUs for raising resources fromthe market, no such allowance was made for its own securities, till two years ago. Now,some relief on par with mutual funds is available. One clear way of reducing interestburden and encouraging retailing of Government securities would be to review this issue.5. Finally, it has been argued that encouraging borrowing by Government at marketrelated interest rates has not brought about any fiscal discipline since Governments inIndia are not sensitive to interest rates. Hence, it is argued that we need not pursue thiscause. I am afraid I have serious problems with such an approach. At an abstract level,9one can argue that accepting over-sensitivity in these matters as a fact helps none exceptthose who are insensitive. Again, at an abstract level, it can be argued that price has botha demand side and supply side. If the whole of borrowing programme is , then price is immaterial, especially since seigniorage or interest paid byGovernment comes back, as dividend from Reserve Bank to Government of India. Butwhat about costs of monetisation or inflation costs to the economy, which arerecognisably high and distorting? Hence, if government does not pay this price, someoneelse pays it. Even so, ends of transparency of budget operations are not met. We have toseparately reckon such other costs of monetisation. Assuming that there is a mix ofmonetisation and non- monetisation, not charging market related rates on deficit has moral hazard implications. As regards non- monetised part, some crosssubsidisation between the Government and the financial sector becomes inevitable ifinterest rates are not market related. It is true that for this logic to be convincing, marketsneed be developed, but developing markets and gradually adopting market related ratesserve the longer term interests of efficiency and any effort in the meantime, to artificiallydepress the cost of borrowings to Government will not be desirable.monetisedtechnicallymonetised
