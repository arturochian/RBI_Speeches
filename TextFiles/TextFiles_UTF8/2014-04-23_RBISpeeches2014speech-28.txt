Framework for the conduct of macroprudential policy   inIndia: experiences and perspectives K C. Chakrab Deputy Governor Reserve Bank ofIndia InIndia, we have a relatively long history of experience with conduct of macroprudential policy.  TheReserveBank has, over the years, attempted to address systemic risks in both its dimensions thetime  dimension or procyclicality, and the cross sectional dimension within a macroprudential framework. The article will review Indias experiences/experiments with macroprudential policy prior to the crisis, during  the crisis and more recently, the experience of using countercyclical policy to address the challenges  posed by a sharp increase in volatility of exchange rates together with a heightened external deficit.  Theuse of macroprudential policy in India has been extensive and multi?faceted spanning the banking  and non?banking financial sector; addressing asset price spirals and credit booms; encompassing capital  flows and systemic liquidity management; dealing with large and complex financial institutions; calibrating  the development of the OTCderivative markets; and tackling interconnectedness in the banking and  financial sector and between the financial and the real sector. The article will also touch upon the institutional arrangements for financial stability inIndia, preandpost  the crisis. Prior to the crisis, no agency was explicitly granted a mandate for financial stability though  the Reserve Bank acted as the implicit systemic regulator. Post crisis, institutional arrangements have  been strengthened with the setting up of an inter?agency Financial Stability and Development Council. The article will finally attempt to present the lessons emanating from Indias experience with operationalising  a macroprudential policy framework, especially with regard to some of the major emerging questions  signal extraction, use of rules versus discretion in policy making, coordination with other policy  segments (primarily monetary policy), assessing the impact of the policy measures, etc. It will then touch  upon someof the challenges, viz. developing a framework for systemic risk assessment, assessing and  plugging data gaps, and also focus on the challenges for extending the scope of macroprudential policy  beyond thefinancial sector to the corporate sector, specifically for managing risks arising out of corporate  leverage and unhedged foreign exchange exposures, and to the sovereigns.

Housing loan growth Total bank credit growth  Source: RBI. Box Framework for systemic risk assessment  A number of initiatives have been taken to improve the financial stability analytics inRBI. Some of these are outlined below.  Stability indicators and maps  Stability indicators and maps represent coincident indicators of systemic stress in the financial system. Theyare  constructed by aggregating information from different segments of the overall financial system and encapsulating the  information in a single statistic which measures the current state of instability in the financial system.  RBIhas been using a variety of stability maps and indicators to assess trends in risk dimensions of various aspects of  the macrofinancial system the banking sector, the macroeconomy, financial markets, the corporate sector, etc. Eachof  these indicators is based on contemporaneous developments in different risk factors. A systemic liquidity indicator has  also been developed to gauge the degree of stress in domestic liquidity conditions and to establish time frames for  potential extreme events.  Banking stability measures and expected shortfall  Banking stability measures, a cross?sectional econometric framework, capture the distress dependencies among  financial firms using stock price data and attempt to estimate the contribution of individual firms to systemic risk.  Abanking stability index is calculated, which captures the expected number of banks to become distressed given that  at least one bank has become distressed. Separate toxicity and vulnerability indices capture distress between specific  institutions while the cascade effect attempts to measure the distress in the system associated with the distress of a  specific institutions. This method is also being used for estimation of expected shortfall of assets of banking system  inresponse to a large negative shock.  / Macroprudential policies: implementation and interactions  Banque de FranceFinancial Stability Review No.18 April 2014 141 ardwforgoinghallengescFramework for the conduct of macroprudential policy in India: experiences and perspectives  Kamalesh C.Chakrabarty Network analysis  The techniques of network modelling have been used to develop a bespoke financial network analysis and contagion  stresstesting platform for theIndian financial system. The analysis primarily looks into the interconnections that exists  between different institutions in the financial system and tries to identify the build?up of systemic risks. Graphical network  representations have been developed which are being used to assess the degree of system level interconnectedness  and the stability of the system. A contagion simulator helps in assessing the possible loss of capital to the financial  system due to a random failure of one or more financial institutions. Both the solvency and liquidity effects of failure  ofa financial entity are assessed. Macrofinancial stress tests  RBI conducts a variety of macro stresstesting exercises at regular periodicities. The first set of stresstesting exercises  uses multivariate regression tools to evaluate the impact of a particular macroeconomic variable on the asset quality of  banks and their capital adequacy ratio at the system level. The second set is based on a vector autoregressive(VAR)  model which assesses the impact of the overall economic stress situation on the asset quality and capital adequacy  of the banking system taking into account the feedback effect of the macroeconomic performance of the economy on  banksstability. Thethird set uses quantile regression techniques to model system level slippage ratio with macrovariables  in the tails. Multivariate regressions and panel regressions are also used for projections/stresstesting for various sector  as well as at bank group level. Inorder to improve the assessment of projectedNPAs on the capital, a model based on time series econometric tool  has been developed to project profit of banks under different macroeconomic scenarios. The projected values of the  ratio of the non?performing advances are translated into capital ratios using the balance sheet approach, by which  capital in the balance sheet is affected via the provisions and net profits. 4|2 Managing risks arising out of corporate  There are, however, clear challenges in developing  leverage and un?hedged foreign  a robust analytical framework for conduct of  macroprudential policy.
