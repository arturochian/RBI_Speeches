I thank Professor Murthy for inviting me to share my thoughts with a young 
audience in an institution which has a formidable reputation in agricultural research as 
having pioneered the “Green Revolution”.  In my talk today, I propose to briefly 
outline the economic and financial structure of the State as well as highlight various 
financial inclusion initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank.  I will then indicate a few 
policy challenges in sustaining the growth momentum.  I conclude with some 
thoughts on the agricultural economy.   
I will trace the economic development starting from the early 2000s mainly 
th
because Uttarakhand was instituted in 2000 as the 27 State of the Republic of India. 
The State known as the abode of gods is truly a paradise for nature lovers and 
adventure sports endowed with the natural bounty of glaciers, rivers and forests.   It is 
one of the thinly populated States accounting for 1.6 per cent of the total geographical 
area of the country and 0.8 per cent of the national population.  Located in the 
foothills of the Himalayas, Uttarakhand’s terrain and agro-climatic conditions 
obviously provide   unique challenges as well as opportunities for growth and 
development.  
Macroeconomic Trends  
In the 2000s, the Indian economy witnessed acceleration in economic growth.  
It is noteworthy that the State registered even higher growth thus emerging as one of 
the fastest growing states in India (Chart 1).

The growth acceleration in the State was also reflected in the per capita income 
which increased by 168 per cent from 19,457 in 2001-02 to 52,125 by 2011-12.  
The increase in the State per capita income was much sharper as compared to the all- 
India per capita income which increased by 81 per cent from 20,943 to 37,851 
during the same period (Chart 2).  This enabled the State to significantly improve its 
th th
rank among the 28 states from 17 to 10 during the same period. 
 
The growth impulses in the initial phase during 2001-08 emanated mainly from 
industry and services.   In the latter phase of 2009-12, growth was driven by the 
services sector.  However, in both the phases agricultural growth remained low and 
volatile (Chart 3).

 Reflecting the divergence in sectoral growth trends, the contribution of 
agriculture to the gross state domestic product (GSDP) declined while that of industry 
and services sectors rose (Chart 4).  It is noteworthy that the growth of industrial 
sector in the State has been significant despite the constraints of the terrain and 
topography.

An analysis of the trends at a more disaggregate level suggests that growth was 
led by manufacturing, construction and trade & hotels (Chart 5).

The composition of the labour force mirrored the composition of GSDP.   The 
share of employment in agriculture at 33 per cent remained significantly lower than 
the national average of around 52 per cent.   The share of construction, trade and 
manufacturing in the labour force remained higher compared to the national average 
(Table 1).  However, labour force participation rate at around 47 per cent in 2010-11 
was lower than the labour participation rate of 53 per cent at the national level 
indicating higher level of unemployment in the State.

The share of informal sector in employment generation in the State is very 
minimal as compared with other states (Chart 7).  Hence, the development of the 
informal sector is important as it could help harness the demographic dividend 
bestowed on the State. The informal sector can also play a significant role in 
improving credit absorption.    
 
The standards of life indicators for the State compare favourably with the 
national average.  The share of households having access to basic civic amenities such 
as safe drinking water and electricity was relatively high compared to the national 
average.  Similarly ownership of household assets such as television, telephone and 
mechanised personal transport was higher than the national average.  The population 
5 
 of households having banking facility was also higher than the national average 
(Table 2).

  Notwithstanding the economic growth and better access to amenities, the State 
lags behind in certain human development aspects. Despite high literacy and high per 
capita income, there is high incidence of poverty and life expectancy rate is lower as 
1
compared with the national average.   The State ranked 14 among the 23 StatesF F in 
terms of Human Development Index 2007-08 (Chart 8).

Per cent/ActualsFiscal Trends  
The State has initiated various fiscal reforms which include implementation of 
VAT, enactment of fiscal responsibility legislation, introduction of a new pension 
scheme, imposition of ceiling on guarantees and constitution of consolidated sinking 
fund and guarantee redemption fund. Under the rule based fiscal framework, fiscal 
position of the State witnessed improvement and the State achieved revenue surplus in 
2006-07. Gross fiscal deficit as a ratio to GSDP also declined to 2.4 per cent in 2006-
07.  However, declining trend in revenue receipts coupled with increase in 
expenditure turned revenue account into deficit during 2009-10.  With the 
improvement in overall macroeconomic conditions, the State has resumed the process 
of fiscal correction.  While revenue account turned surplus during 2011-12 (RE), 
GFD-GSDP ratio has increased due to higher capital outlay (Table 3).

Financial Indicators  
  The level of financial development is critical for driving higher economic 
growth. The formal financial system in India is dominated by banks and same is the 
case with Uttarakhand.   The average population per bank branch in the State was 
favourable at 7,300 in March 2012 as compared to all-India average of 12,700.    
Though the banking penetration is relatively high compared to all- India, there is 
7 
 considerable scope for increasing coverage given the dispersed nature of villages 
(Chart 9).

  The credit deposit (C-D) ratio of the State at 34.2 per cent in December 
2011was significantly lower than the C-D ratio   at the all-India level of 75.7 per cent.  
Though the C-D Ratio of the State has shown signs of improvement in recent years, it 
still significantly lags behind the all-India average underscoring the scope for further 
credit penetration  (Chart 10).

 Another measure of credit intensity is the ratio of bank credit to the GSDP 
which is low in the State compared to all-India level indicating the need for further 
credit expansion (Chart 11).

Not only is the overall C-D ratio low but also there is considerable variability 
across districts (Chart 12).  The wide disparities in the distribution of credit indicate 
that greater attention is needed to enhance availability of financial services in the hill 
regions of the State.

At the disaggregated activity level, the share of agricultural credit was 
relatively low with considerable inter-district variability (Chart 13).  Agriculture 
being the main livelihood for the hill districts, the uneven distribution of credit across 
the districts is not conducive to inclusive growth.

Financial Inclusion   
Against this background, let me now turn to the financial inclusion strategy of 
the Reserve Bank and what are the specific steps taken for Uttarakhand? It is 
important to bring the poor and under-privileged sections of the society within the 
banking fold for inclusive growth. In this context, our recent financial inclusion drive 
has four key elements.   
First, provision of a set of basic financial products and services for the 
vulnerable and financially excluded sections.  This includes a savings cum overdraft 
product in the form of no-frills account, and entrepreneurial credit in the form of 
Kisan Credit Card (KCC)/General Credit Card (GCC) (Table 4). 
Second, spread of financial literacy across all sections of the society by 
creating awareness about financial products and services among the population.  
Third, greater regulatory incentives through liberalisation of interest rates and 
branch licensing.  Banks have been given complete freedom to price their advances so 
that lending in the rural areas could be a commercial proposition.  Given the lower 
penetration of formal credit and recourse to money lenders what matters is the 
availability of credit rather than the cost.  Banks have also been given the freedom to 
open branches in centres with population of less than 1,00,000.

Uttar KashiFourth, use of technology and innovative delivery models so that the cost for 
providing large quantum of small-ticket transactions could be brought down. This 
initiative included putting in place a system of Business Correspondent (BC) Model to 
provide door-step delivery of financial products and services by authorized agents of 
banks; and Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) for routing of payments of the central 
and state government welfare schemes like social security pensions, Mahatma Gandhi 
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), National Old Age 
Pension Scheme (NOAPS) directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.  
In this direction, the effort so far has been to make basic banking facility 
available to all villages with a population of over 2,000 by end-March 2012. The 
progress in banking coverage over the last two years has indeed been substantial.  The 
next step is to provide banking facilities with population below 2000.  State Level 
Bankers Committees (SLBCs) are preparing roadmaps for banking facilities in these 
villages in a time bound manner.  For meaningful financial inclusion, it is envisaged 
that banks would set up brick and mortar branches in a cluster of 8–10 BC units in a 
reasonable distance of 3–4 kilometers.

Financial Inclusion in Uttarakhand 
Banks in Uttarakhand have made provision for banking facilities in 226 
identified villages having population of more than 2000 by March 2012.  Of these, 18 
villages are covered through bricks and mortar branches, 198 villages through 
appointment of BCs and 10 through kiosks.   
 Furthermore, the State Government has identified 259 clusters of small 
villages as Nyaypanchayats, of which 108 were provided with banking facilities and 
the rest 151 will be covered during 2012-13. Further, 743 villages with the population 
between 1000 and 2000 have been identified for provision banking facilities in 2012-
13.  
12 
 By June 2012, 8.6 lakh no-frill accounts were opened.  During 2011-12, 1.2 
lakh KCCs and 1200 GCCs were issued and 2600 SHGs were formed.  Out of the 13 
districts 10 have FLCCs.    
In addition, the Reserve Bank has initiated a campaign of financial inclusion 
through outreach programmes by the executives of the Bank to have grassroots level 
understanding of accessibility of financial services and to promote financial inclusion.  
I will be visiting Mayarampur near Nanital tomorrow for the outreach programme.  
Policy Challenges 
Let me now turn to a few broader macroeconomic policy challenges for the 
development planning in the State. 
First, there is a need to promote diversification in agriculture consistent with 
the agro-climatic conditions.  It will help to address regional disparity and facilitate 
poverty alleviation. Agricultural growth needs to be supported by adequate storage, 
warehousing and marketing facilities which will generate employment in the informal 
sector. 
  Second, initiatives need to be taken to promote sustainable industrial 
development compatible with the unique bio-diversity of the State which in turn could 
generate local employment and reduces migration. Since the State is rich in water 
resources, there is a comparative advantage in developing the hydro-electric sector in 
an environmentally sustainable manner.   
Third, there is a need to bridge the infrastructure deficit in the State with the 
active participation of the private sector. Better infrastructure will enable harnessing 
the tourism potential.  Identified tourist zones can be connected by better quality roads 
besides exploring the possibilities of providing air links over the medium-term.     
Fourth, the high level of literacy provides opportunity for further growth 
through knowledge-based industries.  It is, therefore, important to set up quality 
higher learning and professional education centres to provide knowledge-workers. 
13 
 Fifth, there is, a need to improve credit culture where banks can explore 
innovative customized business models with a greater emphasis on group lending.  
This in turn could help reduce inequality in credit distribution.   
Sixth, the financial sector in the State is dominated by commercial banks. 
Hence, the spread of banking services is important for greater economic activity. In 
this context, the quantitative achievement of banking coverage reflected in increase in 
no-frills accounts need to be converted into meaningful financial inclusion by active 
loan and deposit transactions in these accounts. The geographical peculiarities of the 
State along with small size of scattered settlements make it difficult for physical 
location of branches. Therefore, emphasis can be placed on mobile branches with 
greater reliance on information technology.  In this process, all the stake-holders - 
banks, the State Government and the Reserve Bank - need to work in close co-
ordination: banks by ensuring that the BCs are active and by gradually increasing the 
number of branches in the unbanked areas; the State Government by ensuring that 
social benefit transfers progressively take place through bank accounts; and the 
Reserve Bank by effective monitoring and active co-ordination of the financial 
inclusion action plan in the State. 
 Conclusion 
I briefly reviewed the recent economic and financial developments in 
Uttarakhand and made a few suggestions for sustainable inclusive growth.  Let me 
conclude with some thoughts on the agricultural economy as this university has been 
the cradle of technological breakthrough in agriculture.   
As we discussed, there has been a sharp drop in the share of agriculture in the 
national as well as in the State GDP.  However, 52 per cent of our work force and 69 
per cent of the population at the national level are still dependent on agriculture 
directly or indirectly for livelihood. Hence, agricultural growth is central to inclusive 
sustainable overall growth.  However, stagnation in agriculture is increasingly 
emanating as a major constraint to growth.  This has manifested itself in several ways: 
low productivity and high volatility in production across crops, low per capita 
availability of food products as well as high and persistent food inflation.   
14 
 The geo-climatic conditions have also changed with more frequent visitation of 
natural calamities on a wider global stake. As the net cultivable area of 142 million 
hectares in the country is not likely to increase, the gain in food production will have 
to be met by increasing productivity. In this context, there is a need for another wave 
of technological breakthrough in developing short-duration drought-resistant high 
yielding seeds not only for cereals but also pulses and oilseeds.  Given the fragmented 
land holding pattern in the country, it is also important to develop appropriate 
technology for small farm size.  There is also a need for developing better farming 
practices in horticulture, poultry, dairy and fishery, the consumption of which is going 
to increase substantially.  In this endeavour, agricultural scientists and leaders like you 
have an important role in ushering in another Green Revolution for which this 
university has prided itself.
