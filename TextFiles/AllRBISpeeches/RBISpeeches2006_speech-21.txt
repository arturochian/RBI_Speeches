1Asian Perspective on Growth: Outlook for IndiaDistinguished friends,I am delighted to be here at the G30's International Banking Seminarhosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Indeed, it is an honour andprivilege to be amidst the global Gurus of financial world. I divide my humblepresentation into five parts: namely the contours of Indian economy; the majorchallenges facing the Indian economy; the impact of global imbalances on India;some not easily quantifiable strengths of India and; India's growing economicrelations with Asia.Contours of Indian Economy• The Indian economy has been growing at an average annual growth rate ofnearly 6 per cent since the 1980s, and at over 8 per cent during the last threeyears. A Draft Approach Paper to the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-08 to2011-12) suggests that the economy can grow between 8 and 9 per cent peryear.• India has also shown considerable resilience during the recent years andavoided adverse contagion impact of several shocks.• The inflation rate has been low and stable since the mid-1990s moderating toaround 5 per cent per annum. The common intention of the Government andthe Reserve Bank of India is to maintain annual inflation below 5 per cent inthe medium term.• We see a consistent increase in gross domestic investment rate from 23.0 percent of GDP in 2001-02 to 30.1 per cent in 2004-05. The gross domesticsaving rate has also improved from 23.6 per cent to 29.1 per cent over thesame period, contributed by a significant turn around in public sector saving.• The productivity of capital use, as measured by the Incremental CapitalOutput Ratio (ICOR), has been high by Asian standards and is showingdownward trend reflecting improvement in productivity growth as well as moreintensive use of existing capacity. This point to prospects for sustained highgrowth in future, given the existing level of investment in the economy,coupled with upward trend in domestic savings.• A noteworthy development during the recent years has been the continuedrecovery in manufacturing sector. This has been supported by domestic aswell export demand, increased capacity utilization, augmentation of capacitiesand improvements in private business and consumer confidence.• The services sector accounts for 60 per cent of GDP and has been growing at9 per cent per annum since the mid-1990s, with potential for creating jobs andgenerating additional income.• There has been a significant decline in the poverty ratio during the 1990s asreflected in the latest survey of 2004-05 by the National Sample SurveyOrganisation. The growth performance and potential augurs well for                                                1 Address by  Dr. Y.V.Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the G30's International BankingSeminar  on September 18, 2006 hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in Singapore.1addressing concerns relating to disguised unemployment, seasonalunemployment and underemployment in the years ahead.• The fiscal position of the Government, both central and States, is undergoingconsolidation in terms of targeted reduction in fiscal deficit indicators.• The current account deficit (CAD) to GDP ratio has been moderate in India.The current account remained in surplus during 2001-02 to 2003-04, beforeturning into a modest deficit since then. It is expected to continue to be in therange of 2 to 3 per cent under the projected outlook of 8 to 9 per cent growthrate during the Eleventh Five Year Plan. India's foreign exchange reservesnow stand roughly at US $ 165 billion and are well in excess of total externaldebt of the country.• The financial markets, especially the money, government securities and forexmarkets have been nurtured and developed in view of their critical role in thetransmission mechanism of monetary policy.•  The financial sector has acquired greater strength, efficiency and stability bythe combined effect of competition, regulatory measures, policy environmentand motivation among the market players including banks.• The workers enjoy considerable freedom of movement, expression and rights,especially through unionisation which, while making some changes difficult,ensures a vibrancy and timely improvisation to deal with competition.Major Challenges for Sustenance of Indian Growth Process•  First, the poor state of the physical infrastructure, both in terms of quantityand quality. The most important issue here is regulatory framework which isbeing addressed by the Government. Technological developments and rapidenhancement of domestic construction capabilities should aid the process ofspeedy and efficient implementation. Given the healthy fundamentals of thedomestic financial sector and the enhanced interest of foreign investors,funding should not pose any serious problem. One other concern has beenthe cost recovery, which is expected to improve with more public-privatepartnership. There are grounds for optimism for a medium term resolution ofthese issues.• Second, fiscal consolidation. The recent budget of the central governmentbrings the consolidation on track, targeting a gross fiscal deficit of three percent of GDP by 2009 while eliminating revenue (current) deficit. Our studieson State finances in Reserve Bank of India give grounds for optimism inregard to their fiscal health. We recognize two important areas which willresult in fiscal empowerment. One is elimination of subsidies which are notappropriate, and elimination of tax exemptions, which are distortionary. Whilein any polity fiscal consolidation is hard, it is particularly so in our setting, butthere are grounds for optimism.• Third, and perhaps the most challenging issue relates to development ofagriculture. While over 60 per cent of the workforce is dependent onagriculture, the GDP growth generated from agriculture is only marginallyabove the rate of growth of the population, which is not adequate to ensurerapid poverty reduction. To facilitate a more rapid growth in agriculture,legislative, institutional and attitudinal changes to supplement enhanced publicand private investment are needed. There is an increasing recognition of thisissue among policy makers.2• Fourth, there is a need to shift the emphasis to attracting foreign directinvestment, which is less volatile. This requires a more favourable investmentclimate in general both for domestic and foreign capital.• Fifth, delivery of essential public services such as education and health tolarge parts of our population is a major institutional challenge. It is strongly feltthat education will empower the poor to participate in the growth process andthe large gaps in availability of health in terms of minimum access to the poorneeds to be filled.• With rapid growth in manufacturing and services, a sudden and intensepressure has developed in regard to availability and quality of urbaninfrastructure and urban services. A notable beginning has been made in thisdirection with the launching of "National Urban Renewal Mission". Implications of Global Imbalances for India• India has not contributed either positively or negatively in terms of largecurrent account surplus or large current account deficit; saving-investmentshave been by and large balanced; the economy is domestic demand drivenand generally our policies, including exchange rate are market oriented. Thus,India has been following policies which not only served it well but alsocontributed to global stability.• Any large and rapid adjustments in major currencies and related interest ratesor current accounts of trading partners would impact the Indian economythough the impact on India may be less than many other emerging marketeconomies.• India does not depend on the international capital market for financing thefiscal deficit and consequently to some extent adverse consequences of theglobal developments would be muted. However, there could be a spill-overeffect of global developments on domestic interest rates and thus on fisc also.• Any abrupt adjustment in global imbalances may have some impact on thecorporates, banks and households in India though their exposures, inaggregate, to external sector are not huge. With respect to the impact oncorporates, if there is widening of spreads due to a shift in investor confidencein the international markets, those corporates which have borrowed at variablerates may possibly suffer more than those, which have taken loans on a fixedrate basis.• Though, banks' exposure to the risky assets has been severely restricted byReserve Bank’s regulatory actions, should there be a reversal of capital flows,asset prices may decline.  Further, banks in India have invested significantly ingovernment debt and other fixed income securities. If a rise in internationalrates gets reflected in domestic interest rates, banks will have to mark downthe value of their investment portfolio. However, the banking sector hasacquired some added strength to absorb such probable shocks, largely aidedby regulatory actions.•  As regards impact on the households, there is a risk that rise in interest ratesin general could impact the housing market and expose the balance sheet ofthe households to interest rate risk, increasing the risk of loan losses forbanks. The overall banking sector’s exposure to housing loans being relatively3small, adverse developments may not have any systemic implications on thebanking sector.Not Easily Quantifiable Strengths• First, a vast pool of science and technology graduates and the millions whoare familiar with English language are sources of strength for the emergingIndia so far. The familiarity with multiple languages in India prepares thepeople to adapt better to multi-cultural situations, making it easier for them tofit into international systems very smoothly. There is also recognition of theneed to maintain and enhance quality of research and skills.• Second, impressive are the initiatives of many States for empowerment ofwomen which defend their rights and help to gain greater self-esteem andcontrol over their own personal lives and social relationships.• Third, the existence of a free press provides some insurance againstexcesses and makes Governments at all levels more accountable thanotherwise. The recently enacted Right to Information Act has contributed tocredibility of transparency in public policies. Thus, Indian democracy andmedia are active and vital to our nation.• Fourth, the political climate is characterised by what may be termed aspolitical system stability, despite the coalition cabinets and periodic electionsboth at the Centre and several States. As Michael Mandelbaum, a democracyexpert at Johns Hopkins University in Washington said:"There’s a lot of turmoil on the surface of Indian democracy, but there’s alot of consensus deep down in the political system."• Fifth, India will remain one of the youngest countries in the world in the nextfew decades. This "demographic dividend" is seen as an inevitable advantageprovided prerequisites such as skill-upgradation and sound governance torealize it are put in place. More important, the demographic transition is likelyto be stretched over a longer period since States in India are at differentstages of such transition from Kerala to Uttar Pradesh.• Sixth advantage is India’s business culture. In terms of business environment,the impressive growth coupled with market orientation of the economy hasbeen a bottoms-up exercise, with a very broad-based growing entrepreneurialclass.  These tendencies are perhaps reflective of a penchant for innovationamong growing entrepreneurial class in India, imbued with professionalismand seeking to be globally competitive.• Seventh, there is increasing enthusiasm amongst the provincial governmentsto attract foreign investment and hence we can hope that they will be keen toensure physical infrastructure and good governance.Let me conclude with what Mr. Edward Luce who was with the FinancialTimes in India has to say about India in his latest book "Inspite of the Gods: TheRise of Modern India""India is not on autopilot to greatness. But it would take an incompetentpilot to crash the plane"Economic Relations with Asia• China and India are not only helping the global economy in producing low-costgoods and services but are also rapidly growing markets in their own right,4with a huge demand for consumer and capital goods produced all over theworld. In the context of on-going buoyancy in the Asian region and theincreasing trade between developing countries, India's trade relation hasundergone a significant structural change, with developing economies ingeneral and Asia in particular, accounting for a major share of India'smerchandise trade. In terms of non-oil imports, China has become the largesttrading partner for us.• Asia accounts for nearly half of India's foreign trade, excluding oil imports andis growing. Exports to Asia accounted for 46 per cent of India's total exports,while non-oil imports from Asia accounted for 45 per cent of India's total non-oil imports during 2005-06. China has emerged as the third major exportdestination after US and UAE. India's total trade (merchandise exports andnon-oil imports) with Asia has increased from US $ 29 billion in 2000-01 to US$ 91.5 billion in 2005-06, comprising exports at US $ 47.2 billion and non-oilimport at US $ 44.3 billion.• Total trade with the ASEAN (exports plus non-oil imports) has increasedmanifold from US $ 6.7 billion in 2000-01 to US $ 21.1 billion in 2005-06.India's exports to the ASEAN region stood at US $ 10.5 billion and imports atUS $ 10.6 billion during 2005-06.• India has become a formal dialogue partner of ASEAN, and is keen to expandits participation in Southeast Asian and Asia-wide institutions. Similarly, India'strade with SAARC countries which presently stands at about at US $ 6.7billion has vast scope to expand further.• In order to boost regional trade and investment, India has entered intocomprehensive economic cooperation agreements/trade agreements withseveral countries including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand,Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and regional blocks such asASEAN.• Mr. Raymond Lim, Singapore's Minister of Transport and Second Minister ofForeign Affairs, in his article "Creating Globally Connected Asian Community"which appeared in the June 2006 issue of Finance and Development of theIMF notes:"The rise of China and India will redefine regional divisions of labour and tradeand help the Southeast Asian economies take off on a new and higher growthtrajectory. China and India will bring Asia into the center of the global economy.….. The rise of China and India is helping Asia to not only grow but to becomemore integrated."----------------------5
