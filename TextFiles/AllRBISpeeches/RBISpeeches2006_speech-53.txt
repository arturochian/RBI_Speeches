????Financial Inclusion and Millennium Development GoalsAt the outset, I take this opportunity to thank the Planning Commission, theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the College of AgriculturalBanking for inviting me to this very relevant program on human development andState finances.The central theme of the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) is reduction ofpoverty in all its forms. The MDGs emphasise human development indicators,especially those relating to women and children, to enable people to live a life ofdignity. The role of the State in the achievement of the MDGs through fiscalmeasures to increase investment in economic and social capital is primary. Thefinancial system can play a role in reinforcing many of the objectives of theMDGs involving savings, livelihood and economic infrastructure apart fromproviding an efficient payments system. The role of the community basedorganisations and NGOs has been found to be vital in catalysing localparticipation to enhance the efficiency and transparency in the delivery ofservices essential for achievement of human development goals. Thus the StateGovernments, the formal financial system and community based organisationscan be considered as the three pillars in achieving societal transformation.These three pillars perform distinct but mutually reinforcing roles that can havetremendous synergies.By financial inclusion we mean the provision of affordable financial services, viz.,access to payments and remittance facilities, savings, loans and insuranceservices by the formal financial system to those who tend to be excluded. It isimportant to recognise that in the policy framework for development of the formalfinancial system in India, the need for financial inclusion and covering more andmore of the excluded population by the formal financial system has always beenconsciously emphasised. What has now come to the fore is that even afterdecades of such emphasis there are large segments of the society outside thefinancial system. Simultaneously the growth of the NGO and the Self HelpGroups has been significant and their linkage with banks has facilitated greaterfinancial inclusion. These groups are mainly of women and the recovery rates arehigh. There is no subsidy element and the outreach and penetration continues togrow. The coverage is several times that under government sponsored schemes.Where groups have been consciously promoted under government sponsoredschemes, the recovery is just 50 per cent as compared to 90 per cent plusrecovery under the voluntary movement. Furthermore, there are reports thatgroups are promoted under the sponsored programmes just to avail of thesubsidy. It is, therefore, essential that the strengths of the voluntary NGO/SHG                                      ? Speech by Smt. Usha Thorat,  Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India at the 4thProgramme on Human Development and State Finances jointly organised by College ofAgricultural Banking, Reserve Bank of India, UNDP and the Planning Commission, atCAB, Pune on January 16, 2006movement are not lost while establishing linkages between this sector and banksin achieving the MDGs. In the context of the overall fiscal constraint faced bymost States, the linkages between the formal financial system and thecommunity based organisations can be effectively exploited by the StateGovernments to meet the challenges of ensuring achievement of the MDGs.I would like to share with you two recent cases witnessed by me that could be ofsome interest and relevance. The first relates to women self help groups (SHGs)that I recently visited in Ajmer. The NGO, has catalysed groups that consist ofpoor Muslim women and trained them in making crochet caps for the nearbydargah. The groups now supply these caps and other items to distant places.Initially the women were neither taken seriously nor supported by their men folk,but after successive drought years when they found that the supplementaryincome from the women enabled the families to be free from starvation, theSHGs gained credibility and won the support of the men folk. The leaders havebecome so empowered that they go to Ajmer and even to Jaipur for procurementof yarn and for marketing the produce. In the process of empowerment thewomen are actively encouraging their children including girls to be regular inschool and they have shown active interest in adult literacy classes. They nowwant to learn how to keep their accounts on the computer. There is much moreconsciousness on sanitation issues and preventive health care. These womenare also prepared to travel as far as Kutch for exchange of experiences withother women SHGs involved with craft production. The SHG is supported bybanks and NABARD under the SHG bank linkage programme.The other case relates to a visit to three villages near Kolhapur where the ZillaParishad with active involvement of the gram panchayat and banks are buildingtoilets with the entire expenditure of a toilet construction met through bank loansgiven to individual families through a very simple procedure. The loans are basedon assessment of family’s cash flow and repayable over four years. The toiletsrange from the simplest soak pit type to more elaborate ones linked to bio gasunits. The procurement of septic tanks and material has been arranged onwholesale basis; locally trained masons are executing the work, with labourinputs from the villagers themselves so as to keep costs and consequently theloan amount low. There is no subsidy element in the financing. While returningfrom this village, we passed through another village. It was dark and suddenly asthe cars headlights hit the road, we saw women from either side of the roadgetting up hurriedly. This image starkly brought home the meaning of the MDGsfor ensuring human dignity.These cases represent the progress that can be made in achievement of MDGswhere there is local leadership, community participation and involvement of thefinancial sector with the Government playing a facilitating role. What is significantis that in both these cases there is no subsidy or budgetary support. Thequestion is whether these are replicable and can we achieve the desired scale?The answer is yes provided the three pillars, viz., the State government, theformal financial system and the community based organisations work together.Without connecting rural roads, there is very little that can be achieved by theformal financial system or NGOs. Hence it is appropriate that due emphasis isbeing placed on rural roads and rural connectivity. This has to be an area forpriority for state funding.The SHG movement in India has enabled social and economic inclusion ofwomen. The SHG-bank linkage movement where SHGs are linked to banks in agradual way - initially through savings and later through loan products - has beenable to ensure financial inclusion to a certain extent. However, there is a need toincrease their credit absorptive capacity as a large number of SHGs linked to thebanking system are utilising the credit only for consumption purposes.  Theyhave to migrate to employment generating activities so as to be able to fully reapthe benefits of economic freedom. Nevertheless, the SHGs and in many casesSHG federations have played a pivotal role in the creation of social capital andempowerment.  There are hundreds of examples where the SHGs  have workedwith NGOs  and Government agencies to bring drinking water to their villages,conduct regular health camps, organise adult literacy camps and generallyimprove the social status of members. For example, the SHG Federations activein Tamil Nadu have been able to provide life insurance products through aninternally administered scheme.  In Kerala, the Kutumbashree model set up bythe Government covers a variety of financial services as also health insurance.The Friends of Women's World Banking (FWWB) have started a Social SecurityProject in association with micro finance agencies/NGOs and insurancecompanies to provide life insurance to lakhs of persons and non life insuranceproducts like livestock insurance and health insurance. Other innovative productslike hut insurance, food security, pension scheme, etc., too have been launched.Since the SHG Federations/NGOs or, the MFIs provide the gateway to a largenumber of families and absorb administrative costs both in insuring and in claimsettlement, such schemes have been able to keep the premium to the minimum.In Orissa there are reports about an NGO working amongst disabled womenliving in abject poverty. Their intervention has resulted in finding a united voicefor these women, getting the necessary certificates and thus getting facilities dueto them and also bank finance for economic activities.Apart from the SHG bank linkage, the experience of the formal banking systempartnering with micro finance organisations set up as societies, cooperatives,trusts and NBFCs including Section 25 companies has also been extremelyencouraging. These tend to be on a larger scale with services ranging fromhealth, education, marketing apart from savings, loans and insurance.  Theselinkages have also grown without government intervention and have proved to beefficient. In both models, the challenge is in reducing transaction cost so as tokeep the services affordable while covering costs and thereby ensuring increasein outreach and sustainability.The formal financial system has to recognise the huge business potential comingfrom the unmet demand for financial services from those who normally tend to beexcluded. The focus on financial inclusion comes from the recognition thatfinancial inclusion has several externalities which can be exploited to the mutualadvantage of those excluded, the banking system and society at large.  Banksneed to understand the market and develop products suited to the clientele. Theyneed to develop data sets to evolve risk assessment models for proper ratingand pricing. Financial inclusion has to be viewed as a business strategy forgrowth and banks need to position themselves accordingly.  Furtherimprovements in rural connectivity, through roads, power and telecom, canensure greater penetration by the financial system into remote areas and providesafe and efficient financial services to large segments of the financially excluded.Use of IT, apart from speeding up transaction time and reducing cost, facilitatesbuilding automatic safeguards by ensuring on-line identification, authorisation,monitoring, transparency and accountability and in turn enables banks to dealwith much larger numbers with minimum risk. The State governments will need toensure such rural connectivity and also facilitate capacity building to use IT in abig way.Let me now proceed to highlight some of the recent initiatives that RBI has takento promote financial inclusioni. As a proactive measure, the RBI in its Annual Policy Statement for theyear 2005-06, while recognising the concerns in regard to the bankingpractices that tend to exclude rather than attract vast sections ofpopulation, urged banks to review their existing practices to align themwith the objective of financial inclusion. In the Mid Term Review of thePolicy (2005-06), the RBI exhorted the banks, with a view to achievinggreater financial inclusion, to make available a basic banking  ‘no frills’account either with nil or very minimum balances as well as charges thatwould make such accounts accessible to vast sections of the population.The nature and number of transactions in such accounts would berestricted and made known to customers in advance in a transparentmanner. All banks have been urged to give wide publicity to the facility ofsuch ‘no frills’ account. A number of banks have since come out withschemes for such ‘no frills’ account facility.ii. Further, in order to ensure that persons belonging to low income groupboth in urban and rural areas do not face difficulty in opening the bankaccounts due to the procedural hassles, the KYC procedure for openingaccounts has been simplified for those persons with balances notexceeding rupees fifty thousand (Rs. 50,000) and credits in the accountsnot exceeding rupees one lakh (Rs.1,00,000) in a year.iii. RRBs have been specifically advised to allow limited overdraft facilities in‘no frills’ accounts without any collateral or linkage to any purpose. Theidea is that provision of such overdraft facility provides a ready source offunding to the account holder who is thereby induced to open suchaccounts. From the bank’s point of view, the offering of a "no frills"account should represent the beginning of a sustainable relationship thatwill be mutually beneficial. Looking at the numbers involved, there is nodoubt that banks should look at technology based solutions and low costdelivery mechanisms that will reduce transaction cost of such serviceswith the volumes required to make such a model sustainable.iv. For all borrowers where the principal amount is less than Rs 25000, bankshave been asked to offer a one time settlement scheme. As there arelarge number of such very small NPAs with banks, offer of such an OTS isexpected to restore borrowing relationship with the formal system andthereby obviate the need to go back to the informal system. Banks,however  need to give wide publicity to the scheme at their rural and semiurban branches. In case where the loans are under governmentsponsored schemes the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) isexpected to evolve a suitable policy.v. In urban areas, credit cards enable households to manage to get theircredit needs met by the banking system, with not only the ability to makepurchases on credit but also facility to draw cash against card. In the ruralareas, there are no points of sale or outlets where plastic cards can beused. Banks have been recently advised by RBI to provide a Generalpurpose Credit Card (GCC) facility at their rural and semi urban brachesThe credit facility extended under the Scheme will be in the nature ofrevolving credit. The GCC-holder will be entitled to draw cash from thespecified branch of bank up to the limit sanctioned. Banks would haveflexibility in fixing the limit based on the assessment of income and cashflow of the entire household. However, the total credit facility under GCCfor an individual should not exceed Rs.25,000. Interest rate on the facilitymay be charged as considered appropriate and reasonable. Theborrowers would be eligible for availment of the credit facilities providedunder GCC, as per their requirement, without any insistence on securityand the purpose or end-use of the credit. Fifty per cent of creditoutstanding under GCC up to Rs.25,000 will be eligible for being treatedas indirect agricultural financing coming under the ambit of priority sectorlending norms. The eligibility criteria will be subject to review. It is notnecessary that GCC should be linked to purchases and GCC may notnecessarily be in the form of a card. GCC can be issued in the form of aPass Book, if the holder of GCC desires to operate cash withdrawals frombank branches. It is expected that banks will come out with their ownschemes to popularise this product amongst the rural clientele.vi. A major recommendation made by the Internal Group set up by RBI onmicro finance (Khan Committee), currently under consideration, is topermit banks to use micro finance institutions as business facilitators andcorrespondents to enable banks to increase their outreach and ensuregreater financial inclusion. This recommendation which will lead toprovision of micro-finance services at the doorstep of the customer, canmake substantial change in the availability of comprehensive financialservices in rural areas and to the poor and the disadvantaged in both,rural and in urban areas.Banks need to view these recent measures as an opportunity to provide timelyand adequate financial services and increase their share in a rapidly growingmarket. In case of GCC or overdfrafts in ‘no frills’ accounts, the interest rates canbe appropriately fixed while building in incentives for prompt payment.Financial inclusion has several benefits. Establishment of an account relationshipcan pave the way to the customer availing of a variety of savings products, loanproducts for consumption livelihood and housing. The account can be used formaking small value remittances at low cost and making purchases on credit. Thesame banking account can also be used by State Governments to provide socialsecurity services like health and calamity insurance under various schemes forthe disadvantaged. It is often felt that some contribution should be made by thebeneficiary so that he has some stake. However, the deterrent is that the cost ofcollection of the premium that can be more than the premium itself. If however itis collected through a no frills account, the cost is practically nil. From the bank’spoint of view, having such social security cover makes the financing of suchpersons less risky and hence can be covered by the loan component. Reducedrisk means more flow of funds at better rates. Furthermore there is a completeaudit trail and transparency. In other words the single gateway of a bankingaccount can be used for several purposes and represents a win-win situation.The Employment Guarantee Scheme being rolled out in 200 districts in thecountry which would bring in large number of people through their savingsaccounts into the banking system is another opportunity to promote financialinclusion in its fullest sense.I would now like to focus on the role of the State governments. While there is noalternative to raising revenue through taxes and user charges so as to have theresource base to undertake huge investment in physical and social capital, it ispossible, even in the present milieu to give focused attention to a few areas. Firstly, there are many programmes where the central assistance is notdrawn down due to the inability on the part of States to provide matchingcontribution and such allocations often lapse. It could be consideredwhether contribution from the beneficiary (supported by a loan from abank) can be blended with the State’s contribution to achieve the amountrequired to use the Central assistance. Banks can tie up with communitybased organisations having a good track record to provide the comfort ofknowledge of the borrower. Secondly, States can leverage on the provision of guarantees. There is arecent instance where the State housing board has partnered with a bankfor housing schemes for families below poverty line (BPL) in urban areaswhere the housing board provides a first loss guarantee to the extent of 10per cent of the loan amount. The housing board identifies the beneficiariesand helps in recovery. The title is passed only on completion of loanrepayment.  In addition to making available the housing loan, healthinsurance cover is also provided with either the premium being fully orpartly provided by the State Government. There could be calamity oraccident cover as well. Like I mentioned earlier, such insurance reducesthe risk of the loan asset and can lead to more flow of funds and betterpricing. Thirdly, in urban areas, there is considerable scope for better pricing ofservices. It is common knowledge that the poor end up paying more forvarious public goods, such as, water, power, sanitation.  Efficient provisionof services, with minimum leakages, and their comparative pricing iscritical. Formulation of schemes that have a viable pricing policy willenable the involvement of the financial system to ensure that adequatefunds are available for such infrastructure projects.This initiative of the Planning Commission in conducting this programme incollaboration with the United Nations Development Programme and the Collegeof Agricultural Banking is indeed a very welcome one to build synergy throughmutuality and convergence of the efforts of all the major stakeholders in theprogress towards achievement of MDGs.I find that your time here has been structured well with presentations by anumber of eminent persons on various aspects having a critical bearing onhuman development, such as, public health, livelihood, government and groupwork as well as experience sharing ending up with an interesting quiz. I wish youa fruitful week ahead.
