?  Changing Inflation Dynamics in India  I thank the Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) for  giving me this opportunity to address this distinguished gathering.  I propose to  speak on inflation which is a matter of concern to all of us.  What is inflation?   Simply put, inflation is the sustained increase in the overall price level.  Relative  change in prices of goods and services is a desirable attribute of market economy  as it reflects productivity changes as well as demand and supply conditions.   However, when this process transforms into an acceleration of the overall price  level, we need to worry as inflation imposes many socio-economic costs.     The headline wholesale price index (WPI) inflation averaged 9.6 per cent  in 2010-11 as compared with 5.3 per cent per annum in the previous decade.  Similarly, the average consumer price inflation, measured by the consumer price  index for industrial workers (CPI-IW), was even higher at 10.5 per cent in 2010- 11 as compared with 5.9 per cent per annum in the previous decade.  Moreover,  this elevated level of inflation also persisted through the first quarter of 2011-12.   In response to inflationary pressures, the Reserve Bank has raised the policy repo  rate 11 times bringing it up from a low of 4.75 per cent in March 2010 to 8.00 per  cent by July 2011.  It is expected that inflation should come down towards the  later part of this year.   Why has inflation been so high and persisted for so long?  This is the  theme of my talk today.  In my presentation, I propose to address the following  questions: Is India an outlier among major countries in terms of recent inflation  performance?  Has the inflation process changed?  What are the causal factors   global and domestic as well as supply and demand?  I will conclude with some  thoughts on managing the inflation dynamics on the way forward.       ?  Speech by Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, delivered at the Motilal  th Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Allahabad on 13 August 2011.  The assistance  provided by Abhiman Das, Sanjib Bordoloi and Manjusha Senapati is acknowledged.  1 Is India an outlier in the inflation performance   among major countries?     It is important to appreciate the global backdrop in which we are  experiencing a resurgence of inflation now.  In the last decade, inflation was low,  both in advanced countries as well as in emerging and developing economies till  the global financial crisis unfolded. Consequently, global economy got into a  recession and global output declined by 0.5 per cent in 2009.  However, global  output growth rebounded to 5.0 per cent in 2010.    As the global economy recovered from the worst effect of the global  financial crisis, inflation picked up in emerging and developing economies.  This  was because the global recovery was largely driven by emerging market  economies (EMEs) what was termed as a two-speed recovery  a faster growth in  EMEs accompanied by a slower growth in advanced economies.  As output gaps  closed, there was increasing inflationary pressure in EMEs, particularly in Asia.   According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), consumer price inflation in  developing Asia almost doubled from 3.1 per cent in 2009 to 6.0 per cent in 2010  and is projected to be around the same level in 2011.  Latest data suggest that  1 inflation in rapidly growing BRICS remains elevated (Table 1).  * Table 1: Inflation in BRICS Countries   Country 2010  2011  @ (Average) (Latest) Brazil 5.06.9 Russia 6.99.0 India 9.69.4 China 3.36.5 South Africa 4.3 5.0 * WPI for India and CPI for other countries.  @  June/July (year-on-year)   Global factors  With recovery, global commodity prices rebounded given the higher level  of commodity intensity of growth in EMEs.  There was also an element of   1  Brazil, Russia, India China and South Africa.  2 2 financialisation of commodities given the global excess liquidity .  Crop loss due  to adverse weather conditions in many parts in the world coupled with increased  diversion of foodgrains towards biofuel exerted added pressure on global food  prices.  Thus, global commodity prices including food prices rose sharply.  For  example, the IMF Commodities Index rose by 24 per cent in 2010 on top of an  increase of 43 per cent in 2009. It further rose by 20 per cent in December 2010 April 2011, before moderating by about 2 per cent during JuneJuly 2011.   Notwithstanding some softening in the last few months, it is important to  recognize that the current level of commodity prices is almost double of that two  and half years ago (Table 2).  Table 2: Global Commodity Prices  (IMF Primary Commodity Index: 2005 = 100)    Dec-08 Dec-09 Dec-10Apr-11 Jul-11     All Commodities  98.4 140.9 174.7 209.9 198.9  Food  119.6 139.5 176.4 190.9 180.3  Beverage  132.5 176.7 192.6 216.6 210.0  Agricultural  Raw  Materials  87.6 111.2 146.9 171.6 161.5  Metals  107.5 176.8 233.6 250.1 242.2  Energy  91.6 137.9 167.1 212.6 200.7    The increase in commodity prices has affected different countries  differently depending on whether they are net importers or exporters of  commodities. India being a net importer of commodities, the adverse impact on  domestic inflation has been stronger.  Inflation increased in developing and  emerging economies with a combination of closing of output gaps and sharp  increase in commodity prices. In this regard, India is not an exception.  But the  level of inflation in India has been high compared to those in many EMEs.  This   2  While there is disagreement over the role of financial investment in commodity    markets,  financial flows to commodity funds typically increase with higher commodity prices further  accentuating price pressures.  3 suggests that apart from global factors, domestic factors have had a significant  influence on the inflation trajectory in India.     Has the inflation process changed?   In India, we have multiple price indices  6 consumer price indices and a  wholesale price index (WPI).  While the Reserve Bank examines all the price  indices both at aggregate and disaggregated levels, changes in the WPI is taken as  the headline inflation for policy articulation. Within the WPI, non-food  3 manufactured products inflation is considered the core inflation .   Going by any measure of inflation, India comes out as a moderate  inflation country, though occasionally inflation crossed the double digit mark.   The historical average long-term inflation rate was around 7.5 per cent.  But  significantly, there was substantial moderation in inflation in the 2000s.  The  annual average inflation rate was around 5.5 per cent irrespective of the inflation  indices taken, whether WPI or CPI.  This raises the question: did the inflation  dynamics change in the 2000s?  Monthly WPI inflation data  suggest that there  4 was a structural break around the mid-2000s with the inflation rate during the  latter half being higher (Chart 1).    Chart 1: WPI Inflation Shows Structural Break     3  Core inflation is generally estimated by excluding volatile food and fuel components from the  headline inflation, though there are various statistical methods of estimation of core inflation.  Analytically, core inflation is considered as an indicator of demand conditions.  4  Estimated by Bai-Perron test.  4  Per cent  Average WPI inflation increased from 5.2 per cent in the first half of  2000s to 5.5 per cent in the second half.  This was largely contributed by primary  food inflation. In fact, the core non-food manufactured products inflation  moderated from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent.  What did cause the structural break  in the mid-2000s?  A disaggregated assessment suggests that protein items largely  contributed to this change in trend (Table 3).    Table 3: Average WPI Inflation  (In Per Cent) Group/Sub-Group 2001- 2010 2001-2005 2006-2010 2010-11 Q1:2011-12  WPI 5.4 5.2 5.5 9.6 9.4  Primary Food Articles  (14.3) 5.8 2.4 9.2 15.8 9.1  Protein (6.4) 6.3 3.5 9.0 20.5 5.9  Milk (3.2) 6.3 4.5 7.9 20.6 7.3  Egg, Meat & Fish (2.4) 5.6 2.3 8.8 26.6 9.0  Industrial Raw Materials  (16.2) 7.9 8.4 7.4 17.2 16.5  Non-Food Manufactured  Products (55.0) 4.0 4.2 3.9 6.1 7.2  Figures in bracket indicate weights in WPI.    Not only did the average food prices rise during the second half of 2000s  but they were more volatile (Table 4).

For  example, the performance of monsoon has a significant bearing on the trend of  5 domestic foodgrain prices. Spikes in food prices normally subside as they are  transitory.  However, empirical analysis suggests that inflation in protein items  5 has become persistent .  This suggests that protein inflation has assumed a  structural character and is partly driven by demand factors. Within the protein  group, persistence was lower for pulses as well as egg, meat and fish, but it was  markedly higher for milk.  Thus, the persistence of protein inflation has changed  the inflation dynamics in the latter half of the 2000s. Increase in demand for  protein appears to be an inevitable consequence of rising affluence (Gokarn,  6 2010) . This process was further accentuated by renewed global food price shock  during 2010-11.   Among the processed food items, the persistence of inflation for  edible oils was high (Table 5).  Table 5: Persistence of Inflation    Commodity/Subgroup Sum of AR Coefficients   Food   Protein Items 0.58  Milk 0.81  Edible Oils 0.56  Non-Food   Non Food Manufactured Products 0.69  Industrial Raw Materials 0.55  Non-Food Articles 0.56    International price pass-through   While the persistence of inflation on protein items has increased, it still  has a relatively smaller share in overall WPI inflation.  What matters more for the  overall inflation trajectory is the non-food manufactured products inflation which  has a higher weight of 55.0 per cent in the WPI. It averaged 4.0 per cent in the  2000s with a moderation in the second half (Table 3).  Subsequently, there has  been a sharp increase in 2010-11 and 2011-12 so far. The non-food manufactured   5  Persistence is estimated as the sum of autoregressive coefficients of the inflation series of the  relevant items; a coefficient of over 0.5 is considered to be an indication of persistence.   6  The Price of Protein, Inaugural Address at the Special Conference in honour of Dr. Kirit  Parikh at IGIDR, Mumbai, October 26, 2010.  6 products inflation shows a major structural break towards the middle of 2009-10  around the time the global commodity prices rebounded (Chart 2).  This has also  raised the question: is the non-food manufactured products inflation an imported  inflation?     p Chart 2: Non-food Manufactured Products Inflation Trend Shifts U     7 Further, analysis suggests that industrial raw material prices also showed  a structural break in early 2009 and the average price increase has been high and  volatile (Chart 3). Moreover, the pass-through from non-food international  commodity prices to domestic raw material prices has increased particularly in the  recent years reflecting growing interconnectedness of domestic and global  commodity markets (Chart 4).

Demand factors    Price pressures can emanate from the supply side but it will be difficult to  sustain it without rising demand.  In this context, important information on recent  th trend in expenditure pattern and wages is available from the 66 round of NSSO  consumption survey and Labour Bureau.

While the share of per-capita expenditure in food has gone down, as could  be expected from rise in income levels, both in rural and urban centers, the dietary  pattern has shifted in favour of protein items whose share has gone up markedly  in the second half of 2000s (Chart 6).  Chart 6: Share of Protein in Food Consumption Rises 33 31 29 27 25 Rural Urban 1999-00 2004-05 2009-10      The sharp increase in rural consumption of protein seems to have been  sustained by increase in wage rates of the unskilled rural labourers both in  nominal and real terms (Chart 7).  9  Per centChart 7: Wage Rates of Unskilled Rural Labourers Rises 25 20 15 10 5 0 Nominal Wage Rate Real Wage Rate      In the formal sector, company finance data suggest that the wage bill has  risen at a faster rate since the middle of 2009-10 (Chart 8).         st th  As per the NSSO surveys (61 round and 66 round), nominal wage rates  of skilled workers in both rural and urban areas increased much faster in the  second half of the 2000s than in the first half.

Chart 11: Rise in Fiscal Deficit adds to Demand Pressure    11  These evidences taken together suggest that sustained rise in real wages  both in the formal and informal sectors in the recent years contributed to increase  in demand.   Conclusions  The recent surge in inflation has become more generalised. Food inflation,  prone to supply shocks, is also assuming a structural character given the change in  the dietary habits and high demand, in absence of adequate supply response.  Sharp increase in non-food manufactured product inflation suggests that  producers are able to pass on the cost increases, given higher demand. While the  persistence in non-food manufactured products inflation is high, the persistence of  food inflation has increased making the overall inflation rate sticky. The current  inflation process, therefore, is an amalgam of both supply constraints and demand  pressures.   Prolonged high inflation even if originating from supply side would give  rise to increased inflation expectations and cause general prices to rise. Poorly  anchored inflation expectations make long-term financial planning more complex  with potential adverse effects on investment and growth. Moreover, high inflation  is the most regressive form of taxation, particularly on the poor. It is, therefore,  important to contain inflation and keep inflation expectations anchored so that  consumers do not mark up their long-run inflation expectations by reacting to a  short period of higher-than-expected inflation.    Keeping in view the costs of inflation and the fact that high inflation is  inimical to sustained growth, the medium-term objective of the Reserve Bank is  to bring down inflation to 3.0 per cent consistent with Indias broader integration  with the global economy. In this direction, monetary policy aims to contain  perceptions of inflation in the range of 4.0  4.5 per cent with a particular focus  on the behaviour of the non-food manufacturing component, which is considered  as core inflation given its high degree of persistence. Going forward, both global  and domestic factors will shape the inflation outlook. With increasing global  12 integration, global commodity prices are having an increasingly significant  influence on domestic prices. It is expected that global commodity prices will  peak in 2011 which should provide some relief to domestic inflation scenario.   The Reserve Bank signaled the reversal from its crisis driven expansionary  monetary policy stance in October 2009. Since then, the cash reserve ratio (CRR)  has been raised by 100 basis points. The policy repo rate has been raised by a  cumulative 325 basis points. As the liquidity in the system transited from surplus  to deficit, the effective tightening has been of the order of 475 basis points.  Thus,  the cumulative monetary policy action would have the desired impact on inflation.  While inflation is expected to moderate towards the later part of the year  reflecting monetary tightening and likely softening of global commodity prices,  fiscal policy needs to be supportive in containing aggregate demand. In addition,  there is an urgent need to address the issue of structural supply constraints,  particularly in agriculture, so that these do not become binding constraints in the  long-run hampering the task of inflation management.    13
