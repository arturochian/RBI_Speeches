Reserve Bank of India Archives:Some Reflections and the Way forward*Rakesh MohanIt is a real pleasure to be here today on the occasion of theSilver Jubilee Inaugural Function of the Reserve Bank of India Archives(RBIA), earlier known as the Central Records and DocumentationCentre (CRDC).  The Reserve Bank of India established its CentralArchives on August 24, 1981 with twin objectives to serve as (i)repository of non-current permanent records and (ii) the CentralArchives of the Reserve Bank of India for research purposes.  I ampleased to inform you that the RBI was one of the few organisations tohave a corporate archive in the 1980s.  It is a tangible sign of our activeinterest in archives in general and our archival heritage in particular.This past year has been an important year for the Reserve Bankin terms of historic milestones.  The Third Volume of its History,covering the period 1967-1981 was released by the Prime Minister, Dr.Manmohan Singh, also our former Governor, on March 18, 2006. Sincethe Reserve Bank also completed 70 years of its existence in 2005, ourannual publication the Report on Currency and Finance 2004-05reviewed the Reserve Bank’s evolution as a Central Bank as its theme.But with all these milestones, we should not merely be stuck in thepast.  We should use these occasions to look ahead as well.  Inreviewing our own evolution as a Central Bank, we also had occasionto look into the evolution of central banking in general.  The generalimage of central banks is that of conservative, stodgy, rigid institutions.It therefore came as a surprise to us that the Reserve Bank, along withother central banks, has been changing quite significantly in practiceand function as the economic conditions and needs have changed overtime.  There has been a continuous process of change.  It is thereforeof the utmost importance that we lay appropriate emphasis on the                                                * Inaugural address of Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Silver JubileeInaugural Function of Reserve Bank of India Archives in Pune on September 29, 2006. 1presentation of our archives, so that all these changes are welldocumented and available for interpretation by future historians.Archive is not a new concept.  Archives constitute the memoryof people and organisation and collectively that of the world.  Archiveshelp in forming our destiny to come together like individual parts of amusical score that create the symphony of history, past journeys whichreveal our nature and origin and provide understanding of the past toth thilluminate the future.  It is reported that, as early as the 5 – 4centuries BC, the Athenians kept valuable documents in the temple ofthe mother of the Gods, known as, 'Metroon'.  A great number ofdocuments are said to have been kept in the temple: treaties, laws,minutes of the assembly, statements of the political philosopherSocrates in his own hand, plays of Sophocles and Euripides, list ofvictors in Olympic Games, and the life.  In Ancient India the recordswere engraved as edicts as well as kept in Buddhist monasteries.Ancient archives are usually literally cast in stone.  Now we etch themon microfilm.  We hope that these will last as long as the stone edicts.And, perhaps, people 2000 years from now will refer to the RBIarchives as a temple!But Archives are not only about long term memory about historyand culture.  Archivists are also of immediate help to theirorganisations in ensuring proper management and presentation ofinformation and devising policies for systematic destruction of recordsthat are of no value.  Archives see to it that the organisation keeps acorporate memory, and preserves only valuable records that becomemanageable, retrievable and usable.   In doing so the Archives help toensure better decision making and promote proper accountability.Thus, Archives contribute to efficiency and economy in their ownadministration while nurturing the collective memory without whichpeople, research scholars, administrators and organisations wouldotherwise grope in the dark of amnesia.                                                                                                                               . 2It is the records that tell us about our past and guide us for thefuture.  Without records, past mistakes would be no longer lessons forthe future.  Citizens would not have any source material for writing pasthistory.  Indeed, without records, our sense of continuity as a peoplewould be jeopardised.  A nation must believe in three things: it mustbelieve in the past; it must believe in the future; it must, above all,believe in the capacity of its own people to learn from the past so togain judgement in creating their own future.Our records are created for business purposes but with passageof time these records become the documentary heritage of the Bank.Our heritage goes back to 1935.  With our current records and thosethat we have inherited, we have approximately 35,143 records in thecustody of our archives.  These records include files, registers,photographs, press-clippings, publications and CDs.  Some of theimportant documents include letters from Sir Osborne Smith, firstGovernor of RBI to Sir J.B. Taylor, first Deputy Governor (1935) onauthorising the latter to preside over the meetings of the Committee ofCentral Board (CCB) during his tour to London; Now this instruction iscontained in a standing CCB resolution recorded whenever a newDeputy Governor is appointed.  There is another letter from ShriJawaharlal Nehru, first Prime Minister of India, to Shri C.D. Deshmukh,first Indian Governor of RBI, requesting him to send an analytical reporton the deteriorating economic condition and suggest remedies. Wenow do a regular economic assessment every quarter along with thequarterly monetary policy statements.  We also send a weekly report tothe Prime Minister’s office as a routine.  The records include theinstructions for elimination of pies from the banking accounts andcheques (1945); devaluation of Indian rupee and the new parity ratewith foreign currencies (1966); division of assets between India andPakistan on the partition of India, among others.To facilitate research on the RBI and banking, RBIA also has anarchival library wherein all publications brought out by the RBI and. 3other sister organisations are available.  RBIA is not only preservingthese records but also making them available for research purposes.According to the Reserve Bank of India Archives Historical ResearchRules (2001) the non-current records which are more than 30 years oldare open for research purposes.  Access to records is open tostudents, research scholars and members of the staff of the ReserveBank of India and other banks.  I hope that we become more pro-activein the usage of these archives for scholars’ purposes.  We havedecided to devote significant resources for the maintenance of RBIArchives.  They should therefore be used more regularly by schoolsthan they are currently.  May I urge the Archives managers and RBIadministration to give special consideration on how the Archives canbe used better?  One idea could be the institution of scholarships andfellowships for students and researchers for this purpose.A new technological development available to us now is thepossibility of archiving oral histories of key participants in policydevelopments in both digital audio and video form.  Being deeplyconscious of the need to use the past to inform the future, I am glad toinform you that the Reserve Bank has initiated a process of makingsuch recordings by interviewing some key policy makers in both theReserve Bank and the Government who were continue in the 1980sand 1990s.  As this project is completed, this will be a new form ofarchive that will be available for future historians.I understand that the Reserve Bank of India Archives has beenformulating and implementing scientific procedures and guidelines forsharing, preserving and utilising our documentary heritage.  The firstand foremost requirement for such a programme to be successful isthat it should be based on sound and result oriented professionalism.  Ifeel that all concerned must ensure professionalism in their work ofkeeping archives.  There are three aspects to the issue of proper up-keep of archives: (i) the physical preservation of the valuable records;. 4(2) their proper organisation so that they may be easily retrieved andconsulted; and (3) prevention of their improper use.Physical preservation of its record holdings based on thescientific principle is one of the priority areas of emphasis in of theReserve Bank of India Archives.  Some new initiatives in the scientificpreservation of paper records have been undertaken by RBI Archives.These include fumigation and deacidification of records. If the paper isstained, it is cleaned; if torn, it is repaired; if weakened, it is reinforced,and finally loose papers are bound properly.  I am happy to note thatthrough scientific means efforts are being made to preserve theheritage of the Reserve Bank of India for future generations.All of us assembled here intensely feel and experience thatknowledge is essential to understanding and interpreting what is goingon.  There is also increasing understanding that right to information isas fundamental as any other fundamental democratic right.  The mainconstituent of knowledge being information, we are to be cautiouslydiligent in preserving information through compatible technologicalmeans.  Archival contents and information shall have to be preservedthrough either microfilming or digital means thus preserving ourarchival heritage.  I am happy to inform you that the Reserve Bank ofIndia Archives has taken up an ambitious project of microfilming andscanning of its records as a disaster management programme and aswell as to have electronic document storage and retrieval system forinstantaneous access.In spite of rapid developments in information technology, thebasic involvement of human beings in the process of informationgeneration in files and records cannot be entirely ruled out.  Tofacilitate record management activities, the Reserve Bank of India hasestablished Record Rooms in all its Central Office Departments andthe Regional Offices.  Efforts are being made to train the staff deployedin the Record Rooms so as to enable them to up-keep recordsproperly.  We must understand that slip-shod record management. 5activities may cause loss, dispersal and dilution of information contentof a file which may in the long run may prove detrimental to the interestof the Bank.  Hemmed in by local, national and global network wecannot ignore and neglect the records management activities – thebasic feeder to all information systems.I am happy to share with you that the Reserve Bank of IndiaArchives has been playing a proactive role in streamlining recordsmanagement in the Bank by providing on the spot advice on recordsmanagement to the Offices, providing professional expertise inappraisal and review of non-current records.  I firmly believe that forsuccess of any records management programme, participation andefforts at all levels are required.  Though no one can go back and makea brand new start but any one can start from now and make a brandnew ending.After the enactment of the Right to Information Act (RTIA) we, atthe Reserve Bank of India have welcomed it with enthusiasm.  As othercentral banks, we strive to be transparent in our work and show thatcommunication is essential to our work.  However, as our Chief PublicInformation Officer (CPIO) will confirm, some of our departmentssometimes have difficulty in retrieving information that is asked for.  Wetherefore need better documentation and retrieval systems.  This hasbecome even more important with computerisation.  I would like torequest the RBIA, in consultation with our Administration to considerappointing a group to look afresh into our documentation procedure inlight of the new developments.While talking about professionalism we cannot forget theincredible progress that has been made in the area of informationtechnology in the recent times.  Computers have revolutionised thetraditional concept of storage and retrieval of records.  Progressiveresearch in miniaturisation has made it possible to reduce vastquantities of records on a few computer chips making storage andretrieval of data exceedingly easy and the daunting shelves of records. 6have finally become user friendly.  The pace with which we are creatingnew records is unprecedented in the history of mankind, but fortunatelywe have also given to ourselves the ability to handle and manipulatethis ever increasing corpus of records for our benefit.  In the ReserveBank of India we have to equip ourselves with these skills so that weare not only able to preserve those valuable records which have beenhanded-over to us from the past but also we are able to process andstreamline the infinite number of records we generate.  When I speakof professionalism I mean this very skill, which must be acquired by ourArchives and Information Technology specialists if they want to copeup with the demands of future.  A Central Bank is a giant informationprocessing machine.  Our website bears testimony to this as does ourCentral Database Management System (CDBMS).  A great deal ofinformation is available in our website, as in other central bankwebsites: circulars, policy statements, reports, market information,economic data and the like, the CDBMS is a data warehouse alreadyavailable to the public.  The website is expanding almost every day byleaps and bounds.Distinguished bankers, academicians, scholars and archivistswould agree with me that establishing physical, administrative andintellectual control over our documentary heritage is the mostchallenging job because of sheer variety of media on which records arestored which includes paper, microfilms, CD's, DVD's, magnetic tapes,floppies, etc.  It is a really challenging job to integrate all informationwithin an organisation on various media and store and retrieve theinformation when required.  At present, the RBIA is preserving, storingand providing access to paper based records but in future all computergenerated records would also have to be preserved and transferred toArchives.  In this connection it may be noted that there is pertinentneed to establish systems and procedures for creation, maintenance,transfer and migration of all records of vital importance created byvarious offices and departments of the Reserve Bank of India in. 7electronic form to be preserved for administrative, evidential andhistorical purposes.I have just now mentioned that professionalism is indispensablefor any successful archival management programme - so are functionalarchival building, shelving systems and disaster managementprogrammes.  As you are aware, properly built archival buildings alonecan facilitate protection of records of national importance and historicalvalue from the vagaries of weather and fire.  The Reserve Bank ofIndia Archives has four large size records rooms each measuring about3,800 square feet.  The records are kept in centrally air-conditionedrooms.  The building is well equipped with fire fighting equipment likesmoke detectors with alarm alert system and fire extinguishers.  Thedigital Access Control System is being installed in the record rooms toprevent unauthorised entry.  Recently, Reserve Bank of India Archiveshas installed a Compactus Shelving System which protects recordsfrom dust and enables considerable saving of space.  Overall it can besaid that records are kept in ambient storage conditions in order toincrease their longevity.I am pleased to share with you that for proper development andto meet the challenges of future the Reserve Bank of India Archiveshas chalked out Future Plan for 2006 – 2011.Although the Reserve Bank of India has systems andprocedures for records management in place but a need for a properArchival Policy has always been felt.  Recently, the Committee of theCentral Board of RBI has also emphasised the need for clear-cutArchival Policy of the Bank.  This policy would enumerate the soundrecords management practices followed in the Bank in respect ofcreation and preservation of records, preservation schedule,maintenance of records, weeding and appraisal of records and transferof non-current permanent records to the RBIA.  This policy would, nodoubt, try to streamline the records management systems in the Bank.. 8It has been our experience that in some of the Central OfficeDepartments and the Regional Offices, records management is notbeing accorded due priority resulting in non-transfer of permanentrecords the to RBIA.  The geometrical growth of records puts alimitation on space that can be provided for storing them and on fundsthat could be made available for their proper maintenance and onservicing personnel required for their care and processing.  In view ofthis, RBIA will now initiate action on appraisal or review of non-currentrecords in the custody of the Central Office Departments and RegionalOffices in consultation with the creating agencies.We all are aware of the challenges posed by electronic records.The disappearance of physical entity of record is one of the mostintriguing and fascinating aspects of digital era.  The presentgeneration of Archivists and Record Managers have a challenging jobto make these records available whenever required.  RBIA wouldshortly initiate steps for digitisation of records in its custody.  At presentvital records in electronic form are kept at various locations indecentralised form and it is felt that if appropriate steps are not taken inthis direction these records would 'fade away' from the memory of theBank.  It is, therefore, essential that guidelines in this regard areformulated and scrupulously implemented.I am happy to inform you that during the Silver Jubilee Year anumber of initiatives are being taken by RBIA to enhance its image andutility.  A Currency Display Unit would be added in the RBIA.  Thecurrency display and archival exhibition would be open to visitors so asto make people aware of the role of RBI in country's economy andmonetary policy.  Last but not the least, RBIA would make a DisasterPreparedness and Reaction Plan.  Emphasis should be placed on theneed for fast and efficient reaction to even small incident as they havepotential to grow into something bigger if not contained.  I am sure,when ready, the plan would provide RBIA with guidelines to combat theemergency efficiently and effectively.. 9Before I end, I would like to emphasise the urgent need foradopting proactive approach in streamlining records management inthe Bank.  With the enactment of Right to Information Act (2005) therecords management system needs closer look so that systems areevolved for instantaneous storage and retrieval of information fordissemination purposes.  I once again congratulate RBIA and its staffon Silver Jubilee and hope that they would be able to tackle futurechallenges efficiently and effectively.Thank You.. 10
