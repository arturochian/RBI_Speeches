Financial Sector Reform and Financial StabilityMr. President and distinguished friends,thIt is a privilege and an honour to be invited for this 8 Global Conferenceof Actuaries. Dr. R. Kannan has been a respected colleague of mine for severalyears in the Reserve Bank and I am thankful to him for persuading me to joinyou. Also, Mr. C.S. Rao, Chairman, IRDA and Mr. D. Swarup, PFRDA have beenmy friends and colleagues in the Government of Andhra Pradesh andGovernment of India. Financial sector reform and financial stability are subjectsof high priority to central bankers, are of relevance to all financial regulators andmay be of interest to a gathering of finance professionals like actuaries. Myaddress will, therefore, focus on the features of the financial sector reforms inIndia; the initiatives taken to assure financial stability; the links between reformsand stability in the financial sector and conclude with some observations in thecurrent context.Financial Sector ReformThe financial sector reforms in India, like almost all other countries, havesome common and a few unique features. They were undertaken early in thereform cycle, in early 1990s. They were designed by eminent professionals in thecountry, and implemented pragmatically. This is evident from the dynamic mixbetween public and private ownership and transition of Development FinancialInstitutions as well as Unit Trust of India into their new incarnations. Fiscalsupport has not been burdensome and legacy problems such as non-performingloans have been absorbed by banks and not transferred to fisc. New regulatorybodies such as those for securities markets, insurance and pension funds havebeen legislated or are underway. While prudential regulation of banks has beenin vogue for decades, independent regulatory framework for other entities hasbeen a recent phenomenon. Enhanced competition has been induced with theentry of private foreign entities and foreign capital in financial sector. In brief,there has been progress in the three inter-related pillars of financial sector,namely ownership, regulation and competition.Let me illustrate the pragmatic nature of reforms in the fiscal-monetarypolicy interface. Reserve Bank entered into a Memorandum of Understanding tolimit the issuance of ad hoc Treasury Bills to the central government andterminate automatic monetisation of the government’s financial needs in 1994and 1997, respectively. The Reserve Bank avoided participation in the primaryissues in recent years except to prepay external debt or as a transition measure,last week. These de facto arrangements, proven to be workable, are coming into effect through legislative sanction only on April 1, 2006.                                             * Speech delivered by Dr. Y. V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 8th GlobalConference of Actuaries held in Mumbai on March 10, 2006Financial StabilityFinancial Stability is difficult to define and thus difficult to measure.Basically, it refers to the smooth functioning of the financial markets andinstitutions but it does not mean absence or avoidance of crisis but presence ofconditions conducive to efficient functioning without serious disruption. Therelevant legal, institutional and policy frameworks are wide ranging and policyinstruments at the disposal of authorities very varied. In a way, the financialstability objective is shared with a set of public policy bodies and professionalbodies like auditors and actuaries but the primary responsibility for overallfinancial sector efficiency and stability generally rests with the central bank. Theplausible reasons for such a responsibility are the major elements contributing tofinancial stability, namely, the oversight of the financial infrastructure, in particularpayments systems; regulation and supervision of financial institutions; crisismanagement and provision of liquidity; and macro financial stabilityencompassing monitoring not only the behaviour of all important players in thefinancial sector but also non-financial sector balance sheets as well as that of thegovernments.Financial Sector Reforms and StabilityNational authorities have typically adapted the design of financial sectorreforms - the pace, sequencing direction and ambit - to country-specificsituations, mindful of the threats to financial stability. The relevant considerationsmay be summarized here.First, there is substantial consensus, backed by some historical and cross-country evidence, that there are strong complementarities between financialstability and macroeconomic stability.Second, a key issue in the design of financial sector reforms is the pace ofreforms in the context of ensuring financial stability. Opinion remains sharplydivided over the choice between a big-bang approach or shock therapy and acautious or gradualist strategy. On balance, it appears, the reforms need to beintroduced more as a process than as a short-lived event while the processmoves fast enough to produce reasonable results without running the risk ofdisruption in the short run.Third, in case the gradualist approach is adopted, the question that arisesis what should be the optimal sequencing of reforms which secures financialstability. Such sequencing is crucial for ensuring inter-sectoral balances andavoiding the chances of disproportionality.Fourth, no reform process, however, paced and sequenced, can beconsistent with financial stability if it is widely perceived as temporary and lacking                                                                                                                                 credibility. In a market-based environment, the expectations of the economicagents are extremely important for economic decisions. The reform process cansucceed only if the economic agents, especially investors, believe that thereforms are enduring. The issue of credibility is inter-related with the choice ofthe pace of reform. Our experience has been that a graduated pace winscredibility since it avoids disruptions and roll-backs in the short run while at thesame time allowing the beneficiaries to build a consensus in  favour of continuingreforms. A key issue is that of managing expectations.There is reason to believe that the financial reforms process in India hasgreatly aided in strengthening and reinforcing financial stability. The financialsector has acquired the strength to absorb shocks, largely facilitated byregulatory actions. The financial system is now robust and resilient, contributingto public confidence and overall stability.At this stage, the optimism generated by impressive macroeconomicperformance and the modest success in implementing financial sector reformshas intensified pressures for significantly accelerating the pace of externalfinancial liberalisation. It is essential to take into account the risks associated withit while resetting an accelerated pace of a gradualist approach. It needs to beemphasized that the existing international financial architecture is not adequateto prevent or mitigate the domestic and external effects of a financial crisis inlarge economies like India. The impact of instability in times of crisis appearslargely to be borne by the home or domestic public sector rather than the globalprivate sector. The issue of setting the pace of financial liberalisation revisits theissue of trade-off between sustained growth and a growth rate that couldpotentially turn volatile and unstable. While it is necessary to add to the pace ofgrowth, it is also equally important to minimize the risks of instability, and theexperience shows that more than desirable pace of financial liberalisation wasoften followed by financial instability and crises. Avoiding crises is ultimately anational responsibility. The approach to managing the financial sector, the choiceof instruments and the timing and sequencing of policies are matters of informedjudgment, given the imponderables.Current ContextSome thoughts on the issue of financial stability in the current context, areperhaps in order.  Low growth accompanied by high inflation is a nightmare for acentral banker.  High growth coupled with low inflation is indeed a centralbanker's dream.  I have reason to be happy, considering the growth and inflationnumbers in India now.  So are all my brother or sister central bankers who seemto have similar positive trends. However, currently almost every central banker inthis globalised world keeps wondering whether the night ahead will continue thedream run and if so, when will it run out of steam.  The concerns of centralbankers today arise out of what has been described as stable disequilibrium -with every day adding to potential disequilibrium while continuing to be stable.The perceived risks arise mainly out of global imbalances and outlook for oilprices, particularly in the light of emerging geo-political situation.  Most marketparticipants seem to sense these risks but this sentiment does not appear to bereflected in the pricing of risks. Risks do not disappear but they get transferred toanother part of the system. The macro policies in emerging markets in particularhave to factor in these risks while continuously balancing financial sector reformand stability considerations. More important, for the regulators, monitoring wherethe risk lies has become very difficult due to emergence of large conglomerates,sophisticated market instruments such as derivatives and presence of playerslike hedge funds.  The good news is that there is international cooperationamong central bankers to mitigate the impact of such risks. The Actuaries cancertainly help the process of analysing the risks in insurance sectors that doaffect a large segment of population that in fact seeks to minimize such risksthrough insurance.Let me conclude by thanking the organisers for provoking me to thinkaloud and share my thoughts on a subject of common interest to all of usassembled here. I wish the conference fruitful deliberations, well balanced bypleasant stay and memories.
