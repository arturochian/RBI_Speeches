1In quest of new cheeseIBA deserves to be complimented for having organised this Seminar onthe subject of “In search of new cheese – Towards Newer Profit Avenues”. Thesubject holds considerable contemporary relevance coming as it does at a timeof intense competition, thinning margins, rising yields, and dwindling tradingprofits. As we look back we can see that the declining interest rate scenarioduring the last three to four years coupled with prudent regulation, in alignmentwith international standards and effective supervision has strengthened thebalance sheets of banks. It’s a different matter that had the asset quality been asit should have been, the profits could have been more gainfully utilised. What isof concern however, is whether the reduced NPA levels reported are sustainablethrough stronger credit appraisal processes built up over the years or are theyonly a result of massive provisioning which will be difficult to sustain in a scenarioof rising bond yields. Only time will tell.2. Before I talk of cheese let me begin by chalking out two issues on theexpenditure side in the future scenario. This chalk may serve to highlight thequest for cheese.3. First and foremost, banks would need to invest heavily in technicallyqualified professionally skilled staff. For this you recognise to invest in ARMS i.e.Attract, Retain and Motivate Staff.  Turnover of such staff in banks is going to beas volatile as it is for the BPO firms and compensation structures would needheavy revamping. This should necessarily be accompanied by good HRMsystem which can measure performances.4. Secondly, although technology deployment in banks has increasedremarkably, this has not been leveraged to the maximum extent essential toachieve and maintain high service and efficiency standards. In effect, managingtechnology, is still a key challenge for Indian banks. We have, therefore, had to                                                1 Speech delivered by Deputy Governor, Smt. Kishori Udeshi at the Indian Banks’ AssociationSeminar at Mumbai on April 26, 2005.2settle for just the standardised approach under Basle II. We need to move toadvanced approaches under Basle II in order to achieve greater efficiency ofcapital and be competitive in India as also globally. For this, banks not all butcertainly the large and significant banks need to invest heavily in advancedtechnology which is another item of expenditure that cannot be avoided in thenear future.5. Given this backdrop, can banks make profits by the same old 3-6-3 rule ?i.e.Pay 3% interest on depositsCharge 6% interest on loans andHead for the golf course at 3.Because there is grain of truth in this, I would say that perhaps they may manageto earn some profits but they would certainly not remain competitive.6. Banks would need to think of partnerships and strategies that werepreviously unthinkable – and perhaps still so – but these would need to betackled. For example, investment banking may have been thought of as beingunreasonably volatile but it may now be the need of the corporate customer.• Banks need to develop more efficient credit delivery mechanisms and thisshould form part of its repositioning strategy.• Banking data reveals concentration of banking business in urban / metroareas, with the top ten centres accounting for roughly 70% of bankingbusiness i.e. potential of rural / semi-urban areas remain relativelyuntapped. I may be naïve, but what beats me is the high spreads betweenthe formal and informal sector lending rates in the rural areas. Is cheesefor the money lender not cheese for a bank ?• Banking can forge and nurture appropriate public-private partnerships fordevelopment of micro finance activities.• SMEs have been a neglected segment of bank lending – year on yeargrowth in the SSI segment has been barely 5% as compared to 19%growth in total lending. It may interest you to know that in its search for3improving profitability, a large Japanese Bank introduced a product called“Uncollateralised Business Select Loan” aimed at small businesses in2002. It has been stated that this business generated net margins of 2% -2.5% compared with the net corporate lending margins of 0.8%-1.1%. Forthis, instead of relying on collateral, the bank developed a new creditscoring system and new methods of measuring default and counterpartyrisk as also new marketing methods.• Securitisation will enable banks to target profit growth from asset turnoverbased business rather than the Balance Sheet.• It is stated that non interest income accounts for nearly half of all operatingincome generated by US commercial banks. In India, it is less than one-fifth. While there is scope for increasing fee based income through non-traditional services, studies in the US suggest that increased reliance onfee based activities tends to increase rather than decrease the volatility ofbanks’ earnings stream.7. I am aware that the issues raised are neither new nor profound but ifsomething is oft repeated, there is a likelihood of it being acted upon. I amoptimistic in that sense. I would sum up by saying that improved profitability cancome through :(i) Improved asset quality through a more risk-management based bankingculture and(ii) Improved cost and revenue efficiency through use of advancedinformation technology and financial processes.8. And in concluding, I would remind banks that the societal concerns ofbanking, which assume relevance in an emerging economy like India, where asignificant proportion of the population resides in rural areas, should not lose itsprominence, in their quest for new “cheese”.
