               Financial Inclusion- Journey so far and Road Ahead  1. Mr Tamal Bandopadhyay Deputy Managing Director, Mr Sukumar, Editor Mint,  distinguished guests ,ladies and gentlemen ,at the very outset let me say that I  am extremely happy to be here with you this beautiful evening and thank the  Editor Mint for having me here,  to share with you the RBI perspectives on the  Financial Inclusion. I extend warm congratulations to Mint on celebrating a  decade of engagement with these issues which concern us all.   2. Dr. Raghuram Rajan, has powerfully enunciated the need for broad based  diversified growth leading to rapid reduction in poverty. Reserve Bank   developmental initiatives over the next few quarters will rest on five pillars, one  important pillar is  Financial Inclusion i.e. Expanding access to finance to small  and medium enterprises, the unorganized sector, the poor, and remote and  underserved areas of the country through technology, new business practices,  and new organizational structures; that is, we need financial inclusion.    3.  The expectations of poor people from the financial system are principally ease  of access, security and safety of deposits, low transaction costs, convenient  operating time, minimum paper work, ability to transact easily effect  frequent  deposits, avail quick and easy access to credit and other products including  remittances suitable to their income streams  and consumption patterns. The  provision of uncomplicated, small, affordable products can help bring low  income families into the formal financial sector. Low-income households in the  informal or subsistence economy often have to borrow from friends, family or  usurious moneylenders. They have little awareness and practically no access  to financial services that could protect their financial resources in exigent  circumstances such as illness, property damage or death of the primary  breadwinner .Taking into account their seasonal inflow of income from  agricultural operations, migration from one place to another seasonal and  irregular work availability and income, the existing financial system needs to be  designed to suit their requirements and to be more responsive to their needs. The mainstream financial institutions like banks have an important role to play  in this effort not as a social obligation but as a pure business proposition. The  push for financial Inclusion has come from the financial regulator/Government  at the level of macro policy the Banks have to translate this to concrete  outcomes at ground level to spur financial deepening.    4. Having said this let me now walk you through financial inclusion journey so far  and the way forward. "Financial Inclusion" was formally articulated by Dr YV  Reddy the then Governor RBI in the annual Policy Statement of 2005-06,  Governor while recognizing the concerns in regard to the banking practices  that tend to exclude rather than attract vast sections of population, urged banks  to review their existing practices to align them with the objective of financial  inclusion. The main features of the approach involve connecting people with  the banking system and not just credit. Financial exclusion is mainly in two  ways one is exclusion from the payments system i.e. not having access to a  bank account and the second type of exclusion is from formal credit markets  requiring the excluded to approach informal and exploitive markets. Taking a  cue from the Rangarajan Committee which first studied the issue of Financial  Inclusion in depth we have defined Financial Inclusion as the process of  ensuring access to financial services  and timely and adequate credit  where  needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections at an affordable cost  from Mainstream Financial Institution,. As Dr Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor  RBI  explains only the mainstream financial institutions have the capacity to  provide full services and meet the SCRIPT by extend in the complete breadth  of services Savings, Credit, Remittance, Insurance, Pension, Payments  transactions. Mainstream Institution i.e. banks must fulfill their core function of  intermediating and transferring resources from surplus to deficit units but both  deficit and surplus units are those with low incomes consequently the RBI  moved swiftly to enforce multiple policy level changes ranging from provision of  new products, relaxation of regulatory guidelines and other supportive  measures to achieve sustainable and scalable financial inclusion. To ensure  that customers who are linked to the banking system are provided with all the basic financial products that are required to enhance their income generation  capacity thus helping them to work their own out of poverty.   Milestones of our journey so far   I. Opening of No-Frills accounts: In November 2005, a new concept of  basic banking 'no-frills' account with 'nil' or very low minimum balance was  introduced to make such accounts accessible to vast sections of the  population. In 2012 the nomenclature was changed to Basic Savings Bank  Deposit Accounts (BSBDAs) for all individuals with zero minimum balance  and facility of ATM card/ Debit card, there is no charge on deposits and up  to four withdrawals in a month are allowed.  To summarize, every person  has the right to open a basic account Banks have been advised to provide  small overdrafts in such accounts to meet emergency credit requirement in  hassle free manner.  II. Engaging Business Correspondents: In January 2006, the Reserve Bank  permitted banks to engage Business Facilitators (BFs) and Business  Correspondents (BCs) as intermediaries for providing financial and banking  services. The BC Model allows banks to provide door step delivery of  services especially to do  cash in - cash out transactions, thus addressing  the last mile problem. The list of eligible individuals/entities who can be  engaged as BCs is being widened from time to time we have adopted a test  and learn approach to this process. In September 2010, RBI has allowed  for profit organisations excluding NBFCs to operate as BCs. Banks can now  leverage on the penetrative network of mobile companies. Mobile network  companies have joined hands with banks to make available banking  services to Indias unbanked population. The agents of mobile companies    work as Customer Service Providers (CSPs) and provide BC services, thus   expanding the outreach of banks .   III. Use of Technology- Recognising that technology has the potential to  address the issues of outreach and credit delivery in rural and remote  areas, in a viable manner, commercial banks were advised to implement  CBS so as to enable them to make effective use of ICT, to provide door  step banking services through Business Correspondents Model wherein the accounts can be operated by even illiterate customers by using biometrics,  thus, ensuring the security of transactions and enhancing confidence in the  banking system. RRBs, due to their proximity to rural areas, have the  inherent strength to scale financial inclusion, they have been have been  roped in by bringing them on the CBS platform. A robust payment system is  an essential adjunct of Financial Inclusion this is an extremely important  area.    IV.     Relaxation of KYC norms: The strict KYC norms inhibited linkage of  common people with the Banking System. Know Your Customer (KYC)  requirements for opening bank accounts were relaxed for small accounts in  August 2005, thereby simplifying procedure.  To facilitate easy opening of  accounts especially for small customers, Know Your Customer (KYC)  guidelines have been simplified to such an extent that small accounts can be  opened without any documentation by just giving a self certification in the  presence of bank officials. Further, in order to leverage on the initiative of  UIDAI, we have allowed Aadhaar, the unique identification number being  issued to all citizens of India, to be used as one of the eligible document for  meeting the KYC requirement for opening a bank account.  Recently in  September 2013, we have allowed banks to provide e-KYC services based on  Aadhaar, thus paving the way for account opening of all the people.  V. Simplified branch authorisation:  To address the issue of uneven spread of  bank branches, in December 2009, domestic scheduled commercial banks  were permitted to freely open branches in Tier 3 to Tier 6 centres with  population of less than 50,000 under general permission, subject to reporting.   .In the second quarter review of Monetary policy  Branch authorisation has  been relaxed to the extent that banks do not require prior permission to open  branches even in tier I centres,  subject to reporting.   VI. Opening of branches in unbanked rural centres: To further step up the  opening of branches in rural areas, banks have been mandated to open at  least 25 per cent of the branches in unbanked rural centres.  To help  facilitate achieving this mandate, banks have been advised to open to open  small intermediary brick and mortar structures between the base branch  and the unbanked villages. The idea is to create an eco-system for ensuring efficient delivery of services, efficiency in cash management,  redressal of customer grievances and closer supervision of BC operations.  To further encourage the banks to pursue this mandate, banks have been  advised to consider frontloading (prioritizing) the opening of branches in  unbanked rural centres over a three year cycle co-terminus with their FIPs.  This is expected to facilitate quicker branch expansion in unbanked rural  centres.  VII. Roadmap for providing Banking Services in unbanked villages with  population more than 2000: With financial inclusion gaining increasing  recognition as a business opportunity and with all banks geared to increase   presence, we adopted a phase-wise approach to provide banking services in  all unbanked villages in the country. On completion of the first phase where  nearly 74000 villages with population more than 2000 were provided with a  banking outlet, we are now in the second phase where the remaining  unbanked villages, numbering close to 4,90,000, are identified in villages less  than 2000 population and allocated to banks, for opening of banking outlets  by Match 2016.  VIII. Direct Benefit Transfer -The introduction of direct benefit transfer validating  identity through Aadhaar will facilitate delivery of social welfare benefits by  direct credit to the bank accounts of beneficiaries. Government proposes to   route all social security payments through the banking network using the  Aadhaar based platform. In order to ensure smooth roll out of the  Governments Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) initiative, banks have been  advised to open accounts of all eligible individuals in camp mode with the  support of local Government authorities, seed the existing and new accounts  with Aadhaar numbers and put in place an effective mechanism to monitor  and review the progress in implementation of DBT.  IX. Financial Literacy - Financial Literacy is an important adjunct for promoting  financial inclusion, We have adopted an integrated approach, wherein our  efforts towards Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy go hand in hand.   Through Financial literacy and education, we disseminate information on the  general banking concepts to diverse target groups, including school and college students, women, rural and urban poor, pensioners and senior  citizens to enable them to make informed financial decisions. To ensure that  the initiatives on the supply side are supported by initiatives on the demand  side, we have nearly 800 financial literacy centres set up by banks. In addition  to this we are leveraging the infrastructure created at the state level,  comprising of State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) at the Apex which is  ably supported by the Lead District Managers (LDMs) at the District level.  We  have designed  a  mass scale Financial Literacy Program  with an objective to  integrate the financially excluded population with low level of income and low  literacy level  with the formal financial system. Financial Literacy Centres  organize Outdoor Literacy camps which are spread over a period of three  months and delivered in three phases wherein along with creating awareness,  accounts are also opened in the Literacy camps The program has been  received well on the ground as an integrated approach of financial inclusion  through creating awareness and providing access simultaneously.  X. Financial Inclusion Plan of banks We have encouraged banks to adopt a  structured and planned approach to financial inclusion with commitment at the  highest levels, through preparation of Board approved Financial Inclusion  Plans (FIPs). The first phase of FIPs was implemented over the period 2010- 2013. The Reserve Bank has used the FIPs to gauge the performance of  banks under their FI initiatives. In this direction we have put in place a  structured and comprehensive monitoring mechanism for evaluating banks  performance vis--vis their targets. To ensure support of the Top  Management of the Bank to the Financial Inclusion process and to ensure  accountability of the senior functionaries of the bank, one on one annual  review meetings, chaired by Deputy Governor, Dr Chakrabarty are held with  CMDs/CEOs of banks. A snapshot of the progress made by banks under the  3 year Financial Inclusion Plan (April 10 - March 13) for key parameters  during the three year period indicates that  banking outlets increased to nearly  2,68,000 banking as on March 13 as against 67,694  banking outlets in  villages in March 2010. 7400 rural branches have been opened during this  period of 3 years. Nearly 109 million Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts  (BSBDAs have been added taking the total no of BSBDA to 182 million. Share of ICT based accounts have increased substantially - Percentage of  ICT accounts to total BSBDAs has increased from 25% in March 10 to 45% in  March 13. About  4904 lakh transactions  have been carried out in ICT based  accounts through BCs during the three year period.   After completion of the first plan period, we realized that there is a Access  Usage conundrum a large banking network has been created along with the  opening of large number of bank accounts. However, we have realized that  simply creating the banking infrastructure and opening bank accounts will not  fulfill our objectives of achieving total Financial Inclusion. To take the process,  forward banks have been advised to draw up fresh three year Financial  Inclusion Plans for the period 2013-16. To ensure involvement of all the stake  holders in the FI efforts and to ensure uniformity in the reporting structure  under the Financial Inclusion Plan, banks have are to ensure that the FIPs  prepared by them are disaggregated and percolated down upto the branch  level. The focus under the new plan is to ensure that the large banking  network created is utilized for extending other products viz. credit products,  which will help make the business more viable for banks. This would also  ensure that the large number of accounts opened see an equally large  volume of transactions taking place and people reap the benefits of getting  linked to the formal financial institutions.  XI. Robust Institutional Mechanism - Over the years one of our major  achievements and strength has been the creation of a robust institutional  mechanism which supports the roll out of banking services across the country.  The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) has been set up  which is headed by the Finance Minister. There is a Sub-Group of the FSDC  headed by the Governor, RBI and within that a Technical Group, headed by  Deputy Governor, Dr K.C.Chakrabarty, exclusively mandated to address  issues related to financial inclusion and financial literacy. In order to gauge the  performance of banks and to continuously review the various models adopted  under Financial Inclusion. RBI has constituted a Financial Inclusion Advisory  Committee (FIAC), headed by a Deputy Governor, Dr K.C. Chakrabarty.  XII. Road Ahead Extending the frontiers of the formal financial system XIII. For growth to be truly inclusive it  requires broadening and deepening the  reach of banking. A wider distribution and access of financial services helps  both consumers and producers increase welfare and productivity. Such  access is especially powerful for the poor as it provides them opportunities to  build savings, make investments, avail credit and more important, insure  themselves against income shocks and emergencies. As the real economy is  dynamic, it is imperative that the banking system is flexible and competitive to  cope with multiple objectives and demands made on it by various constituents  of the economy. To address the issues of urban poverty we have brought the  metropolitan urban areas like Mumbai under the planning and  review  mechanism of the lead bank scheme  Now to outline the way forward for meeting our possible dream of universal  Financial Inclusion.  5.  NEW BANK LICENSES to ensure that the banking system grows in size and  sophistication to meet the needs of a modern economy and for improving access  to banking services, we are in the process of evaluation of new bank license  applications They are expected to go beyond simply beefing up infrastructure like  handheld devices, smart cards, better vendors and service providers, etc  necessary to scale up the FI activities. These new banks are expected to bring  new technology innovative models bring in new business and delivery models  which would speed up the roll out of financial services to remote areas.Financial  Inclusion will work on the ACTA model Accounts,Cash in Cash Out ,Transactions  and Adjacencies which will help to build a revenue stream.  6.  BUSINESS and Delivery Model  We face several challenges in  implementation of financial inclusion policies. Of 2,68000 banking outlets nearly  221000 are BCs ie nearly 82% percent. Sustainability and scalability of the BC  model is essential. More and more innovative products will have to be introduced  which would benefit both banks as well as the rural people and at the same time  make the BC model more viable. A review of the cash management practices for  delivery of banking services through the branchless modes also needs to be  done for ensuring scaling up of the various models. 7. Usage of banking services- Using the first phase of our FI initiative, we have  successfully opened 74000 outlets in the rural areas. Going forward our idea is to  enable more transactions in these accounts by providing more credit products,  which will not only help rural people to avail of credit at comparatively lower rates  of interest but at the same time also make the BC model viable for banks. Skills  and capacity building of BC is as important as ensuring an adequate revenue  stream. An ATM network is also in place.  8. Financial Education - We have adopted an integrated approach for financial  inclusion wherein the supply side initiatives are supported by initiatives on the  demand side. In this direction banks have to support financial literacy and  awareness drives to make people understand the benefits of linking with the  banking system.  Including financial education in the school curriculum so as to  educate children about the benefits of banks and banking services. This will go a  long way in inculcating responsible banking habits at the young age, the  Technical Group of the FSDC has designed a National Strategy on Financial  Education.  9. Collaborative efforts -  Finally, financial inclusion cannot be achieved without the  active involvement of all stakeholders like RBI, other financial regulators, banks,  governments, NGOs, civil societies, etc. The current policy objective of inclusive  growth with financial stability cannot be achieved without ensuring universal  financial inclusion. Banks cannot  achieve this on their own an entire support  system has to partner with them in this mission.  All the stakeholders need to join  hands and make it possible. The support of policymakers, regulators,  governments, IT solution providers and public at large would bring a decisive  transformational change in Indian banking.  10. As our Governor, Dr. Raghuram Rajan, states we have to reach everyone,  however remote or small, with financial services. Financial inclusion does not just  mean credit for productive purposes; it means credit for healthcare emergencies  or to pay lumpy school or college fees. It means a safe means of remunerated  savings, and an easy way to make payments and remittances. It means  insurance and pensions. It means financial literacy and consumer protection. I  should emphasize the need for banks like the ones represented in this room to move beyond simply opening bank accounts to ensuring that poor customers are  confident and comfortable enough to use them. Innovation in reaching out to the  underserved customer, rather than simply posting higher numbers in branches or  bank accounts opened, has to be part of our efforts. We need a frugal,  trustworthy, and effective Indian model for financial inclusion. Our measure of  success should be the jobs that are created, not by giving government subsidies  or protections to labour-intensive industries or sectors but by developing a  facilitating, though competitive, environment that will result in the emergence of  the best solutions.This I would suggest the way forward for meeting our dream of  Financial Inclusion. Some of the measures are already in the pipeline. We are  awaiting the forthcoming recommendations of the Dr. Nachiket Mor Committee  on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low-Income  Households. The Dr. Sambamurthy committee will also guide us on how to  expand mobile banking in India through encrypted SMS based funds transfer  which can be used in any type of handset.So in sum while several challenges do  present themselves they catty within them the core of opportunities which will  spur development impulses and lead to growth with equity.Thank You for a  patient hearing.
