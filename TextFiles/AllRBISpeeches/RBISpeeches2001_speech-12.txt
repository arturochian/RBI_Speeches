Financial Standards and Codes *Governor Jayawardena, Deputy Governor It gives me great pleasure to deliver this public lecture at the Centre forBanking Studies (CBS) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  It gives me greater pleasureto share the podium with Governor Jayawardena whom I greatly admire for hisintellect, acumen and outstanding statesmanship. The last time I shared the sameforum with him was at the Second South Asia Forex Dealers’ Association Conferenceat Hyderabad in October 1998.  The East Asian countries were still in the midst ofcrisis.  I remember that he had listed do’s and don’ts of policy making for crisisSince both Sri Lanka and India shared many concerns in this regard, GovernorJalan had in August 1999 devoted the 49 Anniversary Lecture at the Central Bank ofSri Lanka to the subject of international financial architecture ( Jalan, 1999).Reflecting on the developing countries perspectives, he focused on several areas ofsignificance, viz., the exchange rate, the policy on reserves, the role of the externalprivate sector, the management of capital flows, strengthening the financial system,transparency in systems and development of standards and codes, reform ofinternational institutions and new arrangements for international liquidity. In particular, Governor Jalan flagged several issues relating totransparency in systems and developing standards and  codes, and today I propose tohighlight aspects relating to implementation of these standards and codes.There are several reasons for choosing to speak on this subject today.  Amongall the issues posed by Governor Jalan in his Colombo speech, noteworthy progress isnoticeable in respect of standards and codes.  Furthermore, the basic parameters onthe issue of codes enunciated by him stand vindicated by subsequent events.Moreover, India has gained some experience in sensitising the issues and creating awareness, and in attempting self-assessment of its own adherence to variousFinally, issues relating to financial stability have gained significant attentionof policy making in recent years.  In fact, Mr. Andrew Crockett, General Manager,Bank for International Settlements had made an outstanding analysis of “Why isFinancial Stability a Goal of Public Policy” (1997) in the Jackson Hole (Wyoming;U.S.A.) Conference of August 1997 in which I had participated.  More importantly,he has through the Financial Stability Forum, brought about a more approach to evolution, consolidation and implementation of international standardsand codes, though these initiatives need much more progress.  A description of thekey standards and the monitoring of their observance is available on the publication ofFinancial Stability Forum (April 2001) http://www.fsforum.org entitled “InternationalStandards and Codes to Strengthen Financial Systems” and so I will not spend timeStandards and The development of international standards and codes in the current contexthas five important features, viz., it is part of the reform of the international financialarchitecture; it represents a consolidated view of several interrelated standards andCodes : Current International Contextgiving a descriptive account of them.participativestandards and codes benchmarked against international norms.anthavoidance, and his words of wisdom continue to be valid even today.Wijewardena and friends,Issues in Implementing Internationalcodes; it is a collaborative effort involving different groups of countries, markets andinternational financial institutions and standard setting agencies and bodies; it haselements of  both external and internal assessments of degree of compliance; and,finally there is an assumption of linkage between the implementation of standards andFirst, in the light of the Asian crisis, the need for fundamental changes in theinternational financial architecture acquired greater urgency. Many proposals weremade for strengthening the international financial system. The focus of theseproposals was broadly on indentifying indicators of financial vulnerability,development of sound international codes, standards and best practices, introductionof preemptive measures and safety nets, and designing a framework for crisismanagement. Thus, while development of international standards and codes is onlyone element of the overall effort in the aftermath of the Asian crisis to reform theinternational financial architecture, significant progress is noticeable in this elementonly. As part of the effort to strengthen financial systems and improve coordinationamong the agencies responsible for them, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) wasestablished in April 1999. Its mandate is to promote international financial stability byimproving the functioning of markets and reducing systemic risk through informationexchange and international cooperation in supervision and surveillance of financialmarkets. The FSF has drawn together various standard-setting bodies which wereconstituted by means of cooperation among central banks, international financialinstitutions, national authorities and international supervisory and regulatory bodies.The FSF has posted on its website the Compendium of Standards, which serves as acommon reference for various standards. Currently, there are 69 standards cited in theCompendium.  A set of 12 standards has been highlighted by the FSF as key forsound financial systems and deserving of consideration for priority implementation.The key standards are broadly accepted as representing minimum requirements forgood practice.  The 12 key areas are  under three broad headings, viz.,macroeconomic policy and data transparency (covering monetary and financial policytransparency, fiscal policy transparency, data dissemination and data compilation),institutional and market infrastructure (covering insolvency, corporate governance,accounting, auditing, payment and settlement and market integrity) and financialregulation and supervision (covering banking supervision, securities regulation, andinsurance supervision).Second, the current initiative represents a consolidated view of severalinterrelated standards and codes. The international standard-setting bodies haveexisted for a long time, but each body was developing common codes and rules inisolation. There are various international organizations, which over the years havemade significant contribution to raising standards of soundness and risk-awareness infinancial systems. After the Asian crisis, it was  that the world economycan be exposed to potential threat of contagion from problems in financial marketsand so it became imperative to strengthen financial systems through intensifiedcoordination and cooperation among national regulatory bodies, internationalregulatory bodies and international financial institutions charged with fosteringstandards and codes. For the first time, a consolidated view of several standardsbroadly relevant to the financial sector was considered essential on an appreciation oftheir inter-linkages. For example, macro economic policy can affect the dimension of financial stability through its impact on the value of financial assets andliabilities.  More important, it can affect the functioning of the payments andsettlement systems.  Similarly, regulation and supervision are linked to good2sectoralrecognisedorganisedcodes and financial stability.accounting practices, bankruptcy laws and insolvency procedures, and corporateThird, the current process is a collaborative effort involving developed countriesand emerging economies, international institutions, public and private sector andsector, with the responsibility for implementation and accountability for results beingvested with the Government or the regulatory agency. It is now being recognised thatthe percolation of the compliance to certain standards and codes by the official sectorwill depend upon improvements in the private sector also.  For instance, whilebanking supervision/regulatory practices by official authorities would improvesignificantly by adhering to the core principles, in a market related environment, theoverall efficiency of the system cannot be enhanced without adequate response fromthe banking institutions themselves.  Similarly, corporate governance in banking andalso in the private corporate sector, in particular in securities firms would be animportant aspect.Fourth, the current initiative has elements of external assessment and incentivefor internal assessment of degree of compliance of a country with the key standardsand codes. Thus, the IMF and the World Bank have developed a collaborativeorganisational framework for assessing member countries’ observance of standardsand codes. The IMF assesses the implementation of standards as part of its Article-IVconsultations. The joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment )involves an assessment of financial sector standards. All FSAP access observance of,at a minimum, the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Policy Transparency Codes and theCore Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. Other standards are assessed asrelevant. Some of the financial sector standards may also be assessed by the Fund andthe Bank independent of the FSAP.  The assessments are documented in the Reportson Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC).  The IMF is preparing ROSCs onto its mandate of overseeing international monetary and financial stability.  TheWorld Bank is producing ROSCs on auditing, corporate governance, and insolvencyand credit rights systems. In preparing the ROSCs, the assessments have generallybeen sensitive to different stages of economic development, administrative capacitiesand heterogeneous cultural, legal and institutional conditions of Fund members.Participation in ROSC, however, continues to be voluntary in nature. assessments are also encouraged by international institutions and standard settingFifth, the entire exercise relating to the international standards and codes is beingundertaken on the premise that their implementation helps to promote sound financialsystems domestically enabling their smooth integration to global markets contributingthereby to financial stability internationally. They are meant to play an important rolein strengthening financial regulation and supervision, enhancing transparency,facilitating institutional development and reducing vulnerabilities. Standards are alsoexpected to facilitate informed decision making in lending and investment andimprove market integrity and, thereby, minimize the risks of financial distress andcontagion. No doubt, standards are not ends in themselves but a means for promotingsound financial fundamentals and sustained economic growth.It may be useful to assess the response to these international initiatives interms of the validity of the approach, adequacy of coverage of issues, symmetry of3Assessment of International Initiativebodies.Internaldata dissemination and fiscal transparency, which are considered to be areas importantProgrammes (FSAPregulators and market participants. The emphasis has been concentrated on the officialgovernance principles.treatment between participants, linkage between international standards and codes andFirst, the latest Trade and Development Report (UNCTAD, TDR, 2001)questions the validity of the overall approach to the reform of the internationalfinancial architecture.  It observes that the recent efforts have focussed on measuresmainly designed to discipline debtor countries.  While it is conceded that all thereforms that are being prescribed have their merits, there is an overriding presumptionin the prescriptions that “the cause of the crises rests primarily with policy andinstitutional weaknesses in the debtor countries and accordingly place the onus ofresponsibility of reform firmly on their shoulders”.  The Report observes thatinadequate attention has been given to the role of institutions and policies of creditorcountries.  The root of the problem, according to UNCTAD, “lies in the failure toestablish a stable system of exchange rates after the breakdown of the Bretton Woodsarrangements”. There are also criticisms that although the IMF introduced thecontingent credit lines, it has not been used so far. It is well recognised that thecapacity of the IMF to raise resources is severely limited and is inadequate comparedto the size of the recent financial packages.  There are also views that not much hasSecondly, there are varying perceptions among different actors resulting ininadequate attention to many aspects of international order. A study by Prof. Griffith Jones (2001) highlights that all key actors involved in the reform process,financial institutions share one common objective, which is, that they are in favour ofand benefit from sustained growth of developing countries.  According to the study,for some (developing countries and international financial institutions) it is adominant objective although it is not clear why it should not be so for others.  Thereis, however, far less agreement on specific measures to be taken for building a newinternational financial architecture.  An important example relates to the opening ofthe capital accounts by developing countries.  While international financial marketshave a strong preference for full opening up, most developing countries favour agradual and sequenced opening up.  The study also observes the attitudes of thedifferent players on specific changes in the international financial architecture.  Theareas include codes and standards, international liquidity, development finance,international regulation, standstill and orderly debt workouts and increaseddeveloping country participation.  The matrix shows that except in the area ofstandards and codes, most of the significant measures that would need to be takenThirdly, it is argued that the progress made so far refle cts asymmetry indifferent participants' responsibilities for the changes required.  The main criticism isthat it does not adequately address the concerns of developing countries. Theflaws in the system for international capital movements are to be found in recipientcountries which should thus bear the burden of adjustment needed to prevent orcontain financial crisis.  The UNCTAD Report (2001) states: ”the reform processrather than focussing on international action to address systemic instability and riskshas placed emphasis on what should be done by national institutions and mechanisms.creditors.  Thus, it seems as if standards and codes are being pressed upon developingcountries to improve transparency and disclosure without corresponding obligations4Even in this regard it has failed to adopt an evenhanded approach between debtors andobligations contained in the standards and codes seem to reflect the view that the mainhave not actually happened.viz., developed country Governments, banking and financial markets and internationalStephanybeen done on standstill arrangements and bankruptcy procedures.financial stability and issues of coverage of standards in IMF surveillance.for disclosure by financial institutions and hedge funds". I may, however, add that thisminimise the importance of standards to any nation. ItFourthly, the link between implementation of standards and codes andfinancial stability by itself is neither theoretically established nor backed by sufficientempirical evidence ( Vasudevan 2001). However, on the basis of first principles andjudgment, the linkage between the two elements is apparent.  Financial stabilityrequires stability of both financial institutions and financial markets. The stability offinancial institutions depends on the confidence of public regarding the ability of theformer to meet contractual obligations. Standards relating to effective bankingsupervision, for example, aim at enhancing stability of the institutions. Stability infinancial markets is reflected in market participants’ confidence at being able totransact at prices reflecting true market fundamentals. Standards on accounting,auditing, data dissemination, and securities settlements systems, in turn, aim atstrengthening stability of financial markets. The standards and codes, however, do notaddress the problem associated with inability of the market agents to understand andprocess the information. In a vast majority of developing countries, and possibly indeveloped countries as well, as the recent large corrections in the international stockmarkets suggest, mispricing of information could often give rise to instability. Thereare some markets, which tend to move more by noise and rumours than news. In suchmarkets, release of additional information may not be recognized and understood bythe players and may add more noise than information. Thus, in developing countries,it can be argued that information superiority of the regulator or Government may bejustified when it shoulders the dual responsibility of both “market development” andAs regards institutional stability, compliance with related standards appears tomake a positive contribution since the early warning indicators that could be compileddue to implementation of the relevant standards, could potentially contain theprobability and severity of a crisis provided timely action is initiated at the early signof vulnerability. Stronger and sound supervision of institutions in respect ofcompliance with related standards, while strengthening the preventive mechanismsand leading to timely and proactive interventions, may not fully insulate the systemA difficult issue that needs to be addressed while implementing standards andcodes for strengthening stability of institutions is that the implementation of standardsenables compilation and monitoring of information both on aggregated informationacross all financial institutions and on systemically important individual institutions.The implementation authorities should recognise the value and usefulness of bothsegregated and aggregated data and information and imbibe analytical skills andRecent initiatives on Macro-Prudential Indicators ( MPIs) aim at addressingthis particular issue of a macro-view. Aggregation of performance indicators acrossheterogeneous groups like banks, non-banks, development banks, merchant banks,securities firms, insurance companies etc., however, may not always convey anymeaningful signal. In bank dominated financial systems, the emphasis, therefore, hasbeen on aggregating the information first across banks, then extending it to otherinstitutions over time. Monitoring is also exercised over different groups separately at5techniques to draw useful conclusions.from occurrence of financial frauds.“avoidance of market failure”.would be preferable to move to best practices irrespective of other country practices.conclusion does not in any way group level. Group level analysis that clearly tracks inter-group exposures partlyFifthly, despite the apparent emphasis on their voluntary adoption, there is adanger that incentives and sanctions linked to standard setting will become features ofIMF surveillance and conditionality. In such a scenario, publication of information onthe compliance status, particularly the information presented in the ROSC reports, isfraught with the danger of classifying the countries into performers and non-performers. Even when the international agencies associated with the work onstandards and codes may not intend so, once the information is disseminated, it ispossible that credit rating agencies may assign country ratings on the basis of thelevels of achievement of standards.  Internal assessments and external evaluationsunder Article-IV and FSAP by the Fund-Bank have, therefore, to be extremelycautious about the dissemination of information on a country’s compliance status. Thepolicy makers, who shoulder the responsibility for developing markets while at thesame time avoiding market instabilities must retain full discretion on their ownBriefly stated, the recent international initiatives in regard to standards andcodes provide at best a partial solution to the problems of existing internationalfinancial architecture. Furthermore, in the context of a crisis, they provide solutions atdomestic level for issues that may often originate outside the country. Finally, they donot assure international financial stability although they may contribute to it. Yet,there are several reasons why public policy and national authorities need to focus onthe international standards and codes and these reasons centre around both efficiencyand stability of financial sector in the country. In this context, a desirable approach tothe consideration of international standards and codes can be explored in nationalinterest.As mentioned earlier, standards are not totally new. The current internationaleffort is only to codify best practices and disseminate widely to member countries sothat the domestic markets in a globalised environment will grow and integrate inharmony without destabilisation.  The role of financial sector as also the otherinstitutional arrangements for efficient economic activity has been extensivelydebated in the past.  One issue is whether the market behaviour has to be viewed froma normative angle passing ‘value judgments’ or the market behaviour should be takenas ‘rational’ or ‘commercial’ behaviour.  This leads to the wider debate between Stateversus Market and the role of the regulator over markets.  History has taught lessonsthat while markets have a key role to play, there are limits to market leading at times to crisis situation. It is necessary to recognize that just as the natureand functioning of ‘State’ has some variations as between countries, the working ofWhen a country gets globalised, the domestic institutional, legal and otherstructures have to be in reasonable harmony with international best practices.Otherwise, international flows cannot freely respond to market signals andinformation.  Therefore, the risks arising in domestic markets can spill over asinternational or cross border risks. It is in the light of the increasing global crossborder flows and handling of risks arising thereby, that the acceptance and adherenceof international best practices assume significance.  While the standards and best6practices may not uniformly apply and the relevance and applicability may differ frommarkets also varies among countries.behaviourDesirable Approach at National Leveldissemination policy.addresses the problem of aggregation for the system as a whole.country to country, as a medium and longer term endeavour, development ofinternational best practices in any country may be viewed in the best interest of sound,stable and efficient financial structure.Although the standards have evolved in the context of international stability,they have enormous efficiency-enhancing value by themselves. Standards bythemselves may be presumed to be, prima facie , desirable, and it is, therefore, in thenational interest to develop institutional mechanisms for consideration of internationalstandards. Thus, the implementation of standards needs to be given a domestic focuswith the objectives of market development and enhancing domestic market efficiency.Some standards keep evolving and it is important to keep close track of developmentin these areas. It also needs to be recognized that the process is evolutionary and saytwo years down the line, present standards themselves can change, in degree andIn a broad sense, it can be held that all standards are, in some way or other,relevant for all the countries though the extent of relevance, scope for application andurgency of implementation may differ depending upon the stage of development also the country specific, legal and institutional structures. In particular, in which do not have developed markets, the entire market development has to be givengreater weight than mere application of standards.  In the case of such economies, theadvantage is that since they are starting on a clean slate, the standards and bestpractices could be easily incorporated as they go along with the development ofWhile there can be no uniform prioritisation of standards relevant for allcountries, it is possible to place, on a universal basis considerable emphasis uponcertain specific areas depending on individual country circumstances. To quote theTask Force on Implementation of Standards chaired by Andrew Sheng (2000 ) :“prioritization of standards for implementation must necessarily vary from economyto economy, taking into consideration their current status in observance of standards,economic circumstances, financial structures, legal and institutional frameworks, andpolicy priorities. A balance would need to be struck between international andcountries though there could be different approaches. For instance, it would be easierto implement standards in areas, which have been substantially developed. On thecontrary, the prioritization for a particular country could consider the identification of‘weak areas’. The weak areas may be, for example, weak legal base leading to legaluncertainties, lack of regulation leading to lack of regulatory norms, etc. It may also be possible to classify the standards in a conceptual frameworkunder three broad elements, viz., technical, policy and socio-cultural. Standards likeSDDS, accounting and auditing, and supervision may be classified as purely technicaland, therefore, easily amenable to implementation. Standards on monetary andfinancial policies, fiscal transparency and securities regulation have certain policyimplications and would form an integral part of the economic reform process in manydeveloping countries. The changes in these areas depend on timing, sequencing andcomplementarity in related areas and availability of institutional, technological andlegal infrastructure. Nevertheless, while it is desirable to adopt these standardsquickly, it actually boils down to an issue of managing of policy reforms in a non-disruptive fashion. Finally, standards in the areas of corporate governance, insurance7It would be useful to explore parameters for prioritization in respect of specificdomestic considerations”.institutions and markets.economiesasdetail though not in kind.and to a certain extent insolvency and bankruptcy practices take a It is also possible to attempt a construct of the link between transparency andmacroeconomic policy. Good macroeconomic policy and good standards is perhapsan ideal situation for a country. Good macroeconomic policy and poor transparencythough not ideal is perhaps not risky by itself. Bad macroeconomic policy and goodtransparency has large elements of risk and warrants change in policy beforelaunching into transparency. The most risky combination perhaps is badmacroeconomic policy and bad standards. In a more dynamic sense, it can be arguedIt is difficult to attempt an exhaustive or universally applicable account ofpractical issues in implementation of standards and codes since they are country-specific. It is, however, worth exploring, albeit hesitatingly, some generalFirst, while transparency and financial stability appear fundamentallycomplementary, there could be a trade off at some point.  Therefore, codes should beincluding the structure of reporting should depend not only on constitutional, legaland institutional mechanisms but also the likely impact of dissemination on the many codes emphasise legislative provisions in a concrete manner.Legislation provides the shield or back up for such actions.  The emphasis of thecodes should be to promote a general effort to improve legislative provisions and it isnecessary to recognise that the process of legislation is time consuming and complex.While it is essential to recognize the importance of legislation, given its complexity,Thirdly, the implementation of monetary policy is centralised with a singleauthority, generally the central bank, while the implementation of financial policiespertaining to various sectors like non-bank financial institutions, insurance, securitiesmarkets and payments and settlement may rest with different institutions.  While thestandards and codes could be taken as umbrella ones for all institutions, differentaspects of implementation have to be dealt with separately for different sectors. Thisis necessary because the objectives of the institutions may differ fundamentally.  Forexample, banking emphasises depositor protection whereas in the case of securitiesmarket, it is investor protection. The payment and settlement system has hugesystemic risk associated with it and in the case of insurance , the emphasis is uponasset protection. Such differences lead to basic differences in the approach and and, therefore, it would be useful to address implementation aspectsFourthly, in implementing the Codes, since there is a multiplicity ofinstitutions or arrangements for regulating different financial sector segments likeinsurance, banking, securities markets and payment and settlement, overall approachto cover different agencies in overlapping/ grey areas of regulation become important.In the absence of well-defined regulatory roles and responsibilities combined withover-viewing or overseeing arrangements, there are possibilities for regulatorygaps/overlaps leading to regulatory arbitrage by market agencies.

An optimal balance between regulation and competitive efficiency inthe financial system and markets can be achieved only with equal emphasis onresponsibility and accountability of the private sector. The focus of IMF is also withregard to codes mostly in respect of regulators and not so much with private sector.International accounting standards and standards set by securities market associationsare, no doubt, expected to cover issues relating to private sector market participants.Every effort should be made to Sixthly, financial agencies may be justified not to disclose some policymeasures which are in progress, contingency plans, corrective actions, emergencylending decisions and supervisory or enforcement actions.  Revealing of suchinformation could be based upon case-by-case deliberations and no standardisation ispossible in such cases. It should also be emphasised that the transparency practicesmay not be the same and the relevance and applicability of practices may differbetween financial sector agencies.  For instance, ‘market efficiency’ should berelevant more for securities regulatory authority; the ‘market and systemic stability’would be more relevant for a central bank and other supervisory agencies; and ‘client-asset protection’ would be more relevant for institutions like Deposit InsuranceSeventhly, the practice evolved in India is in finding solutions through aparticipatory/consultative approach even on major policy issues.

The approach toimplementation of financial standards and codes is based on the efficiency-enhancingelements of the standards and codes, and on the need to consider them as part ofprocess of institutional development in the country, while not ignoring their relevanceto domestic as well as international financial stability. The emphasis is on creatingawareness to promote adoption by the relevant official agencies, self-regulating bodiesand market participants rather than prescribing compliance at the instance of a centralIn order to facilitate positioning of international financial standards and codesin relevant areas of the financial system in India and to guide the overall process of9authority.in India in the implementation of standards and codes.time job.changes while developing better acceptance among economic agents.Companies.recognise and correct the asymmetry.accountability thereof is still heavily concentrated in the official sector.

The Committee has also been asked to considerplotting a road map for aligning India’s standards and practices as necessary anddesirable in the light of evolving international practices, periodically reviewing thestatus and progress in regard to the codes and practices; and reaching out its reportson the above to all concerned organizations in public or private sectors.The Standing Committee has constituted Advisory Groups in ten core subjectareas, which broadly encompass  the twelve key areas prescribed by FSF, pertainingto the financial system. These are: Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies,Data Dissemination, Payments and Settlement System, Banking Supervision,Securities Market Regulation, Accounting and Auditing, Fiscal Transparency,Insurance Regulation, Bankruptcy Laws and Corporate Governance. Accounting andauditing have been clubbed together and the twelfth area namely ‘Market Integrity’associated with the forty recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force(FATF) on money laundering is not being presently looked into by the StandingCommittee.
