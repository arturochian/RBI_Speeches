Coping With Liquidity Management in India: A Practitioner's View   Rakesh Mohan     "Liquidity Management in India" is a subject that is not widely discussed but is the  bread and butter of daily monetary management. Whereas I was not a monetary  specialist prior to coming to the Reserve Bank, I have been able to gather some insights  through on-the-job training. It is also an issue of current relevance and appeal.  Conduct of monetary policy and management in the context of large and volatile  capital flows has proved to be difficult for many countries. As India became convertible on  the current account, and liberalised its capital account in a carefully sequenced manner  since the balance of payment crisis of 1991, it too has been faced with similar problems.  The evolving policy mix involved careful calibration that took into account diverse  objectives of central banking, changes in the monetary policy framework and operating  procedures, and widening of the set of instruments for liquidity management.   Before opening of the economy through the 1990s, both the current and capital  accounts were controlled. However, despite trade restrictions the current account was in  constant deficit, which had to be financed mostly by debt, both official aid flows and  private debt. Portfolio flows were not permitted and foreign direct investment was  negligible. The only largely "uncontrolled" flows were NRI deposits, which waxed and  waned according to macro-economic conditions. The exchange rate was also controlled:  it was linked to a basket of currencies and moved as a crawling peg. Consequently,  monetary policy management, such as it was, did not pose serious problems, particularly  since most interest rates were fixed administratively.   It is only after substantial opening of the economy, and deregulation of interest  rates that price discovery of the rate of interest has become important. Consequently the  Reserve Bank has had to experiment on a continuous basis. It has had to operate  simultaneously on the external account in the foreign exchange market to contain  volatility in the exchange rate, and in the domestic market to contain volatility in interest  rates. Since both the exchange rate and interest rate are the key prices reflecting the cost  of money, it is particularly important for the efficient functioning of the economy that they  be market determined and be easily observed. Excessive fluctuation and volatility masks  the underlying value and gives rise to confusing signals. The task of liquidity management  then is to provide a framework for the facilitation of forex and money market transactions  that result in price discovery sans excessive volatility.                                                        th   Based on the addresses of Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at 36 Gujarat Economic Association at  N.

Liquidity Management and Management of Capital Flows  Let me begin with some general remarks on liquidity management and  management of capital flows.   While in the macroeconomic context, liquidity management refers to overall  monetary conditions, reflecting the extent of mismatch between demand and supply of  overall monetary resources, for a central bank, the concept of liquidity management  typically refers to the framework and set of instruments that the central bank follows in  steering the amount of bank reserves in order to control its price, consistent with the  ultimate goals of monetary policy (Bindseil, 2000). What is the price of bank reserves?  The price of bank reserves is fixed in terms of short term interest rates. This is set in  terms of overnight inter-bank borrowing and lending rates either secured or unsecured  which affect the reserves that the banks keep. As markets do not clear often on their own  the central bank itself steps in by influencing the short-term interest rates by affecting  short-term repurchase obligations with banks (Borio, 1997).   The need for liquidity management arises from central banks concept of liquidity  measured in terms of the monetary base, of which it is the monopoly supplier. The supply  of monetary base by the central bank depends on (i) the public's demand for currency, as  determined by the size of monetary transactions and the opportunity cost of holding  money and, (ii) the banking systems need for reserves to settle or discharge payment  obligations. In fulfilling these needs, central banks also attempt to control and modulate  liquidity conditions by varying the supply of bank reserves to meet its macroeconomic  objectives subject to the constraint of financial stability. Bank reserves are, therefore,  influenced through reserve requirements or open market operations. In so doing, central  banks attempt to affect the level of short-term interest rates in a manner in which market  movements of these interest rate movements are smoothened out as volatility of any  monetary or non-monetary asset prices can be costly in terms of real output and  investment decisions.  It is from this standpoint that a central bank decides to modulate its  market operations over a chosen time horizon to reflect its policy stance.  The importance of central bank liquidity management lies in its ability to exercise  considerable influence and control over short-term interest rates by small money market  operations.  This ability is determined by the credibility of the central bank itself.  The  interventions that the central bank makes have a pronounced signaling affect.   Consequently, developed country central banks typically aim at a target overnight interest  rate, which acts as a powerful economy wide signal. As a result, the impact of these  transactions is fundamentally different from those undertaken by private market  participants.  The liquidity management function of a central bank involves a larger  economy-wide perspective.  Central bank liquidity management has short-term effects in  financial markets.  However, the long-term implications for the real sector and on price  level are more important.   By operating on the current account balances that the commercial banks maintain  with the central bank or by directly operating on the short-term money market rate, central   2banks attempt to influence money market liquidity in order to exercise control over the  short-term interest rate. The central bank may directly set at least one of the short-term  interest rates that acts as its policy rate. By controlling the short-term interest rate while  letting markets determine the rest of the yield curve, the central bank attempts to transmit  monetary policy impulses across the yield curve. The sovereign yield curve in turn  influences the lending and deposit rates in the economy. Mortgage rates are found to be  particularly sensitive to the policy rate changes through the interest rate as well as the  credit channel. Once bank lending gets affected, interest rates impact real variables such  as consumption and investment, which in turn impact output and inflation levels. So while  active liquidity management has a localised objective of keeping short-term interest rates  range bound, it also has a long-term meta objective of implementing monetary policy  goals of inflation and output.  The difficulty is that monetary policy is formulated and implemented under  considerable uncertainty.  Injections or absorptions made over extended periods as an  intended part of policy have implications on output and prices through changes in interest  rates and aggregate demand.  Typically, the transmission effects tend to differ across  countries depending on country specific factors and institutional and regulatory  frameworks.  As transmission occurs with long and variable lags in all countries, the long- run impact is often unpredictable.  While liquidity management in most advanced country central banks is conducted  in a setting where daily demand for money typically exceeds its supply, liquidity  management in emerging markets is more varied, with surplus and shortage conditions  alternating and with perhaps greater fluctuations in their external accounts (Saggar,  2006). In recent years, capital flows have been a major factor affecting liquidity  management in a large number of countries, particularly in Asia, which have faced large  and volatile capital flows. Capital flows have little effect on liquidity in the presence of  equivalent current account deficits that result in the absorption of capital flows in the  economy and they help to accelerate growth in investment, employment and in  technology imports, contributing to productivity growth. In situations where they exceed  the current account deficit, they result in a build up of foreign exchange reserves, which  themselves act as a positive signaling device indicating financial stability.   But unsterilised capital inflows can result in inflation, currency appreciation, loss of  competitiveness and attenuation of monetary control. The loss of monetary control could  be steep if such flows are large. Even when these flows are sterilised through open  market operations the costs could be large when sterilisation operations raise domestic  interest rates and result in the trap of even greater capital flows. The fiscal impact of  sterilisation also requires to be factored in, specially when a large stock of securities is  required to be issued for the purpose.    Clearly, macroeconomic policy options for managing capital flows are difficult. The  options also require taking into account the high volatility often associated with such  capital flows. These flows are marked by sudden surges and reversals, which in some  cases, could occur in a weeks time or less. In other cases, surges could be followed by   3stoppages in a short span of time. Stoppages could also give way to reversals at slight  triggers. There are also cases where capital flows are sustained over a long period of  time or a drought in flows occurs over a medium-term.  In sum, these flows are somewhat  unpredictable and it is very difficult to assess the liquidity scenario even over a quarter,  far less over a year. At the same time, monetary policy operates with transmission lags  that could run 3-4 quarters or longer and these lags are often unpredictable.    Typically, countries that are in the quest for capital flows fall under the impossible  trinity problem, referred to earlier. Notwithstanding the theoretical basis, history is replete  with examples of countries falling under the temptation to achieve all these goals when  faced with opportunities for benefiting from global asset portfolio allocations (Obstfeld,  Shambaugh, and Taylor, 2004). Generally, countries seek to retain their monetary policy  independence as they face asymmetric shocks and common currency area conditions are  not pervasive. They are also tempted to keep their exchange rates stable for financial  stability or for inflation containment objectives. In most cases countries end up making a  costly exit from a hard peg. With greater financial openness, many countries have to  move towards greater exchange rate flexibility or accept the subordination of monetary  policy goals to goals of global capital market integration. The latter, however, could be  costly.    Let me now turn to our own situation and how we have coped with the evolving  circumstances in India.    Capital Flows in India   The far reaching economic reforms in India in the 1990s, witnessed a sharp  increase in capital inflows as a result of capital account liberalisation in India and a  gradual decrease in home bias in asset allocation in advanced economies. During 1990- 91, it was clear that the country was heading for a balance of payment crisis caused by  increased absorption due to deficit financed fiscal expansion of the 1980s and the trigger  of oil price spike caused by the Gulf War. As foreign exchange reserves dwindled to less  than a months import financing requirements in 1991, global capital taps got switched off  and the country faced a real possibility of a first ever sovereign default. Crisis managers  got active and averted the default, leaving the country still with a default-free history. The  survival stimuli it kindled, unleashed massive economic reforms. The reform story has  been told several times in many different fora and I do not intend to repeat it here.      Foreign investment flows, mainly in the form of foreign direct investments,  averaged US$118 million during 1990-91 and 1991-92. A significant change in our capital  account took place when portfolio investments by foreign institutional investors were  permitted in 1992.  With the exception of 1998-99 when, in the aftermath of contagion  from East Asian financial crisis, portfolio flows turned negative, total foreign investment in  the form of direct and portfolio investment was US$ 4-8 billion a year till 2002-03.  Excluding 1998-99, it has averaged nearly US$ 5.8 billion over a 9-year period starting  1993-94. There was another quantum leap in the following two years  2003-04 and   42004-05 with direct investment averaging US$ 5.1 billion and portfolio investment  averaging US$ 10.1 billion, taking total foreign investment exceeding US$ 15 billion. As it  happened, this increase in capital flows coincided with a slowdown in the economy,  particularly the industrial economy after 1997-98, and instead of current account deficits  we had current account surpluses.  Consequently, even ignoring the non-resident deposit  flows, equity investment flows in themselves posed a considerable challenge for  monetary management.   While the year to year foreign investment flows provide some idea of the  magnitude of the capital flows that may be required to be sterilised, the month-to-month  or intra-month variations in these flows provide a better idea of the volatility of these flows  with which central bank liquidity management has to cope and these variations have been  sizeable. They have been dominated by portfolio flows. While these flows appeared to be  mean reverting till October 2002, there appears to have been a strong trend with wider  oscillations subsequently. This means that the monetary authorities now have to cope  with larger and more volatile capital flows than it had been faced with in about a decade  from the onset of reforms.   Faced with these large capital flows, there has been a steep accretion to foreign  exchange reserves starting October 2000. Over US$ 100 billion have been added in  foreign exchange reserves since then, taking them from US$ 34.9 billion to US$ 143.6  billion in October 2005.  IMD redemptions saw the reserves temporarily dropping to US$  135 billion at end-December 2005 but the reserves are back at US$ 146.2 billion by  March 17, 2006 (Chart 1). The reserve accretion of this large magnitude has been largely  the result of massive capital flows. The capital flows are adding to absorption directly as  well as indirectly through increased domestic credit growth and have resulted in a steep  rise in trade deficit and, till at least recently, substantial excess liquidity in the economy.  The problem of scarcity of 1991 is now seen as a problem of plenty by many.

First, it had to distinguish implicitly between durable flows and transient flows. If capital  flows are deemed to be durable and indefinite, questions arise regarding foreign  exchange management. If the flows are deemed to be semi-durable, essentially reflecting  the business cycle, the task of monetary and liquidity management is to smoothen out  their impact on the domestic economy, finding means to absorb liquidity in times of  surplus and to inject it in times of deficit. Second, in the short term, daily, weekly or  monthly volatility in flows needs to be smoothened to minimise the effect on domestic  overnight interest rates. In practice, ex-ante, it is difficult to distinguish what is durable,  what is semi-durable and what is transient. Hence policy and practice effectively operates  in an environment of uncertainty and a variety of instruments have to be used to manage  liquidity in this fluid scenario.      Shift from Direct to Indirect Instruments   There has been a worldwide trend for shifting from direct instruments of monetary  control to indirect instruments (Alexander, Balino and Enoch, 1995). India is one of the  emerging market countries, where such a change has distinctly occurred. A major  transformation has occurred in the monetary policy framework in the 1990s. In response  to the changing financial landscape, the Reserve Bank adopted several policy changes  which transformed the monetary policy framework.   Monetary policy had to respond to the challenge posed by the problem of plenty,  which required liquidity management to be honed up to meet the new challenge. Major  institutional changes since 1991 have supported the possibility of transition in the  monetary policy framework. Credit ceilings were removed, though directed lending was  retained. Interest rates were freed with the exception of the saving deposit rate, some  NRI deposit rates and lending rates for loans of below Rs 2 lakh. From a completely  managed float, the exchange rate was made market determined and the rupee was made  fully convertible on the current account, while the capital account was substantially  liberalised. Automatic monetisation of budget deficits was stopped with the signing of the  Supplemental Accord in 1997. Yields on gilts were made market determined, while the  pricing of primary stock market issues were freed. With financial innovations, money  demand was seen to be less stable than before and disequilibrium in money markets had  begun to be reflected in short-term interest rates. The exchange rate had become  endogenous to money, income, prices and interest rates. There is increasing evidence of  increased integration among various financial markets. The money market has integrated  substantially with the foreign exchange market at the short-end. Furthermore, foreign  exchange market efficiency was found to hold at the short-end. The term structure was  still somewhat segmented but some transmission across the yield curve was in evidence.     In response to the changing financial landscape, the Reserve Bank adopted  several policy changes that transformed the monetary policy framework. Reserve  requirements in the form of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) were brought down from the   6statutory maximum of 15 per cent of net demand and time liabilities during July 1989 to  April 1993 to 4.5 per cent in June 2003, which was raised subsequently to 5.0 per cent in  two stages in October 2004. The Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), which directs banks to  maintain liquid investments, mainly in the form of government securities, was reduced  from an all time high of 38.5 per cent in January 1993 to the statutory minimum of 25 per  cent by October 1997.  Legislation has now been introduced in Parliament to remove both  the statutory minimum for SLR and CRR in order to provide for greater monetary policy  flexibility.  From the point of monetary policy framework, the significant development was the  move to a "multiple indicator approach from 1998. Prior to the mid-1980s, monetary  policy was based predominantly on direct instruments of monetary control with credit  budgets for the banks being framed in sync with monetary budgeting. In view of the  institutional changes stated in this section and the subsequent one, the Reserve Bank  formally shifted its policy framework from monetary targeting to the multiple indicator  approach since 1998-99.  As part of this approach, it started using the information content  in interest rates and rates of return in different markets along with currency, credit, fiscal  position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinancing and transactions in  foreign exchange, juxtaposing it with output data for drawing policy perspectives.     Liquidity Management through Indirect Instruments: Early Trends  Before the advent of repos, market operations by the RBI almost invariably  focused on open market operations through outright transactions in government  securities. The scope of open market operations in the earlier period was limited as yields  were repressed by an administered interest rate regime, including auctions of T-bills on  tap at fixed coupon of 4.6 per cent. The move towards a market determined system of  interest rates began by development of the secondary market by increasing coupons and  1 decreasing maturity of government debt . The yields were made substantially market  2 determined by introduction of auctions since the mid-1980s. The Reserve Bank  3 introduced reverse repos for absorption from December 1992 . With the objective of  improving short-term management of liquidity in the system and to smoothen out interest  rates in the call/notice money market, the Reserve Bank began absorbing excess liquidity  through auctions of reverse repos (then called repos). The development of repos into a  full fledged monetary instrument in the form of LAF has been a fascinating case study of  what it takes to undertake changes in operating framework. The chronology of these  developments is provided in Box-I. Till 2003-04, market operations were primarily                                                    1  During 1985-86 to 1997-98, the maximum coupon rate was increased from 6.5 per cent to 11.5 per cent.  The maximum maturity was brought down from 30 to 20 years.   2  T-bills auctions introduced included 182-days T-bills in November 1986, 364-days T-bills in April 1992 and  91-days T-bills in January 1993.   3  The nomenclature used at that time was repos for absorption and reverse repos for injections.  Internationally, as a matter of practice, central banks generally use the term 'repo' for liquidity injections. Repo  is defined as an instrument to borrow funds. The central banks choose to use the term from the market's point  of view. RBI adopted this usage effective October 29, 2004 and the terms repo and reverse repo in this paper  are used consistently as per this new definition.   7conducted in the form of outright sales and purchases of government securities (Chart-2).  Since then, LAF volumes have increased considerable (Chart-3). The important  contribution of LAF has been in keeping overnight interest rates by and large range  bound. With the activation of bank rate as a policy instrument, reverse repos helped in  creating an informal corridor in the money market, with the reverse repo rate as floor and  the Bank Rate as the ceiling. The use of these two instruments enabled RBI to keep the  call rate by and large within this informal corridor.

LAF was introduced on the basis of uniform price auctions, but  the auction system was switched to multiple price auctions from May 5, 2001 (Box - I).   8 Rs. crore Rs.

As part of the financial sector reforms launched in mid-1991,  India began to move away from direct instruments of monetary control to indirect ones. The transition of  this kind involves considerable efforts to develop markets, institutions and practices. In order to facilitate  such transition, India developed a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) in phases considering country- specific features of the Indian financial system. LAF is based on repo / reverse repo operations by the  central bank.  In 1998 the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Narasimham Committee II) recommended  the introduction of a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) under which the Reserve Bank would conduct  auctions periodically, if not necessarily daily. The Reserve Bank could reset its Repo and Reverse Repo  rates which would in a sense provide a reasonable corridor for the call money market.  In pursuance of  these recommendations, a major change in the operating procedure became possible in April 1999  through the introduction of an Interim Liquidity Adjustment Facility (ILAF) under which repos and  reverse repos were formalised. With the introduction of ILAF, the general refinance facility was  withdrawn and replaced by a collateralised lending facility (CLF) up to 0.25 per cent of the fortnightly  average outstanding of aggregate deposits in 1997-98 for two weeks at the Bank Rate. Additional  collateralised lending facility (ACLF) for an equivalent amount of CLF was made available at the Bank  Rate plus 2 per cent. CLF and ACLF availed for periods beyond two weeks were subjected to a penal  rate of 2 per cent for an additional two week period. Export Credit refinance for scheduled commercial  banks was retained and continued to be provided at the bank rate. Liquidity support to PDs against  collateral of government securities at the bank rate was also provided for. ILAF was expected to  promote stability of money market and ensure that the interest rates move within a reasonable range.  The transition from ILAF to a full-fledged LAF began in June 2000 and was undertaken in three  stages. In the first stage, beginning June 5, 2000, LAF was formally introduced and the Additional CLF  and level II support to PDs was replaced by variable rate repo auctions with same day settlement. In the  second stage, beginning May 2001 CLF and level I liquidity support for banks and PDs was also  replaced by variable rate repo auctions. Some minimum liquidity support to PDs was continued but at  interest rate linked to variable rate in the daily repos auctions as determined by RBI from time to time. In  April 2003, the multiplicity of rates at which liquidity was being absorbed/injected under back-stop facility  was rationalised and the back-stop interest rate was fixed at the reverse repo cut-off rate at the regular  LAF auctions on that day. In case of no reverse repo in the LAF auctions, back-stop rate was fixed at  2.0 percentage point above the repo cut-off rate. It was also announced that on days when no  repo/reverse repo bids are received/accepted, back-stop rate would be decided by the Reserve Bank  on an ad-hoc basis. A revised LAF scheme was operationalised effective March 29, 2004 under which  the reverse repo rate was reduced to 6.0 per cent and aligned with bank rate. Normal facility and  backstop facility was merged into a single facility and made available at a single rate. The third stage of  full-fledged LAF had begun with the full computerisation of Public Debt Office (PDO) and introduction of  RTGS marked a big step forward in this phase. Repo operations today are mainly through electronic  transfers. Fixed rate auctions have been reintroduced since April 2004. The possibility of operating LAF  at different times of the same day is now close to getting materialised. In that sense we have very  nearly completed the transition to operating a full-fledged LAF.   With the introduction of Second LAF (SLAF) from November 28, 2005 market participants now  have a second window to fine-tune the management of liquidity. In past, LAF operations were  conducted in the forenoon between 9.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. SLAF is conducted by receiving bids  between 3.00 p.m. and 3.45 p.m. The salient features of SLAF are the same as those of LAF and the  settlement for both is conducted separately and on gross basis.   The introduction of LAF has been a process and the Indian experience shows that phased  rather than a big bang approach is required for reforms in the financial sector and in monetary  management.

First and foremost, it helped the transition from direct instruments of monetary  control to indirect and, in the process, certain dead weight loss for the system was  saved.    Second, it has provided monetary authorities with greater flexibility in determining  both the quantum of adjustment as well as the rates by responding to the needs of  the system on a daily basis.    Third, it enabled the Reserve Bank to modulate the supply of funds on a daily  basis to meet day-to-day liquidity mismatches.    Fourth, it enabled the central bank to affect demand for funds through policy rate  changes.    Fifth and most important, it helped stabilise short-term money market rates.  The call rate has been largely within a corridor set by the repo and reverse repo  rates, imparting greater stability in the financial markets. As has been mentioned, the  emergence of corridor was gradual.  The transition is not a menu choice as is sometimes  viewed in text books.  LAF has now emerged as the principal operating instrument of monetary policy.  Although there is no formal targeting of overnight interest rates, the LAF is designed to  nudge overnight interest rates within a specified corridor, the difference between the  fixed repo and reverse repo rates, currently 100 basic points.  The LAF has enabled the  Reserve Bank to de-emphasise targeting of bank reserves and focus increasingly on  interest rates. This has helped in reducing the CRR without loss of monetary control.    Liquidity Management in the More Recent Period  Let me now focus on our experience in liquidity management in recent years. After  the introduction of the second stage of LAF in May 2001, liquidity has generally been in  surplus mode with the increase in levels of capital flows and in the presence of a current  account surplus until 2003-04. With the continuing accretion to foreign exchange  reserves, there was corresponding injection of liquidity that had to be strerilised. At the  same time, the reverse repo policy interest rate was reduced in successive steps from 6  per cent in March 2002 to 4.5 per cent by August 2003 before raising it to 5.50 per cent  by January 2006 in four increases of 25 basis points each. Thus, the aim of monetary  policy was to keep overnight call money market rates in the system within the informal  interest rate corridor.  On the whole, LAF has had a pronounced favourable impact of lowering volatility  of short-term money market rates. Monthly average call rates, which were volatile in a 5- 35 per cent band during 1990-98, have clearly stabilised subsequently and have  generally ranged between 5-10 percent (Chart 4).  Call rates have become largely  bounded by the informal interest rate corridor after the introduction of LAF (Chart 5). The   10corridor between repo and reverse repo rates which was set at 200 basis points initially  and was widened to 250 basis points in August 2003 was lowered to 150 basis points in  March 2004, to 125 basis points in October 2004 and further to 100 basis points in April  2005. The call rates have remained anchored around the lower corridor since June 2002,  except for a brief period during February-April 2003 and between October 2004 and  January 2005. Again since October 2005, the system appears to have clearly moved from  enduring surplus to marginal deficits.

This was accomplished by the simultaneous operation of the LAF and open  market operations.    Given that RBI had a finite stock of government securities its ability to mop up  large capital inflows indefinitely was therefore limited, and LAF operations began to bear  the burden of stabilisation disproportionately. Moreover, the LAF is essentially designed  to take care of fictional liquidity on a day-to-day basis, hence its function was itself  beginning to get distorted by such a sterilisation.      Box-II: Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS)    The money markets operated in liquidity surplus mode since 2002 due to large capital inflows  and current account surplus. The initial burden of sterilisation was borne by the outright transaction of  dated securities and T-bills. However, due to the depletion in stock of government securities, the burden  of liquidity adjustment shifted on LAF, which is essentially a tool of adjusting for marginal liquidity.  Keeping in view the objective of absorbing the liquidity of enduring nature using instruments other than  LAF, the Reserve Bank appointed a Working Group on Instruments of Sterilisation (Chairperson: Smt  Usha Thorat). The Group recommended issue of T-bills and dated securities under Market Stabilisation  Scheme (MSS) where the proceeds of MSS were to be held by the Government in a separate  identifiable cash account maintained and operated by RBI. The amounts credited into the MSS Account  would be appropriated only for the purpose of redemption and / or buy back of the Treasury Bills and /  or dated securities issued under the MSS.  In pursuance of the recommendation the Government of  India and RBI signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on March 25, 2004. As part of the MoU,  the scheme was made operational since April 2004. It was agreed that the Government would issue  Treasury Bills and/or dated securities under the MSS in addition to the normal borrowing requirements,  for absorbing liquidity from the system. These securities would be issued by way of auctions by the  Reserve Bank and the instruments would have all the attributes of existing T-bills and dated securities.  They were to be serviced like any other marketable government securities. MSS securities are being  treated as eligible securities for Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), repo and Liquidity Adjustment Facility  (LAF).   The payments for interest and discount on MSS securities are not made from the MSS  Account. The receipts due to premium and/or accrued interest are also not credited to the MSS  Account. Such receipts and payments towards interest, premium and discount are shown in the budget  and other related documents as distinct components under separate sub-heads. The T-bills and dated  securities issued for the purpose of the MSS are matched by an equivalent cash balance held by the  Government with the Reserve Bank. Thus, they only have a marginal impact on revenue and fiscal  balances of the Government to the extent of interest payment on the outstanding under the MSS.    For mopping up enduring surplus liquidity, policy choice exist between central bank issuing its  own securities or government issuing additional securities. A large number of countries, such as, Chile,  China, Colombia, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, Tawian and  Thailand have issued central bank securities. However, central banks of many of these countries faced  deterioration in their balance sheets. As such, there are merits in issuing sterilisation bonds on  government account. This is more so, in case of an already well established government debt market,  where issuing of new central bank bills of overlapping maturity could cause considerable confusion and  possible market segmentation which could obfuscate the yield curve, reduce liquidity of the instruments  and make operations that much more difficult.    MSS has considerably strengthened the Reserve Bank's ability to conduct exchange rate and  monetary management operations. It has allowed absorption of surplus liquidity by instruments of short  term (91-day, 182-day and 364-day T-bills) and the medium-term (dated Government securities)  maturity. Generally, the preference has been for the short-term instruments. This has given the  monetary authorities a greater degree of freedom in liquidity management during transitions in liquidity  situation.    Reference:  RBI (2003), Report of the Working Group on Instruments of Sterlisation, Mumbai: Reserve Bank of  India, December 2003.   12In order to address these issues the Reserve Bank appointed a Working Group on  Instruments of Sterilisation (Chairperson: Smt. Usha Thorat). After considerable  discussion, the consequence was that the Reserve Bank signed a Memorandum of  Understanding (MoU) with the Government of India for the issuance of Treasury Bills and  dated Government Securities under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) on March 25,  2004. The new instrument empowered the Reserve Bank to undertake liquidity absorption  on a more enduring but still temporary basis. The objective is to keep LAF for fine tuning  on a day-to-day basis, while using MSS to manage sterlisation operations, along with the  use of more conventional open market operations (OMO) for the absorption or injection of  liquidity on an even more enduring basis. The major features of the MSS are enumerated  in Box-II.  As has been explained (Box-II), proceeds of the MSS are held by the Government  in a separate identifiable cash account maintained and operated by the Reserve Bank.  The amount held in this account is appropriated only for the purpose of redemption and/or  buyback of the Treasury Bills and/or dated securities issued under the MSS.  The ceiling  on the outstanding amount under MSS was fixed initially at Rs. 60,000 crore but in  accordance with the MOU provisions was enhanced to Rs. 80,000 crore (discounted  value) on October 14, 2004 and has now been reduced again to Rs.70,000 crore. The  total outstanding amount absorbed under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) had  increased to over Rs.78,906 crore as on September 2, 2005 but has been unwinding  since then and the outstandings have currently dropped to Rs 30,000 crore. Nearly Rs.  50,000 crore of liquidity has been released through MSS unwinding, even while overall  marginal liquidity has transited from surplus to deficit.  The introduction of MSS had succeeded in restoring LAF to its intended function  of daily liquidity management.  With MSS levels averaging about Rs.54,000 crore in  November 2004, total surplus liquidity averaged around the levels seen before the  introduction of MSS as excess capital flows continued. LAF operations returned to  surplus mode thereafter and by March 2005 averaged around Rs.30,000 crore with total  surplus liquidity as reflected in LAF, MSS and government cash balances in the vicinity of  Rs.1,15,000 crore. By September 2005, total surplus liquidity had surpassed Rs.1,20,000  crore. However, the liquidity situation has changed significantly since then.  With the  change in stance of monetary policy, hiking of the policy rate four times by 25 bps each  since the start of October 2004, high credit growth and bulk redemptions of IMD liability of  US$ 7.1 billion.  LAF levels again turned to neutral levels in December 2005 and there  have been liquidity injections through LAF thereafter (Chart-6).    Credit growth has witnessed a sea change since mid-2004.  Thus, the growth in  non food credit in 2004-05 was over 30 per cent, the highest in 35 years.  In recent years  the banks had been subscribing to government securities much higher than the minimum  SLR requirements.  Making a forward looking assessment, the Reserve Bank began to  unwind MSS from September 2005 and the MSS part in the weekly auctions was  discontinued since November 9, 2005. This helped in the orderly withdrawal of liquidity  equivalent to US$7.1 billion involved in the redemption of IMD.  Managing bunched   13withdrawal of liquidity of such a large size is expected to pose a big challenge for  monetary operations.  Box-III explains the measures taken proactively by the Reserve  Bank, which helped in limiting the  liquidity mismatch to a large extent.  Coupled with  the  high demand for credit (31.1 per cent growth year-on-year as on March 17, 2006) that  has emerged the liquidity situation has nevertheless changed radically relative to the  situation prevailing in most of 2005. The availability of LAF and MSS has enabled the RBI  to manage these changes in an orderly manner.    Chart-6: RBI's Liquidity Management  (Absorption + / Injection -) Through LAF and MSS 100000 LAF MSS 80000 60000 40000 20000 0 -20000 -40000 Date   Box-III: Liquidity Management During IMD Redemption  The India Millennium Deposits (IMDs) were foreign currency denominated deposits issued by  State Bank of India in 2000, on advice of the Government of India. It mobilised a sum of USD 5.5 billion  for a tenor of five years. IMD carried coupons of 8.50 per cent, 7.85 per cent and 6.85 per cent on US  dollar, Pound Sterling and Euro denominated deposits respectively. IMD subscription was limited to  non-resident Indians, persons of Indian origin and overseas corporate bodies. The interest income  earned on IMD was exempted from tax and there was provision of premature encashment after six  months only in non-repatriable Indian rupees. These IMDs matured on December 28-29, 2005 and the  large sums involved threw a challange for liquidity management.    Liquidity management in face of IMD redemptions was carried out to contain disequilibrium  while retaining monetary policy stance with a medium-term objective. Outflows on account of the  redemptions were met by smooth arrangements worked out in this regard. During December 27-29,  2005, RBI sold foreign exchange out of its foreign exchange reserves to State Bank of India (SBI)  totaling nearly US$ 7.1 billion, which in rupee equivalent terms was about Rs.32,000 crore. SBI on its  part had built up the necessary rupee resources to meet the obligations. Temporary tightness in  liquidity, was met by release of liquidity through repo window (including the second LAF) averaging  about Rs.23,000 crore per day in the last week of December coinciding with the IMD redemptions,  outflows due to advance tax payments and the continued surge in credit offtake. The second LAF  window made available since November 28, 2005 provided an additional opportunity to market  participants to fine tune their liquidity management. The smooth redemption of the IMD liability of this  size, bunched at a point of time, reflects the growing maturity of the financial markets and the strength  of the liquidity management system that has been put in place. Short-term money market rates eased  remarkably in the first week of January 2006 reflecting smooth redemptions of IMDs but again firmed up  in the second week reflecting pressures emanating from scheduled auctions of Government securities.   14 LAF / MSS (Rs. crore) 1-Mar-04 20-Apr-04 9-Jun-04 29-Jul-04 17-Sep-04 6-Nov-04 26-Dec-04 14-Feb-05 5-Apr-05 25-May-05 14-Jul-05 2-Sep-05 22-Oct-05 11-Dec-05 30-Jan-06 21-Mar-06The evidence of this efficient liquidity management may be seen in the relatively  orderly movement in both exchange rates and interest rates.  During times of excess  visible liquidity, the call rates have essentially hugged the reverse repo rate, as might be  expected, whereas they are near or slightly higher than the repo rate in times of tighter  visible liquidity (Chart 5).    Preparing the Markets   An important element in coping with liquidity management has been smoothening  behaviour of the central bank and the communication strategy. In August 2004, the  headline inflation rate shot up to 8.7 per cent, partly on account of rising global oil prices  and partly due to resurgence in manufacturing inflation. The turning of the interest rate  cycle looked imminent. The issue was addressed through burden sharing by appropriate  monetary and fiscal coordination and by preparing markets for a possible interest rate  reversal. In measured and calibrated steps the monetary policy stance was changed and  measures such as those on CRR and reverse repo were taken in a phased manner. Also,  banks were allowed to transfer HFT (Held for Trading) and AFS (Available for Sale)  securities to HTM (Held to Maturity) category, thereby affording them some cushion  against the possible interest rate shock. Markets were prepared with a careful  communication on the stance of the monetary policy by explaining that the central bank  would strive for provision of appropriate liquidity and would place equal emphasis on  price stability. It would consider measures in a calibrated manner. Monetary management  succeeded in building credibility and keeping inflation expectations low. Headline inflation  receded with the year ending with 5.1 per cent inflation. Inflation again surged temporarily  early this year, but has been kept under leash even while the central bank moved to mop  up excess liquidity. Markets were again told in October 2005 that the central bank is  prepared to take measures in calibrated and prompt manner and while genuine credit  needs would be ensured, emphasis would be on price stability. Policy communications  have been backed by credible actions in accordance with stance to keep inflation in tight  leash.     In the more recent period, the IMD redemptions were carried out successfully with  temporary volatility in money markets accompanied by liquidity shortages during  December 2005. However, monetary policy operations were carried out to contain  disequilibrium in line with the monetary policy stance with a medium-term objective. At the  same time necessary liquidity has been provided in recent months to address the tighter  liquidity due to frictional factors.  It may be added that the Reserve Bank has enough  instruments to manage liquidity.    Lessons from the Indian Experience & Coping Ahead   What has been the lesson from the Indian experience of coping with liquidity  management under large and volatile capital flows?    15First, by putting reforms on a more stable footing by adopting gradualism but  avoiding reversals, it has been able to sustain capital inflows on a more stable basis with  lower volatility than has been seen in some other emerging markets. This has helped  central banks in smoothening out interest rates under cyclical transition.   Second, in cases where money and debt markets have depth, development of  open market operations through repo operations is particularly important for building up  microeconomic capacities for macroeconomic objective of liquidity management. In India,  the emergence of LAF was a single biggest factor which helped to manage liquidity  amidst large and volatile capital flows and to keep short-term interest rates stable in this  environment. It widened the range of instruments for monetary policy and enabled the  Reserve Bank to operate on shorter range of interest rates. Restricting the maturities of  interest rates at which central bank operates to a smaller range at the short-end has  reinforced market functioning.  Third, in the face of constraints on sterilisation arising from paucity of instruments,  the monetary authorities in India adopted a careful strategy which preserved the strength  of the central bank balance sheet and the credibility of the central bank, while causing  minimal frictions in the debt markets. MSS was not contemplated of initially even while  capital flows had distinctly increased since 1993-94. However, in face of large surplus  liquidity since 2000, MSS was evolved as a very useful instrument of monetary policy to  sustain open market operations. MSS has marginal costs, but it has helped the monetary  authorities manage business and liquidity cycles through the surpluses and the deficits.  With MSS, the monetary authorities now have the option of assigning LAF for day-to-day  liquidity management, using MSS for addressing semi-durable liquidity mismatches, while  using outright sales/purchases of dated securities for truly long-term liquidity surpluses or  deficits. The MSS experience tells us that operating framework and procedures undergo  changes and one need to keep innovating to calibrate market operations to the evolving  liquidity conditions.   Fourth, by focusing on the microstructure of the markets and by facilitating  development of a wider range of instruments such as Collateralised Borrowing and  4 Lending Obligation (CBLO) , market repo, interest rate swaps, Certificates of Deposit  (CDs) and Commercial Papers (CPs), in a manner that avoided market segmentation  while meeting demand for various products, liquidity management could be placed on a  much firmer footing. Market and central bank practices evolved to institutional  developments. However, the payment and settlement system proved to be the most  difficult area, but one which delivered the enabling environment for micro and macro  developments supportive of the liquidity management procedures now in place. The focus                                                    4  CBLO is a money market instrument developed by Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) under RBI  regulations. The instrument is issued as a discounted instrument in electronic book entry form to enable  eligible market participants to undertake collateralised borrowing or lending from overnight to 90 days  maturity. It is in the nature of tripartite repo in which CCIL holds the underlying charge on securities. The  product was developed mainly for the non-banks, who were phased out from the uncollateralised call money  market during 2001-06. Currently, banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, primary  dealers, non-bank financial companies, Non-Government Provident Funds and some corporates are  participating in the CBLO market.     16on micro-aspects reinforced the central bank's ability to signal and transmit policy  changes.  Fifth, with efforts to build up indirect instruments for liquidity management, the  transmission of monetary policy has improved. The link between overnight interest rates  and yields on T-bills and liquid dated securities has become far stronger. While the  lending rates and even more so deposit rates have been taking considerable time to  adjust, the strength of the transmission has been in evidence in recent periods. It is  important to note that in a situation of large surplus liquidity, the transmission is  understandably weaker. However, in the more recent period as considerable amount of  excess liquidity was mopped up by the central bank, the rate signal efficacy has gone up  substantially.   Sixth, monetary policy setting through signalling improves, as the central bank's  liquidity management is able to establish its control over short-term interest rate by  reducing volatility in these rates. By removing working balance constraints for the banks,  it can influence the term structure of interest rates as reflected in money market rates of  various maturities and the sovereign yield curve.   Lastly, while temporary mismatches in liquidity conditions do pose a problem for  maintaining immediate goals of monetary operations, the overall objective of liquidity  management needs to accorded primacy. In India, in spite of difficulties posed by sudden  transitions in liquidity conditions, macroeconomic success of overall policies are reflected  in delivering low inflation, which at 4.7 per cent, has averaged below 5.0 per cent over  last five years in terms of the headline rate. Consumer price inflation has averaged still  lower at around 4.0 per cent on a point-to-point basis and 3.9 per cent on an average  basis.    In spite of the relative success in liquidity management in India, several  challenges remain ahead.   First, notwithstanding the large size of the debt markets, absence of a vibrant term  market, the illiquidity of a large set of securities and limitations of corporate debt market  continue to come in way of further contemplated changes.   Second, while the Reserve Bank now enables market participants to meet their  marginal liquidity demand twice a day on each working day, there is a moral hazard that  passive operations by central bank in the market may be resulting in some market players  not doing enough for their own liquidity management.   Third, as the system moves to maintenance of SLR securities at statutory  minimum levels, liquidity provision would become more difficult unless the instrument set  is widened to facilitate market players to even out their liquidity mismatches.   Fourth, as RBI withdraws from the primary market in accordance with the FRBM  Act, 2003, there is an urgent need to bridge the institutional gap with minimal necessary  changes so that market operations retain their efficiency, both from the view point of  central bank and the market participants.    17Finally, further improvements in liquidity management would substantially depend  on our abilities to improve forecasting of liquidity in the system. The short span within  which liquidity conditions have been changing by a large amount has been the biggest  constraint in targeting short-term interest rates. More effort for understanding the fiscal  position and the government cash balances, as also the timing of foreign capital flows are  of paramount importance in this context.
