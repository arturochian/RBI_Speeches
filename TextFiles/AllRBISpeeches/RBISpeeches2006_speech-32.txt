1India in Emerging AsiaFriendsI am honoured to be invited at the 12th International Conference on “The Future of Asia”organised by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (NIKKEI). The choice of the topic for the Session by theorganisers “India-The Rise of a New Economic Powerhouse” is indicative of the global confidencein India's economic performance and prospects for the future. However, as a central banker, Ineed to be conservative and modest in my approach to communication while retainingtransparency and credibility. I would therefore, approach the subject by drawing from the overalltheme of the Conference, namely, "The Future of Asia" and dwelling on India as part of theunfolding growth story of emerging Asia in the new millennium. In that context, some highlights ofIndia's recent economic performance would be in order. I will also be presenting Reserve Bank ofIndia's assessment on outlook and challenges for the Indian economy over the medium term. Ofsome interest to the audience may be a narration of some `not- easily-quantifiable’ sources ofstrength for the Indian economy. I will conclude with a mention of evolving Indo-Japaneseeconomic relations.India, Emerging Asia and the Global Economy2The emerging Asia accounts for around 45 per cent of world population and around 11per cent of world GDP, though in PPP terms the share of GDP is about 27 per cent. However, inrecent years, given the strong growth, the emerging Asia has contributed almost one-half of theglobal growth in GDP. In emerging Asia, the annual growth in GDP of 8.4 per cent and 8.3 percent during 2004 and 2005, respectively, was impressive considering that the growth in the worldeconomy during the corresponding period was 5.3 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively.According to the IMF, this growth momentum in Emerging Asia is expected to continue in 2006 aswell and real GDP in the region is projected to expand by 8.0 per cent, while the global growth isplaced at 4.8 per cent for the year 2006.Since the beginning of the new millennium, the strong performance of  emerging Asia,combined with the continued dynamism of the US has helped to sustain the current worldwideexpansion, offsetting sluggishness in Europe and also in Japan. Being the fastest growingeconomies of the world, over the past two years, China and India contributed 73 per cent to theAsian growth and 38 per cent to the world GDP growth (World Economic Outlook, IMF,September, 2005). If the recent recovery of economic activity in Japan gets strengthened, Japanis expected to be another engine of growth for the Asian  as well as the global economy.                                                1 th Address of  Dr. Y.V.Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 12 International Conference on “The Future of Asia”The Road to an “Asian Community” – Concepts and prospects, organised by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc (Nikkei) in Tokyoon May 25, 2006 (as circulated).2 As per the definition adopted by the IMF in the Regional Economic Outlook on Asia and Pacific (May 2006), EmergingAsia refers to China, India, Hong Kong SAR, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan Province of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, thePhilippines and Thailand.1Some observers prefer to describe the emerging economies of Asia asre-emerging economies to clarify that shift of wealth to Asia that is taking place is not anunprecedented situation, looking back into economic history, of course, by about three centuries.As per an OECD publication, in 1700, India's share in world GDP was 24.4 per cent, while China'sshare was 22.3 per cent. Asia as a whole (including Japan) accounted for 61.7 per cent in 1700,which fell to 59.2 per cent in 1820, and to a low of 18.5 per cent in 1950, before climbing to 37.2per cent by 1998 (Maddison Angus, "The World Economy: A Millennium Perspective", OECD,2001). The re-emergence in the second half of the 20th century was led by resurgence of Japan,succeeded by the miracle of East Asian economies, followed by China's outstanding success,and currently strengthened by Indian economy's impressive performance in terms of both growthand stability. According to the data published in the World Development Indicators of the WorldBank, India ranks fourth next only to the USA, China and Japan in terms of size of the economiesmeasured on the basis of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). It is interesting that in terms of PPP,three out of the four largest economies of the world are in Asia.In the recent years, the Asian economies are emerging as major trading partners of India.India's trade has grown faster with these countries than its overall trade growth. Emerging Asianeconomies accounted for a significant share of 22.4 per cent in India's total exports in 2004-05(16.0 per cent in 1999-2000) and 20.1 per cent of total Indian imports (16.2 per cent in 1999-2000). In 2004-05, China has emerged as the second major export destination for India after theUS and it has now become the largest source of imports for India, surpassing the US. Exports toChina surged by 81 per cent in 2004-05, while imports from China increased by 67 per centreflecting growing trade relations between the two countries. A similar trend was noticeable vis-à-vis the ASEAN-5 (Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines), but goingforward there is vast scope for further expansion in trade with these countries. In a way, theincreasing openness of the Indian economy to the external sector in recent years reflects itsexpanding economic relationships with rest of Asia. In recognition of the growing importance ofAsian countries in India's foreign trade, the series of nominal and real effective exchange rateindices released by the Reserve Bank have been revised to include Chinese Renminbi and HongKong dollar in the weighting scheme. Japan being already included, the representation of Asianeconomies has increased to three out of the total of six countries.Highlights of India's PerformanceIn November 2005, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, the widely admired former PrimethMinister of Singapore, said in the 37 Jawaharlal Memorial Lecture:“When I published the second volume of my memoirs in 2000, I wrote that India isa nation of unfulfilled greatness. Its potential has lain fallow under used”.“I am happy to now revise my view – Nehru’s view of India’s place in the worldand of India as a global player is within India’s grasp.”2While the change in India in the past five years seems dramatic, indeed, it is notdiscontinuous.  First, India as a nation has been diligently working over half a century to realizethe dreams at the time of its independence. Second, the domestic deregulation of 1980s andeconomic liberalisation of 1990s helped acceleration of growth. Third,  perhaps, the world isappreciating India and its progress better now than before.The three salient features in India’s economic performance over the period 1980-2000, asmentioned by several analysts, have been a high growth of output per capita, surpassed only byChina and East Asian countries; a very stable output per capita, surpassing that of even Chinaand East Asia; and the  growth is sourced by an increase in total factor productivity, therebyhaving positive  implications of an enduring nature of the process, rather than being driven only bybetter returns on capital.The Indian economy appears to be shifting to higher levels of growth trajectory in morerecent years with the average annual growth of real GDP increasing to 6.3 per cent during 1992-93 to 2005-06 from 5.8 per cent in the 1980s. Again, lately, the economy is perhaps picking up anaccelerated growth momentum, with an average  GDP growth at around 8 per cent per annumduring the last three years. It is equally notable that the inflation conditions have moderated toaround 5 per cent, decelerating significantly from relatively higher levels in the earlier periods.The strengthening of economic activity in the recent years has been supported bypersistent increase in gross domestic investment rates from 23.0 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to30.1 per cent in 2004-05 coupled with more efficient use of capital. Gross domestic saving ratehas also improved from 26.5 per cent to 29.1 per cent during the same period. The saving-investment balance in India is  in a desirable range thereby contributing to global stability also.            Facilitated by reforms, financial markets have become freer and institutions moreindependent operationally. Monetary policy has gained more operational autonomy withdiscontinuation of automatic monetization of deficits since 1997 and Reserve Bank's withdrawalfrom primary gilt auctions from this financial year, combined with increasing reliance on indirectinstruments. Money markets are orderly and stable with participants switching towards morecollateralised segments and rates varying generally within a corridor set by the policy stance.Government securities markets are now deep and vibrant with varied instruments catering tovaried investor perceptions. The foreign exchange market has acquired depth, while the capitalmarkets have become mature in trading procedures, risk management as well as payment andsettlement mechanism. India ranks as one of the three largest emerging markets in terms ofstock-market capitalization. There are over 9000 listed companies, out of which about 100companies have market values of more than US $1 billion each. Foreign investments span overmore than 1,000 Indian companies which is an impressive record. The banking sector has strengthened in recent years in terms of its conformance tosound prudential regulation and governance standards thereby minimising risks, strengtheningdisclosure and improving operational efficiency. Banks are migrating towards Basel II norms and3are taking steps for containment of impaired loans. There have been marked improvements in thehealth of financial intermediaries and competition and efficiency have also improved appreciably,while simultaneously adding to stability and resilience to shocks.Benefiting from a calibrated and sequenced strategy of liberalisation, India’s externalsector has become more resilient. While the current account after remaining in surplus for threeyears up to 2003-04 turned into a moderate and sustainable deficit in 2004-05, there was asignificant strengthening in the capital account resulting in continued accretion to the foreignexchange reserves. India’s foreign exchange reserves currently exceed its external debt, therebyreflecting improved solvency of the economy.The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided by the broad principles ofcareful monitoring and management of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or apre-announced target or a band, while allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions todetermine the exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way. The Reserve Bankintervenes in the foreign exchange market to contain volatility. Recent international research onviable exchange rate strategies in emerging markets has lent considerable support to theexchange rate policy followed by India.The engagement of Indian firms with the world has acquired new dimensions. Apart fromits leading edge in the software services, India is also becoming a major hub for manufacturingand export of manufactured products. The Indian information technology industry is becomingincreasingly global through cross-border acquisitions, on-shore contract wins and organic growthin other low-cost locations. This has been complemented by global majors continuing tosignificantly improve their off-shore delivery capabilities in India. Indian firms are also acquiringmanufacturing firms abroad to leverage comparative advantage of foreign locations, usingsynergies between the parent company and the company under acquisition and havingproduction facilities near the major markets also.Outlook and Challenges: A Central Bank PerspectiveThe Annual Policy Statement for the year 2006-07 released a month ago (April 18, 2006)provides the Reserve Bank of India's assessment of the outlook for the economy. The PolicyStatement notes that a number of downside risks loom over the global economy that haveimplications for the medium-term prospects of countries like India for which the channels of globalintegration are getting stronger over time. The key global risks for emerging economies arepotential escalation and volatility in international crude prices, a disorderly unwinding of themacroeconomic imbalances of the major economies and a hardening of international interestrates. Though characterised by significant downside risks, over the medium term, the prospectsfor the global economy are by and large positive.4For the Indian economy, the evolving economic and business environment exhibits anumber of encouraging signs that suggest reinforcement of the robust economic growthdemonstrated in recent years.First, increase in the gross domestic saving rate to levels around 30 per cent, coupledwith sustained absorption of external savings of about 2  per cent of GDP, would provide thepotential for attainment of an accelerated growth trajectory. Second, the micro structural reforms undertaken over the years have enabled continuingproductivity gains in the real sector.Third, the reform process involving widening and deepening of the financial sector, alongwith improved regulation and supervision, has also yielded encouraging results, as reflected in theproductivity measures relevant for the sector.Fourth, there is evidence of increasing business confidence as measured by variousbusiness expectation surveys and improvement in the investment climate. This is alsocorroborated by signs of enhanced levels of foreign direct investment.Fifth, the most progressive and dynamic of the Indian companies are manifestingincreasing levels of global presence through acquisitions and higher outward foreign directinvestment. The attainment of domain knowledge through such activities, along with best practicebusiness knowledge, and economies of scale in marketing may enhance the productivity growthof Indian business.Finally, it is noteworthy that Indian business has managed to exhibit impressive growthperformance in recent years in terms of most parameters despite the presence of significantconstraints posed by infrastructure. It has also displayed resilience in terms of the ability to copewith adverse developments such as oil price increases.Despite the positive factors for medium term outlook, there are some critical issues thatneed to be addressed for maintaining the current momentum of growth with stability.First, the poor state of the physical infrastructure, both in terms of quantity and quality,has been rightly receiving the focussed attention of the business class and the policy-makers.There are some reasons to expect a satisfactory outcome, provided the improvement inregulatory framework is sustained. The current investments are demand-led and therefore, arelikely to be completed with least gestation periods, coupled with a rapid payback on completion.Technological developments and rapid enhancement of domestic construction capabilities shouldaid the process of speedy and efficient implementation. Given the healthy fundamentals of thedomestic financial sector and the enhanced interest of foreign investors, funding should not poseany serious problem.Second, fiscal consolidation is taking place both at the Centre and States and there isgreater consensus now on the broad directions. The recent budget of the central governmentbrings the consolidation on track, targeting a gross fiscal deficit of three per cent of GDP by 2009while eliminating revenue (current) deficit. Our studies on State finances in Reserve Bank of India5give grounds for optimism in regard to their fiscal health. However, the issues of power subsidiesand ensuring quality in the delivery of services, especially with regard to education and health, doneed to be addressed.Third, and perhaps the most challenging issue relates to development of agriculture.While a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture, the GDP growth generated fromagriculture is only marginally above the rate of growth of the population, in contrast to the stronggrowth rates in the non-agricultural sectors, which is not adequate to address rapid povertyreduction. To facilitate a more rapid growth in agriculture, legislative, institutional and attitudinalchanges to supplement enhanced public and private investment may be needed. The ReserveBank, for its part, is redoubling its efforts in revitalising the rural cooperative credit system, instrengthening Regional Rural Banks, in providing incentives to commercial banks for promotinginvestments in rural economy and in ensuring adequate and timely delivery of credit atappropriate price. In fact, we are studying legislation and implementation of non-institutionalmoney lending, as it continues to be a significant source of credit for the farmers.Despite the Indian economy being poised towards a higher growth path, perceptibleimprovement is yet to be made on reducing unemployment. The unemployment rate, based onperiodical surveys increased in both rural and urban areas during the period 1994 to 2004. Thesharper increase of unemployment rates in the rural areas reflects a slowdown in agriculture. Apositive feature has, however, been a reduction in the poverty ratio from 36.0 per cent in 1993-94to 26.1 per cent in 1999-2000. The Government of India has set a target to bring down theproportion of people living below the  poverty line to 10 per cent by 2012, in line with the targetsunder the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by the United Nations.Not Easily Quantifiable StrengthsA distinguishing characteristic of recent global assessment of future of India has beengreater awareness and articulation of the strengths of India which are not easily quantifiable butare critical to the longer term prospects. I wish to draw your attention to some of the observations,in a summary form, without necessarily endorsing them.In the social context, attention has generally been given to the advantage of Indians’proficiency in written and spoken English language. However, this inherent strength should beviewed in the backdrop of the linguistic diversity of India which encourages people to learnseveral languages other than the mother tongue. (There are twenty two national languages as perthe Constitution of India.) The enhanced familiarity with multiple languages not only helps bringabout integration in the country, but also prepares them to adapt better to multi-cultural situations.To illustrate, a recent report in Financial Times (by Peter March dated May 17, 2006) titled “Feastof a Movable Workforce“ reads as follows: “In an anonymous office building in India, the J-Team is on a mission to strengthen linksbetween India and Japan. H.B. Jayanthi heads the 60-strong group of Indian engineerswho are working for Yojagawa, the Japanese industrial control systems market, in6Bangalore. They have been trained to speak – and even to think – in Japanese so theycan communicate effectively with colleagues in Japan while collaborating on productdevelopment“In this regard, it is also useful to recognise the importance of empowerment of women.Let me illustrate with some relevant facts in my home State, Andhra Pradesh.  There is aminimum allocation of one-third of admissions for women in medical colleges, but as of now,around half of the students are women. Of the 92,000 students admitted in engineering collegesthis year in Andhra Pradesh, over 30,000 were women. Similarly in the political arena, women arevery well represented. In the local bodies, there are about 250,000 elected officials ranging from amember of Gram Panchayats (village-level elected self-governments) to Mayors of MunicipalCorporations and Chairpersons of Zilla Parishads (district level elected councils) and of these,over 85,000 are women. These developments, which are shared in different ways by other States,give a positive twist to the outlook for empowerment of women for the future.Above all, the existence of a free press provides insurance against excesses and makesGovernments at all levels more accountable than otherwise. In this regard, it is interesting to notethat while 17 leading English newspapers have a combined circulation of 6.3 million andreadership of 17.9 million, 54 leading vernacular newspapers in India have a circulation of 21.4million and a readership of 197.2 million.The political climate is characterised by what may be termed as political system stability,despite the coalition cabinets and periodic elections both at the Centre and several States. It isremarkable that political cycles have not hindered the progress of well-calibrated economicreforms. As Michael Mandelbaum, a democracy expert at Johns Hopkins University inWashington said:“There’s a lot of turmoil on the surface of Indian democracy, but there’s a lot of consensusdeep down in the political system. “ In fact the political system should lend comfort to the global businesses in view ofelements of long-term predictability. Ambassador Yasukuki Enoki, Japanese Ambassador to Indiais reported to have said: “For the next two decades, Indian society is predictable and democratic framework ispredictable. “As regards macro-economy, there is an increasing consensus that India has crossed thethreshold of reform, leading the economy to become really market-oriented and price basedeconomy. This orientation has helped the country emerging as the major  service-outsourcinghub for the world. Moreover, acceleration in growth is expected to be sustained in view of theevolving pattern of domestic demand. For example, National Council of Applied EconomicResearch (NCAER) MISH data“clearly indicates that India is growing immensely wealthy. By the end of this decade, thestructure of the country’s demographics will change from an inverted pyramid, signifying a7small rich class and a very large low-income class, to a rudimentary diamond, where asignificant part of the low-income class moves up to become part of the middle class.“Further, there may be demographic bonus between 2010 and 2040 when India’s workingpopulation is still increasing while population in the rest of Asia may be levelling off or evendeclining. Moreover, public and private sector compete and co-exist in a dynamic balance whichis imparting competitive strength to the economy.Finally, in terms of business environment, the impressive growth coupled with marketorientation of the economy has been a bottoms-up exercise, with a very broad-based growingentrepreneurial class. The capacity to innovate is considered high and costs of innovation arereportedly low in India. For example, engineering-intensive service-led manufacturing is sought tobalance the advantages of standardised way of mass production of goods. Reportedly, there is anincreasing emphasis on service approach to manufacturing with adaptation of techniques such aslean production  to keep quality high and boost efficiency. These tendencies are perhapsreflective of a penchant for innovation among growing entrepreneurial class in India, imbued withprofessionalism and  seeking to be globally competitive.Evolving Indo-Japanese Economic RelationsFrom global and our perspective, Japan, as a leading industrial economy, has madesubstantial contributions to the growth of world trade over the years. Japan has also played a keyrole in the integration of developing countries, especially emerging Asia, with the world economyin terms of trade and investment. The developing economies have been the major destinationsand source of Japan's exports and imports, accounting for 58 per cent and 65.5 per cent ofJapan's total exports and imports, respectively, in 2004. Within developing economies, the shareof emerging Asia accounted for nearly 40 per cent of Japan's exports as well as imports.India and Japan share a cultural bond dating back to many centuries.  The two countries,in the recent times, have seen major improvement in the bilateral relations.  The visit of theJapanese Prime Minister Mr. Koizumi to India in April, 2005 marked a high point in this bilateralrelation.  The visit highlighted the fact that the spiritual affinities, enduring cultural contacts andhigh degree of commonality of political, economic and strategic interests provide great strength toIndia and Japan as partners in a globalising world.  An eight fold initiative to further strengthenthis partnership was enunciated as an outcome of this visit.  The intensity of high level contactswith Japan has continued since then and the Prime Ministers of the two countries have also meton the sidelines of the first East Asia Summit at Kuala Lumpur. The last one year has, therefore,seen intense engagement in our bilateral relations making Japan the focus of our policy in Asia.India and Japan have many complementarities in the economic sphere also.  Japan is arelatively labour scarce but capital abundant country whereas India has an abundance of anentire spectrum of human resources.  Similarly, India has a world acknowledged prowess in thesoftware sector and Japanese strength in the hardware sector is established for decades.  India8has a wealth of resources by way of raw-materials and minerals and Japan has the technologyand capital to produce knowledge intensive manufactured goods.  In short, if the two were toengage more intensively in terms of economic collaboration, the resulting synergies, theeconomies of scales and the complementarities could lead to great welfare gains for both thecountries. In recent times, Japanese Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have started to evince anincreasing interest in India and among the FIIs registered during the year 2004, a significantnumber belonged to Japan.  Japan has also launched “India Investment Fund” to mobilize fundsfrom Japanese investors to invest in Indian securities market.  According   to a survey on"Overseas Business Operations by Japanese Manufacturing Companies" (November 2004)carried out by JBIC, India emerged as the third most promising investment destination after Chinaand Thailand as against  5th in the similar survey in 2003 and 11th in 2000.Japan’s cooperation and participation in the accelerated economic development of Indiais deeply appreciated.  Japanese assistance has been particularly helpful in the physicalinfrastructure sectors of power, urban transportation, urban water supply and sanitation, watermanagement, seaports, tourism and also in the environment and forests sectors.  Japan has beenextending bilateral loans and grants assistance to India since 1958 and Japan is the largestbilateral official development assistance (ODA) partner of India.In sum, growing closer links between Japan and India augur well for a bright future forAsia and a strong voice for Asia in the global economy.Concluding RemarksLet me conclude by answering three important questions relating to public policy in India.First, what is the dominant objective of public policy? In Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s words:“The first and foremost priority is to finish the unfinished task which the founding fathersof our republic set out for us at the time of Independence: to get rid of chronic poverty,ignorance, and disease, which have afflicted millions and millions of our people. Greatprogress has been made. Particularly in the last 20 years, the Indian economy has donequite well.  ....... We need to underpin that growth by strong performance of ouragriculture, strong performance of our physical and our social infrastructure. These areour key priorities.“Second, what are the means by which the objective can be achieved? Put succinctly, theyencompass modernising the country’s infrastructure - physical, social and governance; creatingjobs and, attracting foreign investment for the purpose.Third, in this context, what is the appropriate message to global managers as they thinkabout India? Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s response to this question was:“India’s future lies in being an open society, an open polity, a functioning democracyrespecting all fundamental human freedoms, accepting the rule of law and, at the sametime, to emerge as a successful, internationally competitive economy.“Thank you.9
