Sourcing Reserve Bank of IndiaI have great pleasure in being with you today to share some thoughts relating to analysis ofeconomic policy, and I am thankful to respected journalist Shri Potturi Venkateswara Rao GaruIt is a memorable day for me to share the podium with our Chief Minister,        ChandrababuNaidu garu.  We have known each other closely for about two decades and have subsistingregard and affection for each other.  He has changed the mindset of the people towardsmodernity.  We are all proud of you, and your global reputation for professionalism andI am particularly honoured by the presence of my guru, Shri B.P.R. Vithal garu, as themoderator.The significant role of a free press in avoiding famines in post-independent India has beenhighlighted in the writings of Nobel Laureate Dr. Amartya Sen. It is necessary to extend thislogic and appreciate that a free press plays a critical role in the broader economic policy of thecountry (doubtless a free press now includes electronic media).  All our efforts to improve thequality of decision making in public bodies, including its accountability to the society at large,Such a press would also help expand information base for markets and enhance theirunderstanding of socio-economic   dynamics.  The  significance  of  an  objective,knowledgeable and enlightened press is important in a democratic environment irrespective ofthe relative roles of State or Government and markets in a mixed economy. Furthermore, therapid improvements in technology often demand not only on-line information but also instantI have deliberately chosen the subject of analysing economic policies for several reasons.  First,there is a wide spread interest now in the state of the economy and the economic policies,particularly in regard to financial markets and external sector, warranting an overview of howRBI’s data and studies help in the process.Second, such interest, which was earlier confined to Mumbai or New Delhi, is spreading to newThird, several economic dailies have recently strengthened their bureaus in Hyderabad and manyof them launched Hyderabad editions also.  The public interest and coverage of news relating tomoney, banking and financial markets have increased manifold in regional languages,The widening and deepening of interest in economic and financial markets with special referenceto the role of the central bank, though a somewhat recent phenomenon, is not unique to India. Infact, most central banks in the world especially in developed countries lay emphasis onappropriate communications policies.  The current situation can be illustrated with extracts froma recent news item relating to the European Central Bank (ECB) in the Financial Times of June27, 2000 on “ECB Defends Communications Policy” by Tony Barber.Communications Policyexemplified by “Eeenadu” and “Vartha”, in Andhra Pradesh.cities, one of the foremost of them being Hyderabad.analysis.require an enlightened, objective and critical press.excellence.Shri for giving me this opportunity.Friends,Analysing Economic Policy and Otmar Issing, the ECB’s chief economist, acknowledged that financial analysts, marketparticipants, academics, the media and the general public had a ‘rather mixed’ opinion of the“This indeed indicates a communications problem,” Mr. Issing said, adding that part of thetrouble lay in the excessive attention paid by the media and the public to the euro’s externalexchange rate”.“The verdict among most, if not all, of our ‘watchers’ seems to be that, broadly speaking, theECB has done a good job but has not been very effective in presenting and explaining itself," Mr.Issing told a conference in Frankfurt.  “Now to my mind at least, this situation is preferable to astate of affairs where the opposite was true – that is, if clearly mistaken policies had beenIt would be productive to draw some useful inferences from Mr.Issing's statement.First, effective articulation of policy by a Central Bank is important.Third, the perceptions of media are critical and concerns such as excessive attention by the mediaand the public to the exchange rate are not uncommon.  Against this backdrop, I would attemptto explain the communications policy of RBI by bringing on record the sources of informationAvailable evidence on international comparisons of level of transparency as well as quality andtimeliness of information clearly shows that RBI comes out well.   Professional standards andcredibility are ranked very high.  In fact, several of the speeches of Governor and DeputyGovernors of RBI are circulated to other central banks as part of the Bank for InternationalThe RBI makes efforts to provide quality data to the public at large, which emanates from arobust statistical system established and strengthened over the years.  The fundamental attributesof a good statistical system are credibility, timeliness and adequacy.

Broadly speaking, the sources of information from RBI would be ofconsiderable help analysis in money, banking, prices, credit, external sector, financial marketsand also to a certain extent fiscal and real sectors.  The financial markets include not only moneymarkets, government securities markets and forex markets but also to some extent corporate debtand equity markets.  The appropriate sources from RBI relevant to each of the policies areprovided in Annexure-II. care is needed in interpreting data released by RBI from time to time to ensuremeaningful analysis.  By way of illustrations, some specific items of wider public interest but       There are several aspects of trade data that need to be kept in view while assessing the statusof balance of payments, but two of them are of special significance.  First, much of the softwareexports are not included in the monthly trade data released by the Director General ofCommercial Intelligence, to the extent they do  not pass through the Customs.  Hence, there isoften an exaggeration of the trade deficit figure.  Second, import of gold in the recent years hasbeen through official channels because of liberalisation of gold imports.  So, any analysis thatinvolves  comparison with past data should capture these developments in order to assess thecurrent stability in the  balance of payments situation despite increases in  oil import bill  andgold imports.       The extent and nature of external debt is a matter of great interest to many observers.  Whilereporting analytically on external debt, it is useful to refer to the relevant ratios or conventionalindicators of creditworthiness also.       Third, the value of the debt itself, which is usu ally published both in US dollar terms andrupee terms, may fluctuate purely on account of valuation of foreign currencies other than U.S.Dollar with Dollar, and of rupee  U.S. Dollar, without any relationship with actualincrease or redemption of debt.       Fourth, the debt of a country may increase in a particular year because of extraordinary3circumstances, say a supply shock, but this may not necessarily signal an increasing trend.vis-à-visSecond, in considering the stock of debt, the maturity structure would also be relevant.External DebtBalance of Paymentswith potential for incorrect interpretations are explained here.

TheStatus and Advisorybroader context of creating public awareness, and obtaining continuous feedback.      The issue is not merely one of size of external debt, but the cost and terms of debt and thepurpose for which such debt is incurred, which may be assessed at macro or aggregate level andnot necessarily at micro level.  A careful look at the data for our country would show that thedecade of nineties' was characterised by a significantly qualitative improvement for the better as       Foreign exchange reserves of the country comprise foreign currency assets, gold and SDRs.The major portion of our total reserves is foreign currency assets, which the markets track       It is no longer sufficient to assess the adequacy of reserves in relation to the quantum ofmerchandise imports or the size of the current account deficit.  In view of the importance ofcapital flows, and associated volatility of such flows, it has become increasingly important totake into account the composition of capital flows, especially the element of portfolio flows andThe manner in which reserves are being built up is also critical.  This can be appreciated to someextent by comparing the increase in reserves with increase in debt.It will be interesting to observe that during the decade of the nineties, while we have added closeto $35 billion to our reserves, the increase in debt has been very negligible  implying that reserveThe figure of foreign currency assets released by RBI reflects the actual position net of alltransactions by RBI as well as variations in value of other currencies related to the US Dollar.Thus changes in the level of foreign exchange reserves in any week reflect a host of factors,including changes in valuation, sale and purchase by RBI, income to RBI, etc.       Analysts keenly observe changes in the level of reserves, but in doing so the temptation is tofocus on the marginal changes, and that too asymmetrically between increases and decreases.Furthermore, when reserves are built up, especially for evening out temporary mismatches insupply and demand, they are often meant to be prudently utilised. Indeed, equal care andattention are needed, in managing and assessing both accretion to and depletion of forex       Currently, a great deal of popular attention is being paid to issues relating to inflation and itsmeasurement in India.  As you are aware, there are two common measures of inflation – theWholesale Price Index (WPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Of this, the WPI is theheadline measure that is most often used and is released weekly. Contemporary inflation data is reading and interpreting inflation data, it should be borne in mind that indices havedifferent baskets with different weights to cover different sets of consumers or locations and arereleased at different points in time.  Data on inflation can be calculated using different timepoints and methods.  It can be measured on the basis of point-to-point or average changes.  The all, the changes can also be measured between provisional or final data.  Whendifferences between provisional and final happen to be large, special effort is needed to interpretthe data.       Furthermore, in analysing inflation, which basically refers to the rate of increase in prices,the explanatory factors of the changes are important.  The changes might have occurred because4       Abovechanges can be over a week, over the financial year or a year-on-year basis.

Banks announce what is called a prime lending rate(PLR), which is the rate at which the bank concerned lends to top quality borrowers.  They add aspread over PLR for other borrowers.  Banks also announce different PLRs depending on thematurity of the loan.  Further, unlike in the past when corporates depended mainly on advancesfrom banks, corporates can access banks' funds through Commercial Paper (CP) or bonds atmarket related rates.       RBI influences interest rate environment through a variety of instruments and, emphasis ison flexibility and avoiding volatility.  Furthermore, given the growing linkages betweendomestic and international markets, interest rate policy in India may have to consider givingincreasing attention to changes in inflation and interest rates in major international financial the past, credit to commercial sector meant virtually bank credit, in particular non-foodcredit from banks.  With progressive reforms in the financial sector, the sources of credit frombanks to commercial sector have widened.  It is no longer confined to non-food credit fromcommercial banks.  It includes investment by banks in non-SLR securities, which includesCommercial Paper, corporate bonds and debentures, investment in preference shares ofcorporates, investment in equity and bills discounted by financial institutions.  This data is now       There is still a wider concept of credit to the corporate sector by the banking system.  Thiswould include banks' investments in instruments issued by financial institutions and mutual it may be more relevant to see the extent of credit that has been made available bythe domestic financial system to the corporate sector on the whole, which would include thedisbursals made by financial institutions such as IDBI and ICICI. one finds criticism regarding reduction in the credit-deposit ratios.  Beforearriving at any conclusions, the coverage of credit as described above, ought to be looked into.At a broader level, resources raised by corporate sector directly from domestic and internationalcapital markets are becoming significant.        The basis of much of the happening in this market is the Government Budget, which givesthe market borrowing programme figure at the beginning of the year.  The number of times theRBI hits the market, the maturities of loans, the timing of issuance, the notified amount, the typeof issuance, the amount of underwriting accepted from Primary Dealers, etc. will depend on anumber of factors such as the size of total market borrowing programme for the year, the Waysand Means Advances position, the maturities of past loans, prevailing market conditions, etc.The volumes and bidding pattern  in auctions are also influenced by factors such as the stance ofmonetary policy, the prevailing interest rates, the liquidity conditions, etc. analysts' point of view, the Government securities market is very critical in ourcountry for several reasons, the most important being that it is a significant determining factor in5       FromGovernment Securities Market       Frequently,       Finally,funds.being made available in the Weekly Statistical Supplement of the RBI.

The RBI auction results are available immediately after auctions and the daily pressreleases of RBI give comprehensive data on money markets.  Many a time, RBI gives importantsignals and these signals cannot be interpreted in isolation, but need to be seen in tandem withother developments in the money market or developments in other markets, viz., forex markets particular interest to both RBI and analysts is the recently introduced LiquidityAdjustment Facility (LAF).  It appears essential to devote some attention to the features and theLiquidity Adjustment Facility announced by Governor Jalan in the last Monetary Policy Statement, the LAF wasintroduced on June 5, 2000.  The scheme is being implemented in phases to ensure smoothtransition and keeping pace with technological upgradation.  In the first stage of LAF, theReserve Bank is conducting a set of repo auctions for absorption of liquidity and reverse repoauctions for injection of liquidity in which Banks and Primary Dealers  (PDs) participate. The       The LAF serves three objectives.  First, the RBI has greater flexibility in determining bothquantum of adjustment as well as the rates by responding to the needs of the system on a dailybasis.  Second, the RBI can attempt to ensure  that the funds made available through this systemwould meet primarily the day-to-day liquidity mismatches.  Third, the short-term money marketrates should generally move within a corridor set by the repo and reverse repo rates,  impartinggreater stability in the market.       It may be useful to share with you the processes and the considerations that currently go into, consisting ofthe operational Departmental Heads, which meets each day in the morning to assess marketconditions, is responsible for decisions relating to LAF.  The Committee meets again at 12.00Noon  to assess the bids received under the LAF.  The exact quantum of liquidity to be absorbedor injected and the accompanying repos/reverse repo rates are determined by the Committee aftertaking into consideration, the liquidity conditions in the market, the interest rate situation and thestance of policy.  This depends on several factors including net inflows and outflows on accountof forex operations, current account balances of banks against  cash reserve ratio requirements,6The Financial Markets Committee determining the amount and the rate in the LAF. whole process, which is a daily event is completed within a couple of hours.

The LAF has been in operation for over a month now and the experience may be summed upthrough a few generalisations.  First, during this period, we have received bids from marketparticipants both for repos and reverse repos.  Secondly, banks and PDs have been bidding moreaggressively for reverse repos, both in terms of amount and rates.  Thirdly, there has also been atendency to put in multiple bids, which is normal in any auction.  Fourthly, sometimes bids havebeen received for both repos and reverse repos on the same day  and at times from  the sameparticipants.  Fifthly, for several days the Reserve Bank has not accepted any bids for reposunder LAF.  Sixthly, there has been an occasion when no bid was received either for repo orreverse repo. Seventhly, on most occasions, taking into consideration the needs of the market, theReserve Bank of India has been infusing liquidity, varying the rates flexibly.  Eighthly, therehave been occasions when the Reserve Bank has rejected both repo and reverse repo bids.Ninthly, the closing call money rates on days of tighter liquidity conditions seem to haveexceeded the rate at which Reserve Bank infused liquidity through reverse repos.       There have been a variety of reactions on the operations of the scheme.  For example, somelending banks claim that the scheme is biased against them while the PDs feel that the LAF hascreated more volatility rather than ensuring stability in the money market.  It has also been heldthat the LAF has resulted in increase in call money rates since market participants tend to bidhigher in order to be assured of funds.  Let me highlight some of the concerns expressed in the       First, there is a view among banks that the LAF is heavily loaded against lending banks.This argument is based on an erroneous impression that the Reserve Bank is ready to provideunlimited liquidity through reverse repo auctions.  The Reserve Bank's concern while assessingthe bids is not with bank-wise requirement of liquidity but a view on the liquidity of the systemas a whole.  All the bids for liquidity in a particular reverse repo auction may be rejected, if theRBI is of the view that liquidity in the system is adequate.  The RBI can monitor bank-wiserequirements on a continuous basis through an analysis of bids and thus identify chronicborrowers who are trying to fund more permanent asset positions with LAF rather than use it to      Second, a view has also been expressed that there are no counterparty limits on borrowingsunder LAF.  There is a limit since the extent of borrowings from the RBI will depend on the it is argued that since the auction for LAF is held on a uniform price basis  therebyeliminating the winners curse, there is a tendency among borrowers to submit bids in auctions athigher rates to ensure success and that ultimately, this increases the cut-off rate.  A case is,therefore, made for switching over to discriminatory price auction.  Since LAF attempts toprovide/absorb liquidity, though reflected through individual bids, uniform price auction couldbe preferred for an efficient post-auction market.  Furthermore, the rate fixed by the RBI, in away, becomes a benchmark for the market, which is sometimes considered to be moretransparent through uniform price auction, where the cut-off is a single clearing rate.  As againstthis view, it is argued that a weighted average rate can emerge from a discriminatory priceauction, which can serve as benchmark, and  yet serve the purpose of fine-tuning the bids.  There7       Third,holding of eligible securities in excess of SLR by market participants.fund mismatches.media and explain our understanding and perceptions in regard to each of them.The rate of interest will, however, depend on the quotes that are received in the bids.is no settled wisdom, even internationally, as to the ideal system of auction.  RBI will review the       Fourth, there is also apprehension that the Reserve Bank disapproves of multiple bidding.Let me clarify that multiple bidding is a common feature of any auction process and the media       Fifth, some PDs are of the view that the LAF has resulted in increasing interest rates in themarket as call rates tend to follow the LAF reverse repo cut-off rate.  It is inevitable that the cut-off rates in LAF have an impact on the call money rates since the market reads from the actionsof the Reserve Bank.  As stated in the Monetary Policy of April 2000, when the full-fledged LAFis in operation, the Reserve Bank will be in a position to manage the liquidity better andinfluence the short-term interest rates in line with the overall monetary policy stance. Let me inthe interregnum clarify that while the LAF is going through the early Protean stages ofdevelopment, the ultimate objective is for the RBI to develop an effective and efficient lender of PDs have urged that they should be given assured liquidity at a reasonable rate andthat the high cut-off rates for reverse repo in LAF have not only increased the carrying costs butalso transmitted to the bond market through increase in yields.  Furthermore, there is a concernthat availability of funds from the Reserve Bank is not even certain, as there is a risk of all bidsbeing rejected.  It must be realised that PDs have assured Level I support from the Reserve Bankat Bank Rate.  LAF currently operates only at the margin in replacement of Level II finance.  Thebasic objective of switching over to LAF is for the RBI to have greater influence over theliquidity and interest rate in the system. In viewing the impact of the reverse repo rate in LAF,the weighted average cost of borrowing of PDs would have greater relevance.  As far asproviding liquidity, the RBI is concerned with the overall liquidity in the market rather than the       Seventh, a related proposal has been to introduce a second LAF auction exclusively for PDs.Holding a second auction  for PDs well before the close of call money market  is asuggestion that is under consideration. In this light, one option being advocated is to hold asecond auction for  PDs, where the PDs would once again bid for liquidity even if it were atminimum prescribed mark-up, say varying in the range of 1 to 3 per cent over the cut-off ratefixed in the first LAF auction.  Responses to the suggestion would be welcome and would helpRBI take decisions to meet temporary problems. No doubt, during the next one year, RBI is       It is just about a month since the first phase of the LAF has been introduced.  We are all onthe learning curve.  The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring developments.   We have alreadyheld  very useful meetings with Primary Dealers Association and Fixed Income Money Marketand Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDAI) to obtain their  feedback.    A seminar on LAFis being proposed in August 2000 and we are happy to share experiences with reference to theory       Let me assure you that RBI intends to be flexible on the operating procedures and fine tunethe policy as well as the pace of implementation as we go along together with marketparticipants, but, the ultimate objective is to move to an efficient full fledged LAF, involvingmultiple auction on the same day, replacing traditional assured sources of liquidity from RBI atfixed interest rates.8and practice.confident of reaching the full-fledged LAF with multiple auctions, based on electronic dealing.exclusivelyneeds of individual market players.

In this background, RBI’scommunications policy may thus be described not only as transparent and timely but also a two-way process. The RBI recognises that sometimes its policies consciously create discomfort formarket participants, and naturally resentment of certain policies get voiced in the media.

It contains a brief account and assessment of the Indian economy bythe Reserve Bank and then delineates the policy for the next six months or one year asconsidered necessary. The significance of the statement is that the rationale for eachinitiative/announcement is clearly discussed to dispel any misgivings. In the current year, asupplement to the Statement was also issued. The Supplement gives a detailed and analyticalaccount of the current economic situation and serves to provide an appropriate backdrop to thepolicy Statement.

Italso includes the results of some of the studies and investigations made by the Bank, and inparticular, by the Department of Economic Analysis and Policy and the Department of StatisticalAnalysis and Computer Services. The contents cover articles on current economic issues, noteson current economic developments in India and other developments relating to credit control andexchange control measures adopted by the Bank. The Bulletin publishes analytical articles basedon data collected by the Reserve Bank often specifically for the purpose. It carries Speeches  ofthe Governor, Deputy Governors and Executive Directors. These speeches reflect the currentthinking of the policy makers in the Reserve Bank. The speeches generally indicate the directionof the policy in the current economic environment. The Bulletin has a statistical section, whichpresents current and up-to-date statistics on monetary, financial, external, banking and othereconomic sectors.  Some of these statistics, which are available on a weekly basis, are alsopublished in the Weekly Statistical Supplement to the RBI Bulletin : The supplement to the RBI Bulletin,which is a weekly publication provides information on important monetary, banking, and pricedata on a weekly basis. The Supplement also presents the weekly balance sheet of the ReserveBank and other developments relating to financial and bullion markets.

It is the statement of the Boardof Directors on the state of the economy, and on the balance sheet of the Reserve Bank. It alsopresents an assessment and prospects of the Indian economy.  An important development in theAnnual Report in the recent past is the inclusion of Box Items. These are well-researchedtheoretical and analytical write-ups on the important contemporary economic events and areReport on Trend and Progress of Banking in India: The Report on Trend and Progress ofBanking in India, which is issued in terms of Section 36(2) of the Banking Regulation Act,reviews the progress of banking and major developments in the field of banking policy duringthe year ending June.

TheReserve Bank appreciated the desirability of maintaining statistical continuity and on persistentdemand from the Researchers decided to continue to publish an annual review based generallyon the frame-work of the previous Currency Reports. The first Report covered the two financialyears 1935-36 and 1936-37 but since then has been published annually. Thus, the Report onCurrency and Finance till 1997-98 continued in a somewhat extended form of the currencyreports published by the Controller of the Currency prior to the establishment of the ReserveBank. The publication was largely descriptive and was intended to serve as an authentic sourceof reference for all those with research interest in economic and financial developments in thecountry. Effective 1974-75, the Report was published in two volumes, viz., Volume I coveringThe Report on Currency and Finance, in 1998-99 was transformed from the descriptive annualreview to a thematic and analytical document. The first such Report published in a single volumein 1999 focussed on the Structural Transformation of the Indian Economy whereby the analysisis based on time trend since 1980. The statistical statements are now consolidated in theHandbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy since 1999. The Handbook has been releasedannually since 1998 with an explicit objective of providing researchers time series data onimportant economic variables, especially those on monetary, financial and external sector.Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India: The Statistical Tables relating to Banks in Indiaan annual publication, contains comprehensive data relating to the commercial banking sector(including Regional Rural Banks). It covers balance sheet information as well as performanceindicators of each commercial bank in India. The data are presented bank group-wise and state-wise. The publication is divided into three parts, viz., summary tables, detailed tables and theappendix. The summary tables give position in respect of select items of liabilities and assets ofthe different classes of banks and other aspects of their working while the detailed tables givesimilar particulars for the individuals banks.   The appendix furnishes a complete list ofBanking Statistics : Banking Statistics , an annual publication, contains extensive data on thebusiness of the scheduled commercial banks based on the data on deposits and advancescollected under the Basic Statistical Returns System as well as summary tables depictingprogress of commercial banking based on sources other than Basic Statistical Returns.

To meet the evolving circumstances that determinewhat constitutes money and the attendant complexities in measurement two working groups inthe year 1961 and again in the year 1977 were constituted, and their recommendations actedupon. In continuation of the same tradition, and to further refine and broaden the money stockmeasures, the third Working Group was set up in December 1997. The Report submitted on June23, 1998 examines the analytical aspects of monetary survey in the light of the changingdimensions of the financial sector consequent to the implementation of financial sector reformsin India. The Report makes a number of suggestions to strengthen the statistical system in orderto enlarge the coverage of financial statistics beyond the traditional confines of the bankingsector. Accordingly, the Report proposes compilation of comprehensive analytical surveys of theReserve Bank of India, commercial and co-operative banks and the organised financial sector atregular intervals. The Report proposes compilation of four monetary aggregates, three liquidityaggregates and comprehensive measures of credit aggregates to effectively capture the dynamicsof the monetary and financial system. The conceptual framework of the Report is in consonancewith various country practices. The article, New Monetary Aggregates: An Introduction , waspublished in the October 1999 issue of the Bulletin and since then data dissemination for the newThe monetary data on the Reserve Money and the Balance Sheet of the Reserve Bank of Indiaare  available, on a weekly basis, in the Weekly Statistical Supplement (WSS). The data onmoney stock measures are  also available on a  fortnightly basis in the WSS. In the monthlyBulletin, details of various money stock measures, sources and components of Reserve Moneyand the Balance Sheet of the Reserve Bank are published.  In the annual publications, monetarydevelopments are analytically discussed over the year. The Handbook of Statistics on IndianA large number of studies under the aegis of the Development Research Group have beenundertaken in the Bank on the monetary and credit policy. Some of the more recent andimportant studies are – Monetary Policy, Inflation and Activity in India (April, 1992), Changing Monetary Process in the Indian Economy (September, 1992 ), An Approach toMonetary Targeting in India (October, 1994), Money Demand Stability: Myth or Reality – AnEconometric Analysis (July, 1996). Similarly, in the RBI Occasional Papers, a large number ofanalytical research has focussed on the monetary issues, especially issues relating to money andprices.

In April 1999, to begin with, an Interim LiquidityAdjustment Facility (ILAF) was introduced to serve as a transitional measure for providingreasonable access to liquid funds at set rates of interest. ILAF provided a mechanism forinjection and absorption of liquidity available to banks and Primary Dealers to overcomemismatches in supply and demand from time to time. It has now been decided to implement afull-fledged LAF in stages and the scheme has already been announced in the Monetary andCredit Policy for 2000-2001. In the LAF, the quantum of adjustment and the rates would beflexible, responding immediately to the needs of the system. The funds made available by theRBI through this facility would primarily meet the day-to-day liquidity mismatches in the systemand not the normal financing requirements of eligible institutions. The LAF is expected to impartgreater stability to the short term interest rates and facilitate the emergence of a short-term rupeeBanking and Financial InstitutionsThe Reserve Bank of India occupies the apex position in the financial system with itssupervisory and regulatory power. It collects and collates the data regarding the commercialbanking sector. For co-operative banks, the data come partly from the NABARD, and are partlycollated by the RBI. For data on Regional Rural Banks, the source of data is the NABARD.Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) is the major source of data for the FinancialThe position of the assets and liabilities of the banking sector, the interest rates, accommodationprovided by the scheduled commercial banks to the commercial sector and Certificates ofDeposits issued by the commercial banks are published by the Reserve Bank on a weekly basisin the Weekly Statistical Supplement.

The Report on Trend and Progress of Bankingin India, as the name suggests, is primarily concerned with providing and analysing data on thebanking and financial institutions. Analyses of the contemporary issues of capital adequacy,profitability, risk management, management of NPAs of the banks, as well as amendments in theregulatory and legislative framework of the financial system form the core of this report. Theperformance of the credit co-operatives, regional rural banks, mutual funds, NBFCs are alsocovered in this report. It may be mentioned that in view of the rising recognition of theimportance of NBFCs, for the first time a Chapter is devoted to this aspect in the Report for1998-99.The data on banking is published in Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India and  Banking – annual and quarterly. The Reserve Bank has released a special publication, Banking 1972-95, presenting comprehensive information on deposits and credit of ScheduledCommercial Banks according to various characteristics.  The time-series data presented in thispublication have been culled out from the published volumes of Banking Statistics. It also givesinformation on employees of Scheduled Commercial Banks according to category. In theHandbook of Statistics on Indian Economy a number of statements on banking with time seriesdata are presented. Another special study Major Banking Aggregates 1950-51 to 1997-98 wasThe results of the biennial sample survey on Debits to Deposit Accounts with Scheduled conducted by the RBI are also regularly published in the Bulletin. The resultsof the annual survey of investments of Indian commercial banks are regularly published as anarticle in the Bulletin. The survey covers investments in Indian and foreign securities of allscheduled commercial banks. Another interesting article pertaining to NPA in the commercialbanks was published in the July 1999 issue of the Bulletin. Still another article which wouldinterest the financial journalists is Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision- AnAssessment of the Position in India , which is published in the December 1999 issue of themonthly Bulletin. In the article, major principles of effective bank supervision are discussed andassessment in the context of the Indian environment is provided. Micro-finance is beingpracticed as a tool to attack the poverty the world over. In the last two decades substantial workhas been done in developing and experimenting with different concepts and approaches to reachfinancial services to the poor. The summary and recommendations of the ‘Taskforce onsupportive policy and regulatory framework for micro-finance in India’ is presented in December1999 issue of the Bulletin. In the same issue of the Bulletin, a Summary of the ‘Report onThe discussion paper on Harmonising the Role and Operations of Development FinancialInstitutions and Banking was released in January 1999.

The two Reports of the Committees chaired by Shri M. Narasimham provide a road mapto be followed. In the RBI Bulletin of January 1999, Dr. Bimal Jalan. Governor, Reserve Bank ofIndia, in his speech titled, ‘Towards a more vibrant Banking System’, discussed about the issuespertaining to the corporate governance system of banks, risk management, banking regulationand supervision, transparency and accountability and public policies relating to moral hazards inbanking sector.In the RBI Occasional Papers, some research articles on banking have been published in therecent past. In December 1995, an article, ‘ Performance Variability of Public Sector Banks:Need for Strategic Planning ’, discussed about the paradigm shift in planning strategies on thepart of the banks to improve their performance. In the RBI Occasional Papers (1996), a papertitled, ‘ Structural Changes and Asset- Liability Mismatch of Scheduled Commercial Banks inIndia ’ empirically verifies that both public and private sector banks showed some systematicchanges in the balance sheet proportions during the four years of financial sector reformsbeginning with 1991. In respect of asset-liability mismatch, balance sheets of both public andprivate sector banks are marked with poor matching while foreign banks showed somesignificant change in hedging pattern. In another article, ‘ Profitability of Public Sector Banks: ADecomposition Model’ published in 1999 in the same journal, inter-bank variability of profitamong public sector banks during 1992-98 is investigated with the use of a sequentialdecomposition model for profitability analysis. The important findings are preference forinvestments over advances in bank portfolios and increased competition reflected in convergenceSeveral speeches were delivered on the subject, in view of the importance of the subject, and ofthese notable are: Indian Banking - Second Phase of Reforms - Agenda and Issues (November,1997); RBI and Banking Sector Reform (December, 1998); Towards a More Vibrant Banking (January, 1999); March to the New Millenium by Indian Banks (October, 1999); and Development –Which Way Now? (January, 2000); Agenda for Banking in the Millenium(March, 2000).The emphasis of the monetary policy on stabilising the prices underlines the need for an analysisof the long-term trend of the price level by the monetary authority. For analysing the pricesituation mainly the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are takeninto account. Although, data on WPI and CPI are compiled by the Ministry of Labour, Ministryof Industry, and the Central Statistical Organisation of the Government of India, the ReserveBank of India, keeping in view the importance of these data, disseminates them regularly throughvarious publications. Separate analyses are carried out for the primary articles group,manufacturing items, and for the fuel, power, light and lubricants group. The variations in the17price indices are presented on a point-to-point and on an average basis.PricesFinance Systemin bank-wise performance in the reform period in the reform period.While the Weekly Statistical Supplement disseminates data on the WPI on a weekly basis, theRBI Bulletin provides comprehensive monthly data on the same for various groups and sub-groups of items. The RBI Bulletin also publishes data on the CPI separately for industrialworkers, urban non-manual employees and for agricultural labourers. The Consumer Price Indexdata are presented for all-India as well as for selected centres. Data on bullion prices on weeklyand monthly basis are disseminated through the WSS and the RBI Bulletin, respectively. Thedata published in the Bulletin and in the WSS can be accessed by the public through the interneton the RBI website in the respective sections. Apart from the routine dissemination of data, deepanalytical insights on the price situation in the economy are available from RBI Annual Reports,Report on Currency and Finance and various studies undertaken by the Development ResearchGroup of the RBI. All these efforts have contributed towards a timely, adequate and accurateA number of important studies on this subject have been sponsored by RBI in the recent past –Dynamics of Inflation in India: A Neural Network Approach (DRG Study, April, 1998),Industrial Inflation in India during the Eighties: An Explanation (Occasional Papers, March1992), Core Inflation in India: Measurement and Policy Perspectives (Occasional Papers,Summer, 1999), Dynamics of Inflation in India and their Modeling by Time Series Analysis(Occasional Papers, June, 1994) and Recent Divergence between Wholesale and Consumerprices in India – A Statistical Exploration (Occasional papers, December, 1998). On the issue ofprice stability and inflation, a speech in the RBI Bulletin that deserves special mention is: (October, 1999)In addition to the research studies, important contemporary issues on money, banking and prices,have been discussed in the Box Items in the annual publications – Annual Report, Report onTrend and Progress of Banking in India and Report on Currency and Finance.  The objective ofproviding the Box Items, as discussed earlier, is to clarify the concepts and provide a theoreticalbackdrop to the economic developments.  It is in this context that the box items on Price, and Core Inflation (Annual Report, 1996-97), Monetary Conditions Index (AnnualReport, 1997-98), Transmission of Monetary Policy, Lags in Monetary Policy, and Interest RateTargeting (Annual Report, 1998-99), Credit Delivery System, and Changing Forms of BankCredit (Report on Currency and Finance, 1998-99), Factors Affecting Competitiveness andEfficiency in Banking, Virtual Banking, and Asset Liability Management (Report on Trend andAccommodation provided by the scheduled commercial banks to the commercial sectorconstitutes one of the sources of broad money and has implications for credit delivery or creditoff-take. Accommodation is provided by the scheduled commercial banks in various forms suchas food credit, non-food credit, investment in commercial paper, bonds/debentures/preferenceshares and equity shares issued by the public and private corporate sector units, and loans tocorporates against shares held by them. The Reserve Bank disseminates the relevant detailsthrough the WSS on a fortnightly basis.

Banks andFinancial Institutions have also been entrusted with providing credit on reasonable terms tocertain sectors, viz., agriculture, micro-credit institutions, small-scale industries and housing. TheReport on Trend and Progress of Banking in India focuses on these issues in detail and specificECBs are being permitted by the Government of India as a source of finance for Indiancorporates for expansion of existing capacity as well as for fresh investment. The  policygoverning the ECBs seeks to keep an annual ceiling on access to ECBs. External debt statisticsare disseminated semi-annually within five months of the reference period. While the datapertaining to the end-March are released by the RBI in the Annual Report, that relating toSeptember/December are disseminated by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in theInformation on balance of payments, exchange rate, external debt, and foreign exchange reserveunder external sector statistics is disseminated on a regular basis. While the Government of Indiaprovides significant information on external sector statistics through its Economic Survey, theReserve Bank has been entrusted with the primary responsibility of compiling and disseminatingdata on balance of payments, exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves. This core activity ofthe Bank has undergone significant changes in the recent past mainly due to the deepening of theliberalisation process, endeavours to adhere to or adopt the international best practice – both interms of concepts and definitions and the formats for presentations- unprecedented growth in theservices sector and renovations in the external debt statistics. This evolution of changes has beenfacilitated, to a large extent, by the revolution in the field of information technology (IT).In a world of many currencies with generalised floating, market participants need to exercisecaution in interpreting the direction and magnitude of a change in the nominal or real exchangerate of the local currency. In such circumstances,  market participants and analysts may seek tostudy exchange rate movements in terms of effective exchange rates , the word ‘effective’denoting ‘suitable averages’. In practice, two types of indices, viz., the nominal effectiveexchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) are generally beingconstructed.  The NEER is a weighted average of the bilateral nominal exchange rates of thehome currency against foreign currencies whereas the NEER adjusted for prices gives REER.The RBI’s reference rate is released daily in the website, while the information on the spotexchange rate, inter-bank forward premia and turnover in the foreign exchange markets aredisseminated through the WSS, and 5-country indices are published in the monthly RBI Bulletinwith a lag of less than one month. The 36-country indices are disseminated with a lag of twomonths. Further, while analysing the movements in NEER and REER, market participants needto keep in mind that these are indices and, therefore, need to be interpreted cautiously. Thedefinition, weighting scheme and the procedure underlying the construction of 5-country trade19based NEER and REER has been disseminated in the August 1998 issue of the RBI Bulletin.External SectorEconomic Survey.Box items address the subject matter analytically.India’s gross foreign exchange reserves comprise foreign currency assets of the Reserve Bank,gold held by the Reserve Bank and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of the Government of India.Reserve Position in the Fund is not included as part of foreign exchange reserves, although somecountries do include these balances as part of their reserves, as they may not be available onimmediate demand. Information on foreign exchange reserves is arrived from the actual book-entry as per the Reserve Bank records. These details, both in rupees and in US dollar, aredisseminated on weekly basis in WSS within a week of the reference date and then in themonthly Bulletins and in the annual publications. The Reserve Bank also regularly disseminatesthrough its monthly Bulletin, with a lag of about two months, details of outstanding balancesunder non-resident Indian deposit schemes, foreign investment inflows and sale/purchase of USdollar by the Reserve Bank. Forward liabilities of the Reserve Bank are identified separately anddisseminated in the RBI monthly Bulletin. The RBI website, however, carries this informationBalance of Payments (BoP) statistics systematically, records for a specific period, the economictransactions of an economy with the rest of the world i.e. transactions between residents and non-residents. Transactions under BoP consist of those involving goods, services and income (i.e.current account transactions) and financial claims on and liabilities to the rest of the world. (i.e.capital account transactions). In an attempt to facilitate inter-country comparison, concepts anddefinitions and the presentation format underlying the BoP statistics have generally beenmodified to reflect those recommended by the IMF in its BoP Manual (5 edition). To illustrate,earlier presentation of the capital account was in the sector-wise beneficiary specific format andthe revised format of the capital account is based on the type of capital inflows, enablingIn view of the need to reduce lag in the collection and publication of BoP data (both in rupeesand US dollars) concerted efforts were made and the lag is now reduced substantially with thedata released on quarterly basis within the next quarter. To illustrate, the data for Jan-Mar 2000was  available on the RBI Website before the end of June 2000 and will be available in print inthe July issue of the Bulletin. The data on international trade as released by the DirectorateGeneral of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI & S) are also disseminated through theIn the current account, two items that assumed importance in the recent past are -  softwareexports and gold imports. The software exports are classified broadly into two types, ., on-siteservices and off-site services. On-site development refers to the work being done at the client’ssite, while off-site exports could be in physical form (software prepared on magnetic tapes andpaper media) as well as in non-physical form. Software exports in non-physical form, in turn,relates to the direct transmission abroad through dedicated earth stations/satellite links which getcaptured in the ‘Softex Forms’ prescribed for the purpose by the Reserve Bank. Software exportsin the physical form are captured by the trade data compiled by the DGCI&S and are reportedunder merchandise exports in the BoP data, as per the international practice. Software exports inthe non-physical form are recorded as non-factor services under invisibles. For the purposes ofBoP, National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) also collects dataon software exports. And RBI considers the data set released by them. It has been observed that20the two sets of data are close to each other.vizmonthly and annual publications of the RBI.classification of various capital inflows into non-debt and debt creating flows.thnearly a week ahead  to meet with international standards.A few of the DRG studies having a bearing on the external sector are Portfolio Selection ofManagement of Foreign Exchange Reserves (June, 1999) and EMU, Euro and India (March,1998).Another crucial aspect concerning the BoP is that of Capital Account Convertibility (CAC). TheCommittee on Capital Account Convertibility, 1997 (Tarapore Committee) has laid down theroad map for attaining the convertibility on the capital account.  This Report contains, inter aliavarious indicative limits on various macro-economic variables. The financial journalists and themarket participants may use this information as a sort of background research material againstAnalysis of external debt statistics to study its sustainability needs to be made in the context ofother related issues such as levels of reserves, maturity pattern, share of the short-term debt, etc.Various international agencies like Bank for International Settlement (BIS) also disseminateinformation on external debt statistics and in the light of the conflicting magnitudes of externaldebt statistics disseminated by them, the Reserve Bank had also set up a Technical Group onExternal Debt, the Report of which is available with the Bank.  Further, in view of the growingsignificance of external debt, Reserve Bank has been associated with efforts aimed at holdinginternational conferences on external debt with the objective of providing a wider platform todiscuss various issues connected with external debt. The first conference was held in 1999 andSeveral of the speeches have tracked the policy-developments in external sector, and thenoteworthy among them are External Debt and Economic Reform (December, 1997) and (July, 1999).The Reserve Bank regularly, soon after the presentation of the Railway Budget and the UnionBudget, carries respective articles which are mainly descriptive and factual on ‘Finances ofGovernment of India’ and ‘Railway Budget’ in the monthly Bulletin.  Besides, a consolidatedstudy on Finances of State Governments is published annually by the Reserve Bank.  The maincharacteristic of all these articles on Government Finances is to analyse objectively the thrust ofthe fiscal policy and to highlight the main conclusions.  Further, in order to supplement theannual data/information, a summary table on ‘Union Government Accounts’ is also published inthe RBI Bulletin, which gives cumulative monthly financial position of Government of IndiaThe annual publications of the Reserve Bank especially the Annual Report and the Report onCurrency and Finance publish analytical reviews of the Government Finances – both Central andState separately and combined.  Further, the Handbook also includes detailed data onGovernment Finances in India. The ownership pattern of market borrowings of both the Centraland State Government and the maturity pattern of Central Government to market borrowings are21published annually.during the year, based on data released by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.Government FinancesExternal Debt Policies in Emerging Economies: New Dimensions the Bank has since released a volume containing the papers and proceedings of that conference.which evolution of indicators may be analysed.,As the Government of India regularly borrows from the market throughout the year, the auctionresults of treasury bills of various maturities and dated securities are released immediatelythrough the press release and the website.  These are also published in a consolidated manner inthe WSS, monthly Bulletin and the annual publications. The data on small savings, instrument-wise, on annual and monthly basis is published in the Bulletin. The details of the StateGovernment borrowings which are generally mobilised in two/three tranches and are mainly onpre-announced coupon rates are disseminated through the press release, website and the annualThe different concepts of deficit which have gained importance in government finances in Indiawere first introduced in the Annual Report (1989-90).  The focus on rising deficit and the needfor effective debt management was stressed by the Reserve Bank in its various publications.  Thearticle in the November 1996 issue of the Bulletin presents a detailed review of the internal debtmanagement policy and operations wherein the rationale for reforms in government finances andgovernment securities market.   The agreement signed by the RBI with the Government of Indiato delink automatic monetisation from the budget deficit has been discussed in the Box Item ofthe Report on Currency and Finance 1994-95. Further, since April 1, 1997, issuance of ad hocTreasury bills was discontinued and a system of Ways and Means Advances was introduced. TheIn addition to all these publications, to supplement the material on Government finances, RBIOccasional Papers and DRG Studies also publish analytical articles on Government Finances.For instance, a DRG study published in 1995 dealt with Fiscal Efficiency in the Indian and RBI Occasional Papers carried articles such as Dynamics of Interaction BetweenGovernment Deficit and Domestic Debt in India (September, 1989) Resource Gap of StateGovernments: Measurement and Analysis (December, 1994) and Fiscal Markmanship in India(September, 1990), and Sustainability of Central Government Debt (March, 1998). It issignificant to note that the first study which cautioned the Central Government on mountingdomestic debt and impending domestic debt trap was published in the Occasional Papers in June,1987.It may be of interest to note that the various issues relating to the proposed legislation on fiscalresponsibility, initiatives of RBI in regard to State Finance etc. are analysed in the speechespublished in RBI Bulletins. Among the noteworthy are State Finances and RBI Initiatives1998) and Legislation on Fiscal Responsibility and Reserve Bank’s Role: Some Issues (March,2000).State Finances - The Reserve Bank of India publishes an article on State Finances in the monthlyBulletin. This is published once in a year. In 1999-2000, the article was delinked from theBulletin and was published as a separate study. This study deals with the finances of the StateGovernments with reference mainly to the budgets and any other available supplementaryinformation along with the stance of respective State fiscal policies, policy initiatives, resourcemobilization and the proposed expenditure strategy. Also, the consolidated budgetary position ofthe State Governments as well as the emerging conclusions and perspectives in State finances aredelineated. In the said article, detailed information on finances of each State is presented.

The TechnicalCommittee to examine the issue of State Government Guarantees in all its aspects wasconstituted by the RBI in November 1997, to help formulate a policy on guarantees for eachState government within certain national parameter. The summary of the recommendations isIn this regard, a study on ‘ Resource Gap of the State Governments- Measurement and Analysispublished in  RBI Occasional Papers (December,1994) and a speech on ‘ State Finances and RBI money market consists of various sub-markets such as, call/notice market, treasury billmarket, repo market, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and Commercial Paper (CPs) market andcommercial bill market.
