Some Apparent Puzzles for Contemporary Monetary Policy*Rakesh MohanI. IntroductionI feel very honoured to have been invited to deliver this dinner address tothis distinguished audience.  We have had a long day of intensive discussionscentered on issues related to the Indian and Chinese economies.  I thought that,given the timing of this address and the fact that we have experts present hereon both the economies, it would be more advisable to talk about some generalissues that are engaging economic policy and monetary policy makers today allover the world.  This is perhaps safer since there are no clear answers andhence one is free to speculate!We are living through interesting times.  Oil prices have been rising at afast pace over the last two years.  The IMF, in September last year had used animplicit projection of oil prices at US$ 37.25 per barrel in 2004.  Now, however,the forecast for international crude prices - the biggest risk to global growth - hasbeen revised upwards by 20.5 per cent from the April 2005 projections and worldtrade growth projections has been cut by 50 basis points.  Unlike earlierexpectations, when this price rise was expected to be relatively temporary,international opinion now is that it is more permanent than temporary.  Yet, theIMF's September 2005 World Economic Outlook (WEO) has retained the globaloutput growth forecast at 4.3 per cent, a level higher than average world outputgrowth through the 1990s and until 2004, though it admits that risks are stillslanted to the downside.  In our own two countries there is, as yet, no sign of aslowdown: in fact, just earlier this week, we at the Reserve Bank of India, revisedour growth forecast for 2005-06 (i.e., April 2005-March 2006) for policy purposesfrom “around 7 per cent” in April 2005 to “7.0 per cent – 7.5 per cent” now.  Andwe are among the countries that are said to be more energy inefficient anddependent on oil imports.One also sees little impact of the current oil price episode on globalfinancial markets. Undisturbed by the somewhat slowing global growth scenario,financial markets have remained generally benign with low interest rates andhealthy stock markets.  Moreover, corporate balance sheets in most countrieshave been exhibiting continuous improvement with no pause in the determinedefforts observed towards restructuring and productivity promoting cost cuttingactivities.  This is certainly true in India and presumably in China as well.  In factthis financial strengthening of the real corporate sector is perhaps underpinningthe continued health of the financial system and is emerging as a cushionagainst medium term risks and uncertainties.  I am saying all this against thebackdrop of the difficulties that we all went through in the previous oil price shockepisodes of 1973-74, 1979-80 and 1989-90.Besides, the macroeconomic imbalances - a key risk to global growth -have actually increased with the current account deficit of the US poised to cross                                                          * Key Note Address by Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the ConferenceChina’s and India’s Changing Economic Structures: Domestic and Regional Implications,organized by the IMF, the China Society of Finance and Banking and the StanfordCenter for International Development in Beijing during October 27-28, 2005.

Yet financial conditions have enabled a smooth financingof these imbalances with growth and interest rate differentials continuing to fuelinvestors' appetite for the US.At the same time, the same favourable financial developments havecaused large imbalances to grow inwards, particularly in the form of householddebt and increases in housing prices and this is seen as heightening risks for thefuture. Low bond yields and flat yield curves have triggered an ever-wideningsearch for yields, aided by the compression of credit risk spreads. This has,perhaps, increased the risks embedded in the financial system and financialmarkets could become vulnerable to corrections. Questions regarding thesustainability of current global growth, overall credit quality and the state of thehousehold sector's finances have begun to arise. The same set of factors,however, have improved the access of emerging market economies to financialmarkets, with the low spreads of their bond yields enabling financing of stronggrowth with moderate inflation, strengthening of fiscal and balance of paymentspositions and the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves.Perhaps the greatest puzzle in current global developments is the co-existence of abundant liquidity and low consumer inflation, though there are nowsome incipient signs of oil price induced increases in most countries. Despite theprolonged period over which monetary policy all over the world has remainedaccommodative, inflation has been unusually benign, relatively impervious tosoaring crude prices and the elevated levels of prices of non-fuel commodities.This phenomenon is unique in recent history.These are not out-of-the-earth paradoxes and many explanations havebeen offered. Yet, taken together these stylised facts give an indication thatconventional wisdom often fails to explain them. It is in this context that I shallfocus on some of these apparent puzzles and their explanations in the presentlecture.  I am particularly concerned with possible erosion of the efficacy oftraditional price related policy measures, viz., the exchange rate and interest ratemechanisms in restoring macro economic balances.The rest of my address is organized as follows.  Section II presents somestylized facts, puzzling as they are in terms of the conventional understandingand wisdom.  This is followed by a discussion on the proximate explanations(section III). The last section has taken up an appraisal of the way ahead interms of possible policy responses keeping in view the shifting balance of risksand the muted pricing signals (section IV).II. Some Apparent PuzzlesFrom the various puzzles that the monetary policy makers routinely face,let me focus on six issues, viz., (1) the US dollar appreciating despite increasingUS twin deficits, (2) soaring oil prices accompanied by strong global growth, (3)long term bond yields falling in the presence of Fed Fund rate hikes, (4) lowconsumer inflation in the presence of abundant liquidity and increasing assetprices, (5) strong global growth accompanied by slowdown in global saving andinvestment rates and (6) the phenomenon of low inflation despite currencydepreciation.Increasing US Twin Deficits and the Appreciating US DollarOver the past two decades, the US has transformed itself from theworld’s largest creditor into the world’s largest debtor nation. At the end of 2004,its debt to the rest of the world exceeded its assets by about US $2.5 trillion, i.e.,21 per cent of its GDP. Driving this massive mismatch is the quantum jump inthe current account deficit during 2000-04 from the level during 1995-1999,largely resulting from the mounting fiscal deficit and falling private savings. TheUS macro imbalances are set to accentuate following the disaster brought uponby Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The IMF’s September 2005 World EconomicOutlook projects the U.S. current account deficit to rise to over 6 per cent of GDPin 2005, driven by higher oil prices and strong domestic demand (Table 1).Table 1: US Twin Deficits, NEER and REERCurrent Account General Government NEER REERBalance/ GDP Fiscal Balance/ GDP (2000=100) (2000=100)(Per cent per (Per cent per annum)annum)1990-1994 -1.00 -4.88 85.80 87.801995-1999 -2.06 -1.24 89.78 86.332000-2004 -4.63 -2.39 97.13 98.092005 > -6.0 # -3.7 # 83.13* 87.73*# : WEO’s Projection; *: Pertains to August 2005.Source: World Economic Outlook, IMF; International Financial Statistics, IMF and WorldDevelopment Indicators On-line, World Bank.What is the solution to these persistent and mounting imbalances?Conventional wisdom would suggest that the existence of these twin deficits andlittle expectations of improvement at present would have led to a market ledsizeable adjustment of the US dollar against other major currencies. The USdollar, which did encounter depreciation in terms of NEER in the first half of1990s, appreciated in the second half of 1990s and even in terms of REERduring 2000-04. The process has also continued during the first eight months of2005 despite the sustained rise in the U.S. current account deficit, offsetprimarily by a depreciation of the euro, pound sterling and yen. The weakeningof the euro against the US dollar in recent months possibly reflects theincreasingly unfavorable short-term interest rate differentials and growingpolitical uncertainties in Europe following the rejection of the European Union’sconstitution in France and the Netherlands, and post-election problems inGermany. Except in the ASEAN-4, the trade-weighted exchange rates of the UShave generally appreciated in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America.Following the Chinese exchange rate reform on July 21, 2005 — including a 2.1per cent revaluation, the adoption of a reference basket of currencies, and a 0.3per cent daily fluctuation range against the U.S. dollar — the renminbi hasremained broadly unchanged against the U.S. dollar. Clearly, the steady/appreciating US dollar despite the rising current account deficit constitutes adaunting paradox of the day.Strong Global Growth despite Soaring Oil PricesAfter the oil shocks of the 1970s, the first half of the 1990s witnesseddeflationary pressures in terms of real oil prices. However, the lull in oil pricesturned out to be short-lived. Soaring oil prices have since characterized theperiod 2000-2004 when the WTI prices increased sharply from the level in thesecond half of the 1990s. While the IMF’s real oil price index at 277 in 2005 sofar remains below the peak of 452 witnessed in 1980, oil prices are scaling newheights every day driven mainly by growing or unchanged demand, lowinventories, lack of spare capacity, and geo political tensions and uncertainties.While the accommodating global monetary conditions have placed oil futures inthe class of sought-after financial assets, the persisting high levels of oil pricesincreasingly indicate that a large part of the oil price hike has attained apermanent character (Table 2).Table 2: Global Growth, Business Confidence,Corporate Profit Growth and Oil Prices InflationWorld Growth in World US US WTI Oil PricesGrowth Trade Volume Business Corporate (US $ per barrel)(per (goods & Confidence Profitcent services) Index Growthper (per cent per (per cent perannum) annum) annum)1990-1994 2.62 5.57 -- 7.15 20.44 (-1.86)1995-1999 3.69 7.46 54.63^ 7.57 18.95 (4.67)2000-2004 3.84 6.34 60.50^ 6.88 30.97 (19.36)2000 4.71 12.44 51.66 -3.91 30.32 (58.17)2001 2.44 0.08 43.91 -6.19 25.87 (-14.67)2002 2.95 3.41 52.37 15.49 26.12 (0.95)2003 3.97 5.44 53.31 16.42 31.10 (19.07)2004 5.13 10.33 60.50 12.57 41.45 (33.29)2005 4.30 P 7.00 P 54.45* 16.00# 56.01 (35.14) PP: WEO’s projection for 2005 over 2004; *: August 2005; Figures in bracket are annual percentagechanges; #: 2005 Q2 YoY; ^: pertains to the year 1999 and 2004 respectively.Note: The overall US Business Confidence index, referred to as the US Business ConditionsIndex, ranges between 0 and 100.

Yet, global growth remains remarkably on track. Indeed,the growth momentum has only improved from the second half of the 1990s tothe first half of this decade. The growth in world trade volume (goods andservices) has also recovered after some slowdown in 2001 and 2002. TheSeptember WEO has, thus, retained its April estimate for 2005 global growth at4.30 per cent. What is all the more surprising is the increasing businessconfidence (e.g., in the US) coupled with high corporate profit growth during2002-05, much higher than in the roaring 1990s.Falling Long Term Bond Yields in the Presence of Fed Fund Rate HikesWith the economic expansion continuing strongly and risks shiftingtowards possible inflationary pressures, the US Fed has started reducing thedegree of policy accommodation and raised the policy rate eleven times sinceJune 2004 by a 'measured' 25 basis points each time, with indications of furthersuch hikes. While the PLR of banks in the US has responded to every hike in thetarget federal fund rate, the long-term interest rates that are set by financialmarkets continue to remain unusually low – what Federal Reserve ChairmanGreenspan has referred to as a “conundrum”. The best way to summarise thisissue is to quote from Chairman Greenspan:‘‘In this environment, long-term interest rates have trended lower inrecent months even as the Federal Reserve has raised the level ofthe target federal funds rate by 150 basis points. This developmentcontrasts with most experience, which suggests that, other thingsbeing equal, increasing short-term interest rates are normallyaccompanied by a rise in longer-term yields…For the moment, thebroadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains aconundrum. Bond price movements may be a short-termaberration, but it will be some time before we are able to betterjudge the forces underlying recent experience’’ (Greenspan,2005a).Given the understanding that the long term yield tracks the behaviour ofcurrent and expected inflation (Fama, 1986) along with expected growthperformance of the economy in terms of productivity of capital (Mishkin, 1991),the current behaviour of yield defies conventional wisdom (Table 3).Table 3: Federal Funds Rate, PLR and US Govt. Securities Yield(Per cent)  Federal Fund US 10-Yr.Rate PLR G-Sec Yield2004 May 1.00 4.00 4.72 Jun 1.03 4.01 4.73 Jul 1.26 4.25 4.50 Aug 1.43 4.43 4.28 Sep 1.61 4.58 4.13 Oct 1.76 4.75 4.10 Nov 1.93 4.93 4.19 Dec 2.16 5.15 4.232005 Jan 2.28 5.25 4.22 Feb 2.50 5.49 4.17 Mar 2.63 5.58 4.50 Apr 2.79 5.75 4.34 May 3.00 5.98 4.14 Jun 3.04 6.01 4.00 Jul 3.26 6.25 4.18 Aug 3.50 6.44 4.26 Sep 3.62 6.59 4.20Note: US PLR is the rate posted by a majority of top 25 (by assets in domestic offices) insuredU.S.-chartered commercial banks. It is one of several base rates used by banks to price short-termbusiness loans.Source: U.S FedA host of hypotheses have been put forward as an explanation of theconundrum, inter alia: easy liquidity conditions, glut in global savings overinvestment (Bernanke, 2005), forex reserves build-up in the Asian economies,gradual expected pace of US tightening made possible by a high level ofmonetary credibility, low expected inflation, low term/ risk premia and flight toquality after the dot com crash in 2000. Meanwhile, the low bond yields and flatyield curves have triggered an ever-widening search for yields, aided by thecompression of credit risk spreads. The behaviour of long-term rates to theshort-term policy rates is, thus, posing a threat to the traditional transmissionchannels of monetary policy, looming large on the efficacy of monetarymanagement the world over.Low Consumer Inflation in the Presence ofAbundant Liquidity and Increasing Asset PricesThe global economy is currently awash with liquidity. Exactly seven yearsago, the US Fed responded to the ‘low probability but highly adverse events’(Blinder and Reis, 2005) leading up to the Russian debt default and the LTCMcollapse by an emergency cut in interest rates in September, October andNovember 1998. Even though the reduction was just 25 basis points eachmonth, it shifted the monetary policy stance to accommodation. Once again,prompted by a deflation scare, the fed fund rate was cut over a 42-month stretchfrom December 2000 to June 2003 to a 45 year low of 1 per cent, taking the realfederal funds rate into negative territory. Thus, real policy rates were effectivelyzero or negative until very recently in the US and remain below the “Wicksellian”long-term neutral rate. Real policy rates in the UK and euro area are alsogenerally hovering around zero. Coupled with the benign policy rates, moneysupply growth, which increased in the second half of the 1990s in the UKcontinued at the elevated level during 2000-04. Similarly, money supply growthwent up in Euro area in 2000-04 from a lower level in 1995-99.  Even in the USwhere money supply has lost much of its charm as an information variable, therehas been accelerated money supply growth during 1995-99 which has largelybeen sustained during 2000-04 (Table 4).Table 4: Policy Rates and Growth in Money Supply, Credit,1Asset Prices, Consumer Prices and Producer Prices(Per cent)Variable 1990-94 1995-99 2000-04US Policy Rate 4.9 5.4 2.8Money Supply 1.4 8.5 7.6Reserve Money 7.8 8.6 3.7Credit 3.0 7.5 7.0Equity Prices (Dow Jones) 7.2 24.7 -0.3Housing Prices -1.9 1.9 5.8Producer Prices 1.4 0.8 3.2Consumer Prices 3.6 2.4 2.6UK Policy Rate 9.1 6.3 4.6Money Supply 5.9 7.6 7.6Reserve Money 4.1 4.6 5.3Credit 5.7 7.4 10.3Equity Prices (FTSE 100) 5.8 17.8 -5.9Housing Prices -1.8 4.3 15.3Producer Prices 4.2 1.6 1.1Consumer Prices 4.6 2.8 2.4Euro Policy Rate 2.8 (1999) 3.0area Money Supply 7.1 4.7 6.9Credit 7.9 5.9(’98 to ’99)Equity Prices (Xetra Dax) 12.6 27.8 -5.4(’91-’94)Housing Prices 4.0 3.5 6.8(’91-’95) (’96-’00) (’01-’04)Producer Prices 2.3 1.1 1.4(’91-’95) (’96-’00) (’01-’04)Consumer Prices 3.2 1.6 2.2(’91-’95) (’96-’00) (’01-’04)World Consumer Prices 22.3 8.3 3.8Consumer Prices – 3.8 2.0 1.9    Advanced CountriesConsumer Prices – 12.9 7.6 4.3     Emerging MarketsNon-Oil Commodity Prices -6.1 -4.0 1.91.

Low interest rates in the US have encouraged capital to flow into emergingmarket economies. For the countries that prefer some form of managed parityagainst the US dollar this has resulted in a large build-up of foreign exchangereserves and excessive domestic liquidity, amplifying the Fed's policy stance.Yet, the global supply of dollars reflected in the so-called ‘super money’ (i.e., thesum of cash and banks' reserve holdings at the Fed plus foreign reserves heldby central banks around the world) is estimated to have grown by around 25 percent per annum in the last couple of years (The Economist, September 30,2004).Table 5: Policy Rates, Money Supply Growth, Producer1and Consumer Inflations in Select Emerging Asian Countries(Per cent per annum)  1990-94 1995-99 2000-04China Bank Rate 8.5 7.2 3.0Money Supply 27.6 19.1 16.2Reserve Money 28.8 15.5 12.4Consumer Prices 10.4 5.2 1.0Credit 26.5 20.0 16.5India Policy Rate 11.4 10.6 5.9Money Supply 18.0 13.3 14.0Reserve Money 16.9 11.4 11.5Producer Prices 10.5 5.5 5.2Consumer Prices 10.2 8.9 3.9Credit 13.3 14.9 14.3Thailand Discount Rate 10.5 10.0 3.5Money Supply 20.4 9.1 4.6Reserve Money 16.1 20.4 8.1Producer Prices 2.8 4.5 3.8Consumer Prices 4.8 5.1 1.7Credit 24.2 8.5 0.8Malaysia Money market rate 6.5 6.4 2.7 Money Supply 17.9 14.6 7.3 Reserve Money 21.9 10.9 2.1Producer Prices 2.5 3.6 3.5Consumer Prices 3.8 3.5 1.5Credit 12.7 (’93-’94) 16.4 5.9Korea Discount rate 6.2 4.2 2.5 Money Supply 18.2 7.2 9.2 Reserve Money 14.7 4.2 6.7Producer Prices 3.1 4.4 1.9Consumer Prices 7.0 4.4 3.2Credit 18.1 17.3 12.0Philippines Discount Rate 12.0 11.5 8.0 Money Supply 14.6 20.3 7.8 Reserve Money 13.8 15.5 1.6Producer Prices 4.1 (’94) 6.0 9.6Consumer Prices 11.1 7.0 4.6Credit 40.2 19.8 6.5Indonesia Discount Rate 14.4 19.6 12.2Money Supply 16.0 22.5 17.0Reserve Money 16.9 41.7 15.3Producer Prices 5.9 28.1 8.0Consumer Prices 8.6 20.5 8.0Credit 27.4 29.0 10.61.

While the equity prices shot up in the second half of the 1990s, theycame down subsequently in the wake of dotcom crash. Facilitated by the policyaccommodation in the US and the subsequent easing in the rest of the world, thehousing prices have now witnessed a boom during 2000-04 all over the world.Perhaps the greatest puzzle in current global developments is the co-existence of abundant liquidity and low consumer inflation. Despite theprolonged period over which monetary policy all over the world has remainedaccommodative, inflation has been unusually benign, impervious to soaring oilprices and the elevated prices of non-fuel commodities particularly ferrous andnon-ferrous metals. While the industrial countries have maintained the inflationpressures at low and stable levels both during 1995-99 and 2000-04, there hasbeen noticeable decline in inflation during 2000-04 in emerging marketseconomies. Such low levels of inflation have not been witnessed since the pre-World War period when the discipline of the fixed exchange rates under the goldstandard ensured that prices were roughly stable and episodes of deflation werenot uncommon. The current phenomenon is unique in recent history, promptingsome to visualize the death of inflation though there are signs of its resurrectionin recent weeks.Slowdown in Global Saving and Investment vs. Strong Global GrowthGlobal saving and investment rates have declined in recent years. Globalsaving increased by a fraction in 1995-99 from the level in 1990-94 beforedeclining in 2000-04 (Table 6). While saving as per cent of GDP declined in theU.S, U.K and European Monetary Union (EMU) in 2000-04 from the level in1995-99, the same in China and India witnessed an increase. Thedeclining savings in the industrial countries could have its demographic rootswith aging population weighted against higher saving (Mohan, 2004c).Alongside, the world investment rate declined steadily during the period,ignoring the signals of softening interest rates. Investment in US, UK andEuropean Monetary Union (EMU) fell during 2000-04 with increasing riskaversion on the part of the corporates in the wake of the dot com and otherfinancial crises in 1990s. Investment rate has improved in China during 2000-04while it has declined in India during 2000-03.Notwithstanding the declining saving and investment rates, global growthhas continued its surge from period to period. While consumption has arguablyplayed a critical role in the industrial countries’ growth momentum, exports mighthave played a similar role in the emerging markets. The sustenance ofconsumption as opposed to investment-led growth has thus given rise to newcontroversies on present versus future allocation of resources as also on therelevance of overlapping generation outlooks.Table 6: Global Savings and Investment1990-94 1995-99 2000-04GDP Growth (per cent)    World 2.6 3.7 3.8    EMU 1.9 2.4 1.7    US 2.4 3.9 2.8    UK 1.3 3.0 2.6    India 4.9 6.5 5.7    China 10.7 8.8 8.5Saving (As per cent of GDP)    World 22.0 22.3 21.4    EMU 22.5 22.8 22.5(up to 2003)    US 16.2 17.6 15.2(up to 2002)    UK 15.8 16.6 14.2(up to 2003)    India 22.4 21.7 22.2    China 39.7 42.1 43.6Investment (As per cent of GDP)    World 23.0 22.7 21.6    EMU 22.0 20.8 20.7(up to 2003)    US 17.1 19.3 19.1(up to 2002)    UK 17.1 17.3 16.9(up to 2003)    India 22.9 23.2 22.7(up to 2003)    China 38.0 38.8 40.8Source: World Economic Outlook, IMF and World Development Indicators On-Line,World Bank.Low Inflation despite Currency DepreciationsTraditionally, the degree of exchange rate pass-through, i.e., the speedand extent of transmission of exchange rate movements into domestic pricesused to be an important consideration for the conduct of monetary policy, leadingto the alleged "fear of floating" on the part of the emerging economies (Calvoand Reinhart, 2002). However, there is now increasing evidence that exchangerate pass-through to domestic inflation has tended to decline from the 1990sacross a number of countries. Inflation has turned out to be largely immune andinsensitive, barring the sole exception of Indonesia, to the wild volatility andcurrency depreciation witnessed in Korea, Thailand, the Philippines andMalaysia in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis (Table 7).Similarly, the US dollar’s substantial depreciation against the euro during2002-2004 has not led to inflationary pressures in the US. With inflation standingrock steady even in the face of exchange rate volatility, the traditional channelsof current account adjustment have failed to work towards restoring the externalbalances in a sustainable manner. Further, the weakening of the US dollaragainst the euro has not brought about substantial changes in the trade patternbetween the US and euro area. On the contrary, the US imports from euro areasurged ahead during the phase of US dollar’s depreciation against euro while theUS exports to euro area did not increase, at least initially (Table 8).Table 7: Exchange Rates and Consumer Prices Inflation –Select Asian Countries during the Crisis Year 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000Korea Exchange Rate 805 951 1401 1189 1131(4.3) (18.3) (47.3) (-15.2) (-4.9)CPI Inflation 4.98 4.40 7.54 0.83 2.25Thailand Exchange Rate 25 31 41 38 40 (1.7) (23.8) (31.9) (-8.6) (6.1)CPI Inflation 5.83 5.60 8.07 0.30 1.57Philippines Exchange Rate 26 29 41 39 44 (1.9) (12.4) (38.8) (-4.4) (13.1)CPI Inflation 7.51 5.59 9.27 5.95 3.95Malaysia Exchange Rate 2.52 2.81 3.92 3.80 3.80 (0.5) (11.8) (39.5) (-3.2) (0.0)CPI Inflation 3.49 2.66 5.27 2.75 1.54Indonesia Exchange Rate 2342 2909 10014 7855 8422 (4.2) (24.2) (244.2) (-21.6) (7.2)CPI Inflation 7.97 6.23 58.39 20.49 3.72Note: (1) Exchange Rates are National currencies per US dollar.(2) Figures in bracket are the percentage changes over the previousyear.(3) CPI Inflation rates are annual percentage changesSource: WEO and IFS, IMF.Table 8: Exchange Rate, Trade and Consumer Prices Inflation –Recent Trends in the U.SYear 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004NEER (2000=100) 100 105.94 104.28 91.46 83.97REER (2000=100) 100 103.61 105.18 95.56 86.1Exchange Rate (US $ per 0.924 0.896 0.944 1.131 1.243euro) (-13.4) (-3.0) (5.4) (19.8) (9.9)CPI Inflation (per cent) 3.38 2.83 1.59 2.27 2.68Imports from euro area 226,901 226,568 232,313 253,042 281,959(US $ Million)(13.42) (-0.15) (2.54) (8.92) (11.43)Exports to euro area (US $ 168,181 161,931 146,621 155,170 172,622Million)(8.63) (-3.72) (-9.45) (5.83) (11.25)Figures in bracket are the percentage changes over the previous year.Source: WEO and IFS, IMF and US Census Bureau.III. Possible ExplanationsWhat factors explain these seeming puzzles and counter-intuitiverelationships across a large set of variables? What really explains thedivergence between the PPI and CPI and the imperviousness of consumerprices to liquidity conditions? Is the received wisdom on the relationshipbetween money, output and prices undergoing yet another paradigm shift? Hasthe inflation process changed at its core? Country experiences present a widediversity of circumstances, producing a variety of outcomes.  This makesgeneralizations difficult and even adventurous. Central bankers are not knownto be adventurous, but this opportunity of delivering a dinner speech hasemboldened me.As a central banker, I would like to subscribe to the objective of low andstable inflation in the conduct of monetary policy. Reforms in the manner inwhich monetary policy is set currently, and the institutional changes that haveoccurred in the 1990s have undoubtedly enhanced the reputation of monetaryauthorities in terms of delivering price stability. The current trend of increasinglyindependent central banks, enhanced transparency and greater accountabilityhas, in fact, improved public credibility in these institutions. The institutionalstrengthening of central banks has coincided with the worldwide thrust on fiscalconsolidation and structural reforms in the labour and product markets, whichhave also worked towards attaining price stability. Specified fiscal rules such asthose under the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact in the euroarea have been emulated the world over, charting out explicit road maps forfiscal consolidation. Thus, fiscal deficits in emerging market economies are nowless than half of their levels in 1970s and 1980s. It has been estimated thatinflation could have declined by 5-15 percentage points on account of lowerfiscal deficits in emerging market economies (IMF, 2002). So there are somebroad structural fiscal reasons for the world wide decline in inflation.Globalisation has arguably unleashed the most significant anti-inflationary forces. Lower trade barriers, increased deregulation, innovation andcompetition all over the world have led to exponential growth in cross-bordertrade with world trade racing ahead of output. With the rapid expansion intradables domestic economies are, therefore, increasingly exposed to therigours of international competition and comparative advantage, reducingunwarranted price mark-ups (Greenspan, 2004b). The competition amongnations to attract and retain factors of production has also induced governmentsto reduce entry barriers for new productive activities. Intensified competition inthe domestic economy, which has now become part of the global market-placehas rendered prices more flexible, containing the impact of unanticipatedinflation on output. This has reduced the incentive for monetary authorities toraise output above the potential (Rogoff, 2003). Increasingly, a firm or countrythat can produce for global markets, with the greatest cost efficiency, sets globalprices. Currently, China is perhaps in such a position but other competitors arenot far behind. It, however, needs to be recognized that globalisation may not1continue to maintain its tempo indefinitely into the future.An important contributor to low inflation has also been the productivitygrowth in a number of sectors, partly due to IT investments combined withrestructuring. Even the services sector, which was otherwise believed to lag in                                                          1 It is instructive to turn to Chairman Greenspan, who said, "We have not experienced asufficient number of economic turning points to judge the causal linkages amongincreased globalization, improved monetary policy, significant disinflation and greatereconomic stability" (Greenspan, 2004b).productivity vis-à-vis industry in view of its ‘cost disease’ syndrome, a laBaumol, has witnessed impressive productivity growth with increasedpenetration of IT in most services activities. Productivity growth has beenparticularly discernible in the US from the mid-1990s with continuing signs ofsustenance in the next decade (Oliner and Sichel, 2002). While productivitygrowth in the euro area may not have been as high as in the US, thedisinflationary effects of productivity growth in one region get transmitted acrossborders through increased competition in a globalised world (Table 9).Table 9: Productivity in Manufacturing*(Annual percentage change)1987-96 1997-1999 2000-2004Advanced economies 3.1 3.37 3.76US 2.8 3.97 4.96UK 3.4 3.47 4.42Euro area … 4.13 2.88Japan 2.7 1.57 3.62*: Refers to labour productivity, measured as the ratio of hourly compensation to unitlabour costs.Source: World Economic Outlook, IMF.The impact of cross-country integration is also at work in the labourmarket. An economy which is open to migrant labour exhibits a differentinflationary process from one that is not. An increase in spending raises thepressure of demand on supply and leads to upward pressure on wages    andprices.   But if the increased demand for labour generates its own supply in theform of migrant labour then the link between demand and prices is broken, or atleast altered. Indeed, in an economy that can call on unlimited supplies ofmigrant labour or can go for outsourcing, the concept of output gap may not bethat meaningful (King, 2005). The inflow of migrant labour both in the US and UKhas arguably led to a diminution of inflationary pressure in the labour market  inthese countries (Table 10).Table 10: Net Migration to US and UK*1985-1990 1990-1995 1995-2000US 3,775,000 5,200,000 6,200,000UK 104,310 380,840 574,470*: Number of immigrants less the number of emigrants, including both citizens andnoncitizens.Source: World Development Indicators on Line, World Bank.The expanding canvas of knowledge has also had its impact in the formof low and stable inflation. The technological advances in architecture andengineering as well as development of lighter but stronger materials has resultedin "downsized" output, evident in the huge expansion of the money value ofoutput and trade but not in tonnage. As a consequence, material intensity ofproduction has declined reflecting, "the substitution, in effect, of ideas forphysical matter in the creation of economic value" (Greenspan, 1998). This hascontributed to the secular decline in commodity prices, notwithstanding shortspells of spikes in these prices. The increasing commodity price volatility aroundthe declining trend has, however, engaged the monetary policy attention in theshort-run (Mohan, 2004a). The declining share of commodity prices in final goodsprices has been an important factor, leading to a divergence between PPI andCPI.  Thus even substantial increases in input prices no longer lead tocorresponding increases in output prices and are further muted by the forces ofglobal competition.Thus the persistence of low and stable inflation worldwide despiteconsiderable monetary accommodation in recent years can be explained byinvoking these new economic developments in the real economy.  The role ofcentral banks in the recent containment of inflation can, at best, be seen to havelimited applicability.For industrial countries, the exchange rate pass-through to consumerprice inflation has been found to have almost halved in the 1990s compared tothe pre-1990s period (Gagnon and Ihrig, 2001; McCarthy, 2000). Furthermore,the pass-through has reportedly declined more in developing countries in the1990s than in the advanced economies (Frankel, Parsley and Wei, 2004).Financial innovations such as the availability of hedging products have alsolowered the degree of pass-through by enabling exporters and importers toignore temporary shocks and set stable product prices despite large currencyfluctuations:  Witness the lack of price change in BMWs, Mercedes andPorsches in the United States despite substantial dollar depreciation withrespect to the euro. The import composition of the industrial countries is foundto have shifted in favour of sectors with low pass-through such as themanufacturing sector. There is also a view that, in some cases, the lowobserved pass-through might be due to disappearance of expensive goods fromconsumption and their replacement by inferior local substitutes (Burstein,Eichenbaum and Rebelo, 2003): i.e., no more Mercedes and BMWs!The increasing share of non-tradables in GDP has also worked towardscontaining the exchange rate pass through. Non-tradables generallyapproximated by services have increased their share in all major industrialcountries as also in China and India. As populations age, demand moves morein favour of services than for goods. Thus, the aging population in industrialcountries has provided much of the growth impetus for services. With the shift indemand composition in favour of services, no wonder, the extent of exchangerate pass-through, which works primarily through tradables has been limited(Table 11).The role of exchange rate movements or policy induced adjustments ininfluencing behaviour of economic agents through the domestic pricemechanism appears to have been significantly truncated.  If an exchange ratedepreciation (appreciation) does not appreciably increase (decrease) domesticprices of imported goods, there would be little reason to expect a reduction(increase) in demand for imported products.  Hence small exchange ratechanges can scarcely be expected to help significantly in effecting changes inthe current account.There has been reduced volatility of GDP growth in most G-7 countriesover the past three decades, coinciding with growing integration andsynchronization of business cycles (Mohan, 2004a). The standard deviation ofUS GDP growth during 1984-2002 was two-thirds of that during 1960-83. Thiscould have also contributed to lowering inflation (Stock and Watson, 2003). Thegrowing share of services - a sector less susceptible to volatility - betterinventory management, and easy access to credit with financial deepening, havealso brought down the volatility of GDP growth and, therefore, expectations offuture inflation.Table 11: Share of Services in GDP(Per cent) Country 1990-94 1995-99 2000-04US 71.71 72.89 74.65 (up to 2001)UK 65.55 67.91 71.62 (up to 2003)Japan 60.26 64.92 67.45 (up to 2002)Euro area 64.25 67.24 69.21 (up to 2003)China 32.74 31.36 33.72India 42.16 45.14 50.44Source: World Development Indicators on Line, World Bank.The global financial landscape has undergone a sea change over the lastcouple of decades, characterized by increasing liberalization and growingcompleteness of markets and institutions. The pursuit of flexible exchange ratesfor the major currencies from the 1970s has made the spot and forward foreignexchange markets strikingly efficient in tracking the expectations of economicagents. Alongside, the broadening and deepening of the secondary andderivatives markets for government and other fixed income securities has addedto the flows of market information. With the onset of de-mystification anddecomposition of risks, there has been a deluge of new financial products,enabling economic agents to manage, hedge or lay off risks. Simultaneously,there has been discernible improvement in the institutional infrastructure - legalor informational - providing a durable basis for efficient functioning of thefinancial markets. With the arrival of options pricing in the early 1970s, more andmore complex financial products are hitting the market every day. Financialmarkets - at least in the industrial countries - have, thus, transformed themselvesinto super-efficient vehicles for allocating resources and spreading risks acrosssectors, time and space. The lower costs of financial intermediation, the greaterscope for risk spreading, and the reduced reliance on any individual institution ormarket channel for the intermediation of savings and investment have had aspurring effect on financial activities undertaken by households, businesses andgovernments. Thus, the global financial system appears to be more robust andresilient to financial shocks emanating from individual countries. Certainly, theincreasing confidence of the financial system has its reflection in the sustainedglobal growth and taming of inflation all over world (Blinder and Reis, 2005).The growing sophistication of financial markets has therefore, paradoxically,reduced the power of the price mechanism in bringing about changes in adesired policy direction.It is, therefore, possible that such developments in financial markets havehad the effect of reducing risks across the board, both spatially and temporally.Such developments have received further support from the increased focus ofcentral banks on inflation containment and stability, along with overall financialstability. The accompanying institutional changes, mainly the increasedacceptance of central bank autonomy, have probably contributed toenhancement of their credibility.   Thus there could be a secular decline in riskperception and in medium and long term inflationary expectations, therebyreducing the neutral real interest rate.  If these conjectures have some elementof validity, the effect of changes in short term policy rates on long term yieldswould be muted, as seems to have happened in the United States.Paradoxically then, the central banks' own success could have blunted theefficacy of their most powerful policy instrument: the short term interest rate.As regards the muted impact of soaring oil prices on the general pricelevel and economic activities, it needs to be recognized that unlike in the pastwhen oil price surges were driven by supply shocks, the current bull market in oilis mainly the result of a perceived secular increase in demand emanating fromaccelerated growth in our countries, which, moreover, is expected to continue inthe foreseeable future. The sharp rise in oil prices is perceived to have beentriggered by sustained global growth, particularly in the US among developedcountries, and from increasing contributions from the emerging marketeconomies that tend to demand relatively more oil than the developed world for asimilar expansion in output. The higher oil prices of the 1970s brought to anabrupt end the extraordinary period of growth in US oil consumption. Between1945 and 1973, consumption of petroleum products in the U.S rose at a startling4.5 per cent average annual rate, well in excess of real GDP growth. However,between 1973 and 2004, oil consumption in the U.S grew, on an average, only0.5 per cent per annum, far short of the rise in real GDP (Greenspan, 2005b).The mandated fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks coupled with theimports of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars and the increasing share ofservices sector in GDP induced slower growth of gasoline demand in the US.Thus, while the oil intensity of output has fallen in the industrial countries, e.g.,from the peak of 0.19 Kg per real US dollar in the US in 1970 to 0.09 Kg per realUS dollar in 2000, the relatively slower decline for developing countries such asChina and India has been neutralized by the pace of rise in incomes (Table 12).Unlike the oil shocks of the 1970s, when the oil surplus with the oilexporting countries mainly found its way out into conspicuous consumption, thistime around, the oil exporting countries seem to be doing a much better job ofrecycling the oil surpluses into the global economy. For example, the OPECcountries are running only a marginal trade surplus with China as they areimporting a range of goods from China, which is using more oil to manufacturethose goods. Oil exporting countries have also been active in the internationalinvestment arena, using their export revenue to buy stocks and bonds in variouscountries, thereby keeping the global cost of capital low.Table 12: Oil Intensity in Select Countries (Using Constant US $ GDP)(Kg. of oil per real US $)1970 1980 1990 2000 2003World 0.18 0.17 0.13 0.11 0.11US 0.19 0.15 0.11 0.09 0.09UK 0.14 0.09 0.07 0.05 0.05Japan 0.11 0.09 0.06 0.05 0.05France 0.15 0.13 0.08 0.07 0.07Germany 0.15 0.12 0.08 0.07 0.07India 0.17 0.21 0.22 0.23 0.21China 0.30 0.52 0.27 0.21 0.19Malaysia 0.24 0.32 0.29 0.23 0.22Indonesia 0.27 0.37 0.30 0.33 0.32Philippines 0.27 0.23 0.20 0.22 0.18South Korea 0.14 0.20 0.17 0.20 0.18Thailand 0.27 0.31 0.25 0.28 0.28Brazil 0.14 0.14 0.13 0.14 0.13Mexico 0.11 0.14 0.16 0.15 0.14Source: British Petroleums Statistical Review of World Energy and WorldDevelopment Indicators On Line, World Bank.Furthermore, the self-equilibrating demand-supply mechanism in the faceof the rising oil prices has been kept in abeyance in a number of countries. Whilethe current oil cycle has witnessed a doubling in the price of oil over the pastthree years, on average only a third of the price increase has been passed on toend users. While Europe and Japan have cut down high taxes on oilconsumption to cushion the impact of higher oil prices, governments in manydeveloping countries are subsiding oil prices in recognition of the lower resilienceof low income people to sudden price shocks. ‘‘But if history is any guide, shouldhigher prices persist, energy use will over time continue to decline, relative toGDP. Long-term demand elasticities have proved noticeably higher than thosethat are evident in the short term’’ (Greenspan, 2005b). Nevertheless, since oiluse is only two-thirds as important an input into world GDP as it was threedecades ago, the effect of the current surge in oil prices, though noticeable, islikely to prove significantly less than in 1970s.The entry into the world economy of the erstwhile centrally plannedeconomies, in general, and China, in particular, has arguably constituted amassive positive supply shock, raising the world's potential growth, holding downinflation and triggering changes in the relative prices of labour, capital, goodsand assets (BIS, 2005). In this context, the desirability of positive inflation rateshas been questioned in certain circles. In other words, are central bankstargeting too high a rate of inflation now that China has joined the global marketeconomy?During the era of rapid globalisation in the late 19th century, fallingaverage prices were quite common. This “good deflation”, which wasaccompanied by robust growth, was very different from the bad deflationexperienced in the 1930s depression. Today, we could have been in yet anotherphase of “good deflation” but central banks have favoured low but positiveinterest rates while setting and meeting their inflation targets. Furthermore,China's entry into the global economy has raised the worldwide return on capital.That, in turn, should imply an increase in the equilibrium level of real interestrates. But, central banks are holding real rates at historically low levels and onefinds scenarios of excessive credit growth, mortgage borrowing and housinginvestment. In this context, however, some estimates suggest that the impact ofChinese exports on global inflation has been fairly modest. China's exports couldhave reduced (i) global inflation by 30 basis points per annum; (ii) US importprice inflation by 80 basis points (but in view of the US being a relatively closedeconomy, the impact on producer and consumer prices has likely been quitesmall); and (iii) import unit values inflation by 10-25 basis points in the OECDcountries (Kamin, Marazzi and Schindler, 2004). These estimates should betreated as upper bounds since they ignore the fact that China's rapid exportgrowth has also been associated with equally rapid import growth and China is,therefore, contributing not only to global supply but also global demand. This isalso reflected in the sharp rise in global commodity prices beginning early 2003.IV. The Way AheadMeasured by the growth in global credit or property prices, some parts ofthe world are currently experiencing strong asset price inflation. As withtraditional inflation, the surging asset prices distort relative prices and cause amisallocation of resources. For instance, since households think they arewealthier, they spend more and save and invest less. The risk is that as interestrates rise, the fragility of the economic recovery would be exposed and decisionsbased on cheap credit would look less than wise.Whereas there is no question about the desirability of maintainingfinancial stability, monetary policy is often considered to be too blunt aninstrument to achieve financial stability, especially to counter threats from assetprice misalignments. Indeed, it is often difficult to adjudge ex ante as to whetherasset price misalignments are bubbles or not. Second, even if the bubble isidentified on a real time basis, the typical monetary tightening measures such asincrease in interest rates may not be effective in deflating asset price bubbles.In view of such limitations of monetary policy actions as also the fact thatinflationary pressures take more than the usual time to surface in conditions oflow inflation, central banks need to take cognizance of emerging financialimbalances by lengthening their monetary policy horizons beyond the usual two-year framework. More importantly, in view of the possibility of the role of pricesbecoming muted as an equilibrating mechanism, whether in terms of changes inexchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices, central banks will have tocontribute to financial stability more through prudential regulation andsupervision to address the emergence of financial sector excesses orimbalances arising from excess liquidity or other economic imbalances. Indeed,greater transparency and cooperation between monetary policy and supervisionis being increasingly recognized and many central banks are exploringalternatives as opposed to the traditional monetary policy instruments.Given the fact that the defining characteristic of the monetary policylandscape is ‘uncertainty’, no simple rule could possibly describe the policyaction to be taken in every contingency (Greenspan, 2004a). As a consequence,the conduct of monetary policy has come to involve, at its core, crucial elementsof risk management. This conceptual framework emphasizes understanding asmuch as possible the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakersface, quantifying those risks when possible, and assessing the costs associatedwith each of the risks.Under these conditions, the separation of the function of financialregulation and supervision from central banking has come up for criticalreappraisal. Even though a formal separation of functions may have becomemore common than in the past, there remains a question whether that changewould make much difference to the practical realities (Goodhart, 1995). In theirquest for financial stability, central banks worldwide have exhibited a variety ofresponses. On the one hand, several central banks have been given an explicitmandate to promote financial stability. Another broad category of response hasbeen the constitution of independent departments to oversee financial stability.Illustratively, at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the banking supervisiondepartment and financial markets department were merged into a FinancialStability Department, headed by a Deputy Governor. In the Netherlands, thenewly established Financial Stability Division concentrates experienced staffmembers from monetary policy, supervision, financial markets, oversight andresearch departments. At the ECB, the area concerned with financial stabilitymatters (Prudential Supervision Division) was upgraded to a Directorate(Financial Stability and Supervision), which reports to a member of the ExecutiveBoard, and plays a coordination role for euro area/ EU financial stabilitymonitoring. Finally, the Bank of England has recently constituted a dedicatedFinancial Stability Department for oversight of financial stability matters. Thetransfer of supervisory responsibilities outside the central bank in severalcountries has also led central banks to focus their attention on systemic issuesas reflected in a reorientation of organisational arrangements.The traditional signals such as inflation, interest rates and exchangerates are today overly anchored while the global economy is on a long leashsupported by easy finance. However, the increasing potential for sharpcorrections in the medium term needs to be contained by following a two-foldstrategy: consumption needs to give way smoothly to investment with thewithdrawal of policy accommodation in industrial countries, and the locus ofdomestic demand needs to shift from countries running deficits to ones withsurpluses so as to reduce the current account imbalances. Obviously,coordinated policy initiatives have to be high on the agenda of the globalcommunity for ensuring a smooth transition.If it is indeed true that the efficacy of price based indirect monetary policyinstruments has become blunted because of central banks' own success incontaining inflation and muting expectations, along with the increasingsophistication of financial markets, what alternatives do we now have to addressthe emerging global imbalances?  Ironically, the answer perhaps is that we mayneed to return to more quantity based instruments, either through micro actionsby central banks or structural actions by the fiscal authorities.  Central bankswould perhaps have to again resort to activating more detailed prudential,regulatory and supervisory roles aimed at disciplining different segments of thefinancial markets.  Similarly, if external imbalances are perceived to arisebecause of fiscal imbalances, they will have to be attacked directly, rather thanthrough increasingly ineffective exchange rate signals.This finally gives me an opportunity to provide some illustrations fromrecent monetary management actions in China and India.The People’s Bank of China has been trying to contain the possibledownside risks by way of a range of direct and indirect instruments. Requiredreserve ratios have been lifted several times, within the context of a newlydifferentiated reserve requirement system aimed at better aligning the degree ofrestraint with the degree of excess credit expansion, institution by institution.Moral suasion has been used with “window guidance” and “credit policy advice”in relation to credit allocation including warnings on the riskiness of increasingexposures to certain overheated sectors. Benchmark interest rates wereincreased by about 0.3 percentage points in October 2004. At the same time, theupper limit on interest rates charged by commercial banks was abolished, andthe limits for urban and rural cooperatives was increased to 2.3 times thebenchmark rate. The interest rates that the PBC charges for providing short termliquidity support were increased by between 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points, andthe PBC was given additional room to adjust these rates according to economicand financial conditions. PBC has also continued its sterilisation operations byway of changes in reserve ratios, open market operations and issuance ofcentral bank bills in the wake of strong forex inflows. China has also revalued itscurrency and the yuan now floats against a basket of currencies. This policy ofhaving greater flexibility in the exchange rate would allow monetary authorities toguard against the risk of any further increase in inflation in both product andasset markets.  Thus, as I understand it, China has used a judicious mix oftraditional monetary instruments, along with a selection of detailed prudentialand regulatory instruments to deal with the possibility of overheating in theeconomy.In India, monetary management has had to contend with testingchallenges on several fronts  - an increase in domestic prices in the first half of2004 driven largely by a sustained increase in international commodity pricesincluding fuel, a large overhang of domestic liquidity generated by capital inflowsand the upturn in the international interest rate cycle. The Reserve Bank of Indiahas, therefore, had to strike a fine balance between reining in inflationaryexpectations, encouraging the impulses of growth and ensuring financialstability. In early 2004, it was recognised that the finite stock of Governmentpaper with the Reserve Bank could potentially circumscribe the scope of outrightopen market operations for sterilising capital flows which were last carried out inJanuary 2004. The Reserve Bank cannot issue its own paper under the extantprovisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and such an option hasgenerally not been favoured in India. Central bank bills/bonds would impose theentire cost of sterilisation on the Reserve Bank's balance sheet. Besides, theexistence of two sets of risk-free paper – gilts and central bank securities – tendsto fragment the market. Accordingly, the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), whichoperates through repos of government paper to create a corridor for overnightinterest rates and thereby functions as an instrument of day-to-day liquiditymanagement, had to be relied upon for sterilization as well. Under thesecircumstances, the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) was introduced in April2004 to provide the monetary authority an additional instrument of liquiditymanagement and sterilisation. Under the MSS, the Government issues Treasurybills and dated government securities to mop up domestic liquidity and parks theproceeds in a ring-fenced deposit account with the RBI. The funds can beappropriated only for redemption and/or buyback of paper issued under theMSS. Besides an increase in the MSS ceiling, raising of the cash reserve ratio(CRR), lowering the rate of remuneration on the eligible CRR balances, hikes inthe reverse repo rate by 25 basis points each in October 2004, April 2005 andOctober 2005, several measures were also initiated to maintain asset quality ofthe banking system at a time of rapid credit growth.The runaway oil prices riding on the back of growing demand in a cyclicalupturn are currently looming large on the pace and pattern of the growthperformance in both the economies. While the economies have so far absorbedthe oil shocks in their stride and with surprising resilience, continuinguncertainties on the oil front, however, pose a question mark on their sustainedperformance. Paradoxically, the reserves build-up with the Asian central banks,with its attendant cost implications has started slowing down of late with thesoaring oil prices cutting into the oil importers’ trade and current accountsurpluses. However, the growing transfer on account of oil portends yet anotherrisk in terms of the sustenance of current accounts. Besides, FDI and portfolioinflows are also showing signs of fatigue in several Asian countries with thehardening of the rates in the US. With sudden reversals of expectations, theAsian economies thus, run the risk of disruption in their financial and realmarkets.Several countries in Asia have followed a relatively flexible exchange ratepolicy to ensure smooth adjustment along with corrections in the world economy.Such flexibility has served these countries well. However, the world has to guardagainst any new risks arising out of any large corrections in the exchange ratesof the world’s major currencies accompanied by rising inflation and interest rates(Mohan, 2004b). First, the protectionist tendencies need to be curbed in keepingwith the multilateral spirit of trade negotiations. Second, we need to workcollectively towards developing a sound international financial architecture, thelack of which, it may be recalled, has led to excessive caution on the part ofdeveloping countries in building large reserves. Third, given the need forfinancial stability alongside monetary stability, central banks need to be cautiousbefore joining the recent trend of separating the monetary and supervisoryauthorities, particularly in view of the muted responses to the pricing channels ofmonetary policy. In the recent past, faced with an unprecedented rise in housingcredit, the Reserve Bank of India has raised the risk weight of housing loans as acounter cyclical action for the purpose of maintenance of capital to risk assetsratio.
