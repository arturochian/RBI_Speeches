BANKING SECTOR IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVEInaugural Address byDr. Y. Venugopal Reddy, Governor, RBIatBankers’ Conference, 2004Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,It is indeed a pleasure and privilege to be amidst this augustgathering of eminent bankers, experts and policymakers. Over the years,the Conference has evolved as an important forum for structuredinformation sharing among not only delegates from the banking sector, butalso experts from research institutions, credit rating agencies, internationalinstitutions and other financial sector bodies. The Bankers’ Conference,2004 is a great advancement over the previous years. The most notablefeature is that Respected President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is addressingthis gathering. In addition, we also have here today, globally renownedpolicy makers amidst us who will give us the benefit of their views. Theseinclude, Ms. Anne Krueger, First Managing Director of the IMF, a dear friendof mine, and a distinguished Central Banker, Governor Caruana of Bank ofSpain who is also Chairman of the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision.The subjects selected for the Conference are of great importanceand we, in RBI, look forward to the benefit of your deliberations. Myinaugural address today will be brief and in the nature of a few commentson the status of Indian banking industry and challenges ahead in a globalperspective.I. Status of Indian Banking IndustryIt is useful to note some telling facts about the status of the Indianbanking industry juxtaposed with other countries, recognising thedifferences between the developed and the emerging economies.2First, the structure of the industry : In the world’s top 1000 banks,there are many more large and medium-sized domestic banks from thedeveloped countries than from the emerging economies. Illustratively,according to The Banker 2004, out of the top 1000 banks globally, over 200are located in USA, just above 100 in Japan, over 80 in Germany, over 40in Spain and around 40 in the UK. Even China has as many as 16 bankswithin the top 1000, out of which, as many as 14 are in the top 500. India,on the other hand, had 20 banks within the top 1000 out of which only 6were within the top 500 banks. This is perhaps reflective of differences insize of economies and of the financial sectors.Second, the share of bank assets in the aggregate financial sectorassets : In most emerging markets, banking sector assets comprise wellover 80 per cent of total financial sector assets, whereas these figures aremuch lower in the developed economies. Furthermore, deposits as a shareof total bank liabilities have declined since 1990 in many developedcountries, while in developing countries public deposits continue to bedominant in banks.  In India, the share of banking assets in total financialsector assets is around 75 per cent, as of end-March 2004. There is, nodoubt, merit in recognising the importance of diversification in theinstitutional and instrument-specific aspects of financial intermediation in theinterests of wider choice, competition and stability. However, the dominantrole of banks in financial intermediation in emerging economies andparticularly in India, will continue in the medium-term; and the banks willcontinue to be “special” for a long time. In this regard, it is useful toemphasise the dominance of banks in the developing countries in promotingnon-bank financial intermediaries and services including in development ofdebt-markets. Even where role of banks is apparently diminishing inemerging markets, substantively, they continue to play a leading role in non-banking financing activities, including the development of financial markets.Third, internationalisation of banking operations : The foreigncontrolled banking assets, as a proportion of total domestic banking assets,increased significantly in several European countries (Austria, Ireland,3Spain, Germany and Nordic countries), but increases have been fairly smallin some others (UK and Switzerland). Amongst the emerging economies,while there was marked increase of foreign-controlled ownership in severalLatin American economies, the increase has, at best, been modest in theAsian economies.  Available evidence seems to indicate some correlationbetween the extent of liberalisation of capital account in the emergingmarkets and the share of assets controlled by foreign banks. As per theevidence available, the foreign banks in India, which are present in the formof branches, seem to enjoy greater freedom in their operations, includingretail banking, in the country on par with domestic banks, as compared withmost of the other developing countries. Furthermore, the profitability of theiroperations in India is considerably higher than that of the domestically-owned banks and, in fact, is higher than the foreign banks’ operations inmost other developing countries. India continues to grant branch licencesmore liberally than the commitments made to the WTO.Fourth, the share of state-owned banks in total banking sectorassets : Emerging economies, with predominantly Government-ownedbanks, tend to have much higher state-ownership of banks compared totheir developed counterparts. While many emerging countries chose toprivatise their public sector banking industry after a process of absorption ofthe overhang problems by the Government, we have encouraged state-runbanks to diversify ownership by inducting private share capital throughpublic offerings rather than by strategic sales and still absorb the overhangproblems. The process has helped reduce the burden on the Government,enhance transparency, encourage market discipline and improve efficiencyas reflected in stock market valuation, promote efficient new private sectorbanks, while drastically reducing the share of the wholly government ownedpublic sector banks in a rapidly growing industry.  Our successful reform ofpublic sector banks is a good example of a dynamic mix of public andprivate ownership in banks.A noteworthy feature of banking reforms in India is the growth ofnewly licensed private sector banks, some of which have attained globally4best standards in terms of technology, services and sophistication. In manyrespects related to performance, these domestically promoted banks havesurpassed branches of foreign banks in India, and could be a role model forother banks.II. Challenges AheadLet me highlight some thoughts on certain areas which have a keybearing on the ability of Indian banks to remain competitive and enhancesoundness.  Needless to state, these are more in the nature of randomthoughts, rather than any structured thinking, and are meant to invitediscussion.First, cost management.  Cost containment is a key to sustainabilityof bank profits as well as their long-term viability. To highlight this point, letme, take recourse to some figures. In 2003, operating costs of banks as a1proportion of total average assets in the UK were 2.12 per cent, for those inSwitzerland they were 2.03 per cent, and less than 2 per cent in majorEuropean economies like Sweden, Austria, Germany and France. In India,however, in 2003, operating costs as proportion of total assets of scheduledcommercial banks stood at 2.24 per cent. The tasks ahead are thus clearand within reach.Second, recovery management. This is a key to the stability of thebanking sector. There should be no hesitation in stating that Indian bankshave done a remarkable job in containment of non-performing loans (NPL)considering the overhang issues and overall difficult environment. Let meadd that for 2004, the net NPL ratio for the Indian scheduled commercialbanks at 2.9 per cent is ample testimony to the impressive efforts beingmade by our banking system.  In fact, recovery management is also linkedto the banks’ interest margins. We must recognise that cost and recoverymanagement supported by enabling legal framework hold the key to futurehealth and competitiveness of the Indian banks. No doubt, improving                                                1 Average assets defined as total assets at the beginning of the year plus total assets at thebeginning of the subsequent year divided by 25recovery-management in India is an area requiring expeditious and effectiveactions in legal, institutional and judicial processes.Third, technological intensity of banking: This is one area whereperhaps India needs to do significant ‘catching up’, notwithstanding therapid strides made over the last few years, though data on this score aredifficult to come by. Some available figures indicate that in late 1999, thepercentage of customers using online banking was less than 1 per cent inIndia, compared with anywhere between 6-30 per cent in developedeconomies like US, UK, Germany, Finland and Sweden. Even in LatinAmerica, these figures are much higher than for India. While admittedly thenumbers for India are likely to be much higher at present than these figuressuggest, so would be the case for these other economies as well. Theissue, therefore, remains what has been the extent of ‘catching up’ by Indiaon this score? In fact, this seems somewhat intriguing: India happens to bea world leader in information technology, but its usage by our bankingsystem is somewhat muted. It is wise for Indian banks to exploit this globallystate-of-art expertise, domestically available, to their fullest advantage.Fourth, risk management. Banking in modern economies is allabout risk management. The successful negotiation and implementation ofBasel II Accord is likely to lead to an even sharper focus on the riskmeasurement and risk management at the institutional level. Thankfully, theBasel Committee has, through its various publications, provided usefulguidelines on managing the various facets of risk. The institution of soundrisk management practices would be an important pillar for staying ahead ofthe competition. Banks can, on their part, formulate ‘early warningindicators’ suited to their own requirements, business profile and riskappetite in order to better monitor and manage risks.Fifth, governance. The recent irregularities involving accountingfirms in the US have amply demonstrated the importance of good corporategovernance practices.  The quality of corporate governance in the banksbecomes critical as competition intensifies, banks strive to retain their clientbase, and regulators move out of controls and micro-regulation. As already6mentioned, banks are special in emerging markets since they take a leadingrole in development of other financial intermediaries and of financialmarkets, apart from having a large recourse to public deposits. No doubt,there is nothing like an ‘optimal’ level of governance for one to be satisfiedwith.  The objective should be to continuously strive for excellence. The RBIhas, on its part, made significant efforts to improve governance practices inbanks, drawing upon international best practices. It is heartening to notethat corporate governance presently finds explicit mention in the annualreports of several banks. The improved corporate governance practicewould also provide an opportunity to accord greater freedom to the banks’boards and move away from micro regulation to macro management.Banks in India are custodians of depositors’ monies, monies of the millionsof depositors who are seeking safe avenues for their hard earned savings,and hence, banks must accept and perform an effective fiduciary role. Inthis light, improvement in policy-framework, regulatory regime, market-perceptions, and indeed, popular sentiments relating to governance inbanks need to be on the top of the agenda – to serve our society’s needsand realities while being in harmony with the global perspective.Thank you.
