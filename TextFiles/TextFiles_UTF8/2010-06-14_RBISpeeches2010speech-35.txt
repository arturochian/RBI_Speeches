    1 Perspectives on Lending Rates in India    Shri Dua, Shri Sen and friends. I thank the Bankers Club, Kolkata and        Shri J.P. Dua, Chairman, Allahabad Bank for providing me the opportunity to speak  to you this evening. As you know, banks will be switching over to a base rate  st system of loan pricing from 1 July 2010. Besides the announcement of base rate,  what is of greater significance is that it brings to fruition complete deregulation of  rupee lending rates of banks, a process that began two decades ago. This is also a  testimony to the maturity of the Indian banking system considering that earlier  attempts at interest rate deregulation were not very successful.  2. What I propose to do is to briefly trace the process of lending rate deregulation  and address a few issues that have arisen in the context of the base rate system. I will  conclude with some observation about the relationship between inflation-adjusted real  lending rate and credit growth and its implication for overall economic growth.     I.  Deregulation of Lending Rates  3. With the objective of providing credit to the productive sectors of the  economy, bank lending rates as well as the allocation of bank credit were closely  regulated by the Reserve Bank till the late 1980s. Furthermore, there were a number  of sector-specific, programme-specific and purpose-specific credit stipulations.  With  the initiation of financial sector reforms in the early 1990s, various steps were taken  to deregulate the lending rates of commercial banks. First, the credit limit size classes  of scheduled commercial banks, on which administered rates were prescribed, were  compressed into three slabs in April 1993. Second, a system of prime lending rate  (PLR), the rate charged for the prime borrowers of the bank, was introduced in  October 1994. The PLR system went through several modifications from a single  PLR to multiple PLRs and then to a Benchmark PLR (BPLR) (Table 1).                                                       1 Speech by Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, delivered at the Bankers  th Club, Kolkata on 11 June 2010. The assistance provided by Dr.Himanshu Joshi, Shri S. Gangadharan  and Shri Dhirendra Gajbhiye  is acknowledged. Table 1:  Evolution of Lending Rate Structure in India    The structure of lending rates was rationalized into six size-wise slabs. Of  Sep. 1990 these, banks were free to set interest rates on loans of over Rs.2 lakh with  minimum lending rates prescribed by RBI.  April 1992 Slabs compressed into four.   April 1993  Slabs compressed into three.   Lending rates for loans with credit limits of over Rs. 2 lakh deregulated.   Oct. 1994  Banks were required to declare their Prime lending rates (PLRs).   Banks allowed to prescribe separate PLRs and spreads over PLRs, both for  Feb. 1997        loan and cash credit components.   For term loans of 3 years and above, separate Prime Term Lending Rates  Oct. 1997  (PTLRs) were required to be announced by banks.  April 1998 PLR converted as a ceiling rate on loans up to Rs.2 lakh.  April 1999 Tenor-linked Prime Lending Rates (TPLRs) introduced.   Banks were given flexibility to charge interest rates without reference to the  Oct. 1999  PLR in respect of certain categories of loans/credit.   Banks allowed to charge fixed/floating rate on their lending for credit limit of  April 2000  over Rs.2 lakh.  The PLR ceased to be the floor rate for loans above Rs. 2 lakh.  April 2001  Banks allowed to lend at sub-PLR rate for loans above Rs.2 lakh.  Dissemination of range of interest rates through the Reserve Banks website  April 2002  was introduced.  Benchmark PLR (BPLR) system introduced and tenor-linked PLRs  April 2003  discontinued.   Draft circular on Base Rate placed on RBI web site for obtaining  Feb. 2010  comments/suggestions from public/stakeholders.   Base Rate system of loan pricing introduced effective July 1, 2010. Rupee  April 2010  lending rate structure completely deregulated    4. Another important development during this time was the introduction of a  loan system of delivery of bank credit in April 1995.  The objective was to bring  about greater discipline in the utilisation of bank credit.  Furthermore, the Reserve  Bank relaxed the requirement of PLR being the floor rate for loans above Rs.2 lakh.  Thus, in April 2001, commercial banks were allowed to lend at sub-PLR rates for  loans above Rs.2 lakh.  However, the divergence in PLRs and the widening of spreads  for borrowers continued to persist.  The PLRs turned out to be rigid and inflexible in  relation to the overall direction of interest rates in the economy.  In order to address  these issues, a BPLR system was introduced in April 2003.    5. However, the BPLR system evolved in a manner that did not meet the  objectives. Competition in an environment of excess liqidity had forced the pricing of  a significant proportion of loans far out of alignment with BPLRs undermining its role  as a reference rate. Furthermore, there was a growing public perception of under-  2pricing of credit for corporates and over-pricing of credit to agriculture as well as  small and medium enterprises. Several requests were received by the Reserve Bank  from banks suggesting a review of the BPLR system.   6. The lack of transparency in the BPLR system also hindered transmission of  monetary policy signals. In view of the concerns pertaining to the shortcomings in the  BPLR system raised by the public and those recognised by the Reserve Bank, the  Annual Policy Statement for 2009-10 announced the constitution of a Working Group  on BPLR to review the BPLR system and suggest changes to make credit pricing  more transparent. On the basis of the recommendations of the Working Group  (Chairman: Deepak Mohanty) and after taking into account the views of various  stakeholders and discussions with banks final guidelines on the base rate system were  announced on April 9, 2010.     II.  The Base Rate System st 7. The base rate system will replace the BPLR system with effect from 1 July  2010. Base rate shall include all those elements of the lending rates that are common  across all categories of borrowers. Banks may choose any benchmark to arrive at the  base rate for a specific tenor that may be disclosed transparently.   Banks are free to  use any other methodology, provided it is consistent, and is made available for  supervisory review. Banks will determine their actual lending rates on loans with  reference to the base rate and by including such other customer specific charges as  considered appropriate.  8. With the introduction of the base rate system, all categories of loans will be  priced only with reference to the base rate with a few exceptions. The base rate can  also serve as the reference benchmark rate for floating rate loan products, apart from  other external market benchmark rates. The floating interest rate based on external  benchmarks should, however, be equal to or above the base rate at the time of  sanction or renewal.   9. Since the base rate will be the minimum rate for all loans, the current  stipulation of BPLR as the ceiling rate for loans up to Rs.200,000 is withdrawn. It is  expected that this will increase the credit flow to small borrowers at reasonable rates   3and  direct bank finance will provide effective competition to other forms of high cost  credit. The interest rate on rupee export credit has also been deregulated.    10. Keeping in view the largely retail deposit-based banking in India, there is a  need for a benchmark for transparent pricing of loans.  Even in wholesale fund- based  banking systems, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is widely used as a  benchmark which is essentially an interbank deposit rate.  Thus, the base rate fulfills  the requirement of a benchmark while giving full flexibility to banks with regards to  its computation and overall loan pricing.  III. Lending Rates in India     11. Let me now turn to an analysis of lending rates in India. The movements in  2 nominal weighted average lending rate for the banking industry as a whole has  shown a gradual decline.  It has come down from a range of 16-17 per cent in most  part of the 1990s to about 11.5 per cent by 2008-09.  The declining trend is clearly  visible in the 2000s (Chart 1). However, wide dispersion persists in actual lending  rates owing to substantial sub-BPLR lending.      Chart 1: Nominal Weighted Average Lending Rates of Banks    18.0 17.0 16.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 Year                                                         2  It has been worked out by using account level data for advances as at end-March each year as  reported in Basic Statistical Returns (BSR) 1A.   4 Lending Rate  (%) 1990 -91 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-0912. How does one explain the trend in the lending rates?  First, at a fundamental  level the decline in the inflation rate between the 1990s and 2000s contributed to lower  3 nominal lending rates .  Second, lower inflation volatility in the 2000s reduced the  inflation risk premia.  Third, significant productivity improvement in the banking  system lowered the intermediation cost (Table 2).   Fourth, the observed decline in  weighted average lending rates in the banking system can be attributed to the  improvements in pricing of risk due to the increased space provided by progressive  deregulation of lending rates.

Similarly CPI inflation declined from 9.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.    513. While the lending rates of various categories of borrowers depend on the risk  and reward perceptions, the rates have declined for most categories of borrowers over  time. At a disaggregated level, the weighted average lending rate for personal loans was  higher while it was the lower for housing loans (Chart 2).

From the perspective of borrowers as also from the point of view of  sustainability of debt, what matters is the real interest rate. The Fisher equation gives  4 the relationship between the real and nominal interest rates . In the Fisher hypothesis  time preferences of the public and technological constraints determining the return on  5 real investment which is assumed to be constant . So the nominal rate moves with  inflation. The Fisher equation can be used in either ex ante (before) or ex post (after)  sense. As ex ante inflation is not observable, one could compute the expectations  augmented Fisher equation given the desired real rate of return and an expected rate of    inflation over the period of a loan. While there is no unique way to compute expected  inflation, the real interest rate ex post can be computed as nominal interest rate minus  realized inflation rate.                                                        4   i = r + ?; where i is nominal interest rate, r is real interest rate and  ? is the inflation rate.  5   Fisher, Irving (1930), The Theory of Interest, (New York: Macmillan).    6 Per cent 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-0815. As investment decisions are made over a medium-term horizon, it is important  to consider real lending rates in a medium-term perspective. Borrowers tend to view  the nominal lending rate in terms of a desired real rate of return and expected  inflation. Although several methods, including surveys, are employed to calculate  expected inflation, it is difficult to assign expected values with a reasonable degree of  precision given the uncertainty surrounding the future outcomes.  This is more  pertinent to developing economies like ours which are subject to structural economic  factors and unanticipated supply shocks.       16. Another useful way to address this issue is to derive expectations by  6 smoothing the inflation series. This presupposes that expectations are adaptive which  is often the case in economies and markets with asymmetric information.  Furthermore, given monetary policy credibility, the underlying inflation expectations  are generally stable but for the deviations caused by short term volatility due to  7 transitory factors .      17. In our context, computation of real interest rate, even in an ex post sense,  becomes challenging because of lack of a comprehensive measure of consumer price  inflation.  Hence, I show here three alternative ex post measures of real lending rates  based on: (i) the wholesale price index, which is our headline measure of inflation; (ii)  the GDP deflator, the most comprehensive measure of inflation; and (iii) the  consumer price index for industrial worker (CPIIW), which is the most representative  of consumer price indices.  It can be seen that the alternative measures of real interest  rates have moved in tandem though there have been significant year to year variations  (Chart 3).                                                     6  Backward looking.  7  India is a moderate inflation country with the long-term average inflation of about 7.5 per cent which  has come down to around 5 per cent in the recent years.  Hence the long-term inflation expectations can  be assumed to be stable.   7Chart 3 : Measures of Real  Weighted Average Lending Rates of Banks WPI-based 12.0 CPIIW-based GDP Deflator - based 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 2.0 Year     18. If one assumes the inflation expectations to be adaptive then one could  consider   taking a larger time frame for economic agents memory than just  pertaining to the immediate time interval. Here I have taken a two-year moving  average series of inflation rate to represent adaptive inflation expectations and for  estimating ex post real lending rates. The smoothed real lending rate series reinforces  our earlier observation that lending rates rose in the 1990s and declined during the  2000s (Chart 4).

Credit Growth and Real Lending Rates    19. Now I turn to the relationship between real GDP growth and real lending  rates.  Technically, the real GDP growth is a measure of average real rate of return in  the economy.  Ideally, the real lending rates should not be too much out of alignment  with the real GDP growth rate.  The data for the period 1990-91 to 2008-09 show that  real lending rates were higher than real GDP growth particularly during 1997-98 to  8 2002-03 .  This scenario has clearly changed since 2003-04 concurrent with the high  growth phase of the Indian economy.  The weighted average real lending rate has  since remained below the real GDP growth rate (Chart 5).    Chart 5 : Real GDP Growth and Real Lending Rate 14.0 12.0 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 Year GDP Growth Rate GDP Def lator -based real lending rate     20. From a business cycle perspective, one could examine relationship between  real interest rate and credit growth. The assessment of real lending rate in the context  of underlying credit cycles can potentially throw light on aspects of cyclicality in  economic activity and its relationship with financial sector dynamics. High (low) real  interest rates coincide with low (high) credit growth (Chart 6).                                                      8  Analysing the data for 1990-91 to 2001-02, Dr. Rakesh Mohan, former Deputy Governor had  observed, "effective real lending rate continues to remain high  which has adverse systemic  implications".  Valedictory address at the Bank Economists' Conference 2002, at Bangalore, December  29, 2002   9 Per cent 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09       21. In terms of real sector activity, approximated by the index of industrial  production (IIP), the industrial growth cycles are also inversely related to the real  interest rate cycles (Chart 7).           1022. The base rate will prompt banks to make a better assessment of risk in pricing  of loans. It is expected to be more responsive to the stance of monetary policy which  should facilitate movement in effective real lending rates consistent with the rates of  return in the economy.  Conclusions  23. Let me conclude now.   First, the introduction of the base rate system along side removal of interest  rate ceiling on small loans and freeing of rupee export credit interest rate brings to  fruition over two decades of efforts to deregulate the lending rates of banks. This is  expected to enhance the allocative efficiency of the financial intermediation process  by banks.   Second, deregulation of lending rates will promote financial inclusion with  greater credit flow to agriculture and small business. This, together with other specific  measures taken by the Reserve Bank for financial inclusion, will draw borrowers  away from the informal financial sector to the formal financial sector and thus,  facilitate credit penetration.   st  Third, the base rate system that comes into effect from 1 July 2010 gives  complete freedom to banks in their loan pricing decisions while ensuring  transparency. Banks have unlimited access to public deposits and privileged access to  the liquidity facility of the Reserve Bank. Hence there is a greater need for  transparency and responsible lending practices for public purposes.   Fourth, the base rates of banks will mirror their relative efficiency and cost  structure. While lending rates tend to be sticky, it is expected that the base rate system  will show greater flexibility and strengthen both the interest rate and credit channels  of monetary transmission.   Fifth, the new system gives the freedom to banks to choose other market  related benchmarks besides their base rates for pricing floating rate products.  This  could promote development of market benchmarks. It could also deepen the money  market to facilitate short-term liquidity management by banks.   11 Sixth, there is some apprehension that the base rate system may raise the  effective cost of borrowings. This is unlikely because corporates have access to  multiple sources of funds and hence the effective borrowing rates will be determined  by market competition.    Seventh, the nominal effective lending rate of the banking system which  remained higher in the 1990s have declined significantly in the 2000s.   This can  largely be attributed to moderation in overall inflation, reduction in inflation risk  premia, interest rate deregulation and increasing efficiency of the banking system.     Eighth, the computation of real lending rate becomes challenging without a  comprehensive measure of consumer price inflation and difficulties in measuring  inflation expectations. Nevertheless, ex post measures of real lending rates over the  last two decades show a clear pattern. The real lending rates rose in the 1990s and  then declined in the 2000s.  The real weighted average lending rate was higher than  the real GDP growth rate, particularly during the period 1997-98 to 2002-03.   Thereafter, the real weighted average lending rate has declined concurrent with the  high growth phase of the Indian economy.   Finally, credit and industrial output cycles show inverse relationship with real  interest rate. However, there is a need for further research to better understand the  relationship between credit and interest rate cycles and its implications for sustainable  growth.                              12
